November 16, 2017

Dear Stockholder:

We cordially invite you to attend a special meeting of the stockholders of Silver Spring Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
which we refer to as “Silver Spring,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our,” to be held on January 3, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. (Pacific
Time), at Silver Spring’s offices at 230 W. Tasman Drive, San Jose, CA 95134.

At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as
of September 17, 2017, as it may be amended from time to time, which we refer to as the “merger agreement,” by and among Silver
Spring, Itron, Inc., a Washington corporation, which we refer to as “Itron,” and Ivory Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Itron, which we refer to as “Merger Sub,” and approve the merger. Pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge with and into Silver Spring, which we refer to as the
“merger,” with Silver Spring continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Itron.

If the merger is consummated, you will be entitled to receive $16.25 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding
taxes, for each share of Silver Spring common stock, $0.001 par value per share, which we refer to as “Silver Spring common
stock,” you own (unless you are entitled to exercise, and have properly exercised, your appraisal rights in compliance in all respects
with, Delaware law).

Your proxy is being solicited by the board of directors of Silver Spring. The Silver Spring board of directors, after considering all
factors it deemed relevant, and after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, unanimously (i) determined that the merger
agreement and the merger were fair to, and in the best interests of, Silver Spring and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared
advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and (iii) resolved to recommend
that Silver Spring stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger.

The Silver Spring board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement and approve the merger and “FOR” the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting if necessary
or appropriate in the view of the Silver Spring board of directors, including to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger.

The accompanying proxy statement provides you with detailed information about the merger agreement and the merger and
provides specific information regarding the special meeting. A copy of the merger agreement is included as Annex A to the
accompanying proxy statement. The accompanying proxy statement also describes the actions and determinations of the Silver
Spring board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger. We urge you to read the
accompanying proxy statement, including any documents incorporated by reference, and the annexes carefully and in their entirety.
Your vote is very important to us regardless of the number of shares of Silver Spring common stock you own. The merger
cannot be consummated unless the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock entitled to
vote at the special meeting vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. If your shares
of Silver Spring common stock are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you should instruct your broker,
bank or other nominee on how to vote in accordance with the voting instruction card furnished by your broker, bank or
other nominee. If you fail to vote on the merger agreement and the merger or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other
nominee on how to vote, the effect will be the same as a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of
the merger.

We greatly appreciate your cooperation in voting your shares of Silver Spring common stock. The enclosed proxy card contains
instructions regarding voting. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, we request that you complete the enclosed
proxy that will enable your shares of Silver Spring common stock to be voted on the matters to be considered at the special meeting
even if you are unable or do not wish to attend. If

1. Adoption of the Merger Agreement and Approval of the Merger. To consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 17, 2017, as it may be amended from time to time, which we refer

“Itron,” and Ivory Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Itron, which we refer to as
“Merger Sub,” and approve the merger, which we refer to as the “merger proposal.” Pursuant to the terms of the merger

meeting if necessary or appropriate in the view of the Silver Spring board of directors, including to solicit additional

stockholders present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote (assuming the presence of a quorum at the

A: Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 9, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, are
entitled to vote at the special meeting. You will be entitled to one vote on each of the proposals presented in this proxy
statement for each share of Silver Spring common stock that you held on the record date.

Q: What happens if I sell or transfer my shares of Silver Spring common stock after the record date but before the special
meeting?

A: If you sell or transfer your shares of Silver Spring common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless
special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise
transfer your shares of Silver Spring common stock and each of you notifies Silver Spring of such special arrangements, you
will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration, if the merger is consummated, to the person to whom you sell or
transfer your shares of Silver Spring common stock, but you will retain your right to vote these shares at the special meeting.
Therefore, even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Silver Spring common stock after the record date, you are
encouraged to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy or vote via the Internet or via telephone.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What proposals will be voted on at the special meeting?

A: At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on:

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger (which we refer to as the “merger proposal”); and

• a proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate in the view of the Silver Spring
board of directors, including to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting
to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger (which we refer to as the “adjournment proposal”).

Q: What vote is required to approve each of the proposals?

A: Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of Silver
Spring common stock at the close of business on the record date entitled to vote at the special meeting. As of the record date,
there were 54,142,118 shares of Silver Spring common stock outstanding. Abstentions, failures to vote and “broker non-votes”
(as more fully described below) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal.

Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal by the
stockholders present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote (assuming that a quorum is present at
the special meeting). Abstentions and shares of Silver Spring common stock not represented in person or by proxy at the
special meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the adjournment proposal (unless, with respect to shares of
Silver Spring common stock, such shares are necessary to satisfy the requirement that a quorum is present at the special
meeting).

Q: How does the Silver Spring board of directors recommend that I vote?

A: Upon careful consideration, the Silver Spring board of directors unanimously (i) determined that the merger agreement and the
merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, Silver Spring and its stockholders and (ii) resolved to recommend that Silver
Spring stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger.

The Silver Spring board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal and “FOR”
the adjournment proposal.

For a discussion of certain factors that the Silver Spring board of directors considered in reaching its decision to approve and
declare advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, and recommend that
stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal, see the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and
Approval of the Merger—Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 42 of this proxy statement. In addition, in considering the
recommendation of the Silver Spring board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that some
of our directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Silver Spring
stockholders generally. For a discussion of these interests, please see the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement and Approval of the Merger—Interests of Silver Spring’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning
on page 58 of this proxy statement.

Q: How do Silver Spring’s directors and executive officers intend to vote their shares of Silver Spring common stock in
respect of the merger proposal?

A: We currently expect that Silver Spring’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares of Silver Spring common stock
in favor of the merger proposal and the adjournment proposal. At the close of business on the record date for the special
meeting, directors and executive officers of Silver Spring and their affiliates were entitled to vote 12,089,654 shares of Silver
Spring common stock at the special meeting, or approximately 22.3% of the shares of Silver Spring common stock outstanding
on such date.

Warren Weiss, one of our directors, and certain stockholders affiliated with Mr. Weiss, entered into a voting agreement with
Itron as described in the section entitled “Terms of the Voting Agreement” beginning on

TABLE OF CONTENTS

page 104 of this proxy statement. At the close of business on the record date for the special meeting, Silver Spring stockholders
subject to the voting agreement beneficially own approximately 19.5% of the shares of Silver Spring common stock
outstanding on such date.

Q: What constitutes a quorum?

A: The presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Silver
Spring common stock entitled to vote at any meeting of Silver Spring stockholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of any business at such meeting. As of November 9, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, 27,071,060 shares of Silver
Spring common stock will be required to obtain a quorum. When a quorum is present to organize a meeting of Silver Spring
stockholders, it is not broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any Silver Spring stockholders. Abstentions and any broker non-
votes will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

Q: What is the difference between holding shares of Silver Spring common stock as a stockholder of record and as a
beneficial owner?

A: Most of our stockholders hold their shares of Silver Spring common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than
directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are certain distinctions between shares of Silver Spring common stock
held of record and shares owned beneficially through a broker, bank or other nominee.

• Stockholder of Record. If your shares of Silver Spring common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer
agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to such shares of
Silver Spring common stock, and these proxy materials are being sent directly to you by us. As the stockholder of record,
you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to us or to vote your shares of Silver Spring common stock in person
at the special meeting. We have enclosed a proxy card for you to use for such purpose.

• Beneficial Owner. If your shares of Silver Spring common stock are held in a brokerage account or in the name of a
broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of such shares of Silver Spring common stock, and
these proxy materials are being forwarded to you together with a voting instruction card by your broker, bank or other
nominee who is considered the stockholder of record with respect to such shares of Silver Spring common stock. As the
beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Silver
Spring common stock, and you are also invited to attend the special meeting where you can vote your shares of Silver
Spring common stock in person by following the procedure described below.

Because a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares of Silver Spring common stock at
the special meeting, unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares of Silver
Spring common stock giving you the right to vote the shares of Silver Spring common stock in person at the special meeting.
You should allow yourself enough time prior to the special meeting to obtain this proxy from your broker, bank or other
nominee who is the stockholder of record.

Q: How do I vote my shares of Silver Spring common stock?

A: Before you vote, you should carefully read and consider the information contained in, or incorporated by reference in, this
proxy statement, including the annexes. You should also determine whether you hold your shares of Silver Spring common
stock directly in your name as a registered holder (which means that you are a “stockholder of record”) or through a broker,
bank or other nominee (which means that you are a “beneficial owner”), because this will determine the procedure that you
must follow in order to vote.

If you are the stockholder of record, you may vote in any of the following ways:

• Via the Internet. If you choose to vote via the Internet, sign on to the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card and
follow the instructions for voting your shares. You will need the control number shown on your proxy card in order to
vote.

• Via Telephone. If you choose to vote via telephone, use a touch-tone telephone to call the phone number indicated on the
enclosed proxy card and follow the voice prompts. You will need the control number shown on your proxy card in order to
vote.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• Via Mail. If you choose to vote via mail, simply mark, date and sign your proxy card and return it in the postage-paid
envelope provided. Proxy cards that are returned without a signature will not be counted as present at the special meeting
and cannot be voted.

• At the Special Meeting. You may attend and vote in person at the special meeting. If you attend and vote in person at the
special meeting, then any votes that you previously submitted, whether by the Internet, telephone or mail, will be
superseded by the vote that you cast during the special meeting.

We recommend that you vote as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the special meeting, so that the vote count
will not be delayed. Both the Internet and the telephone provide convenient, cost-effective alternatives to returning your proxy
card by mail. If you vote your shares of Silver Spring common stock through the Internet, you may incur costs associated with
electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers.

If you are a beneficial owner, you are not the stockholder of record and you may not vote your shares of Silver Spring common
stock at the special meeting, unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares of
Silver Spring common stock giving you the right to vote your shares of Silver Spring common stock at the special meeting.
You should allow enough time prior to the special meeting to obtain this proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee who is
the stockholder of record.

If you are a beneficial owner, please refer to the information on the voting instruction card forwarded to you by your broker,
bank or other nominee to determine which voting options are available to you. In many cases, you may be able to submit your
voting instructions by the Internet or telephone. If you do not properly submit your voting instructions, the broker, bank or
other nominee will not be able to vote on the merger proposal. Under applicable rules, brokers, banks and other nominees have
the discretion to vote on routine matters. The merger proposal in this proxy statement is a non-routine matter, and therefore
brokers, banks and other nominees cannot vote on the merger proposal without your instructions. This is called a “broker non-
vote.”

Broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal and will have no effect on the outcome
of the vote on the adjournment proposal. Therefore, it is important that you cast your vote by instructing your broker, bank or
other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of Silver Spring common stock.

Q: Do I need to attend the special meeting?

A: No. While our stockholders of record may exercise their right to vote their shares in person at the special meeting, it is not
necessary for you to attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares of Silver Spring common stock.

Q: What happens if I return my proxy card but I do not indicate how to vote?

A: If you properly return your proxy card but do not include instructions on how to vote, your shares of Silver Spring common
stock will be voted “FOR” the approval of the merger proposal and “FOR” the approval of the adjournment proposal. We do
not currently intend to present any other proposals for consideration at the special meeting.

Q: What happens if I abstain from voting on a proposal?

A: It is important that you vote your shares of Silver Spring common stock. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, which we refer to as the “DGCL,” the approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
all outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Accordingly, your abstention will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal. Your abstention will have no effect on the adjournment
proposal.

Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card or otherwise submitted my vote?

A: Yes. Even after you sign and submit the proxy card or voting instruction card in the form accompanying this proxy statement,
or vote via the Internet or via telephone, you retain the power to revoke your proxy or

TABLE OF CONTENTS

change your vote. You can revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is exercised by delivering written notice
to Silver Spring at 230 W. Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134, Attn: General Counsel, specifying such revocation. You
may also change your vote by timely delivering a valid, later-dated proxy, or by attending and voting in person at the special
meeting. If you have voted via the Internet or by telephone, you may change your vote by signing on to the website and
following the prompts or calling the toll-free number again and following the instructions. If your shares of Silver Spring
common stock are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee
in order to revoke your proxy or change your vote.

Q: What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?

A: This means that you hold shares of Silver Spring common stock in more than one way. For example, you may own some shares
of Silver Spring common stock directly as a stockholder of record and other shares of Silver Spring common stock as a
beneficial owner through a broker, bank or other nominee, or you may own shares of Silver Spring common stock as a
beneficial owner through more than one broker, bank or other nominee. In these situations, you may receive more than one set
of proxy materials or multiple control numbers for use in submitting your proxy. To ensure that ALL of your shares of Silver
Spring common stock are voted, sign and return each proxy card or voting instruction card that you receive or, if you submit
your proxy through the Internet or by telephone, vote at least once for each proxy card or control number that you receive.

Q: Will my shares of Silver Spring common stock held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined
for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?

A: No. Because any shares of Silver Spring common stock you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different
stockholder (i.e., your broker, bank or other nominee) than shares of Silver Spring common stock you may hold of record, any
shares of Silver Spring common stock held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of Silver
Spring common stock you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares of Silver Spring common stock in various registered
forms (e.g., jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor), you will receive, and will need to sign
and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of Silver Spring common stock because they are held in a different form of
record ownership. Shares of Silver Spring common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an
authorized officer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the proxy card. Shares of Silver
Spring common stock held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account. This
means that, to ensure all your shares of Silver Spring common stock are voted at the special meeting, you should read carefully
any proxy materials received and follow the instructions included therewith.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be consummated?

A: Silver Spring and Itron currently anticipate that the merger will be consummated in the first quarter of 2018, although there can
be no assurance that Silver Spring and Itron will be able to consummate the merger by such time or at all. The parties expect to
consummate the merger promptly following the approval of the merger proposal, the receipt of all required regulatory
approvals specified in the merger agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions precedent to the parties’
respective obligations to consummate the merger, each as further set forth in the merger agreement. There may be a substantial
amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger. See the section entitled “Terms of the Merger
Agreement—Conditions to Consummation of the Merger” beginning on page 97 of this proxy statement.

Q: If the merger is consummated, how will I receive the cash for my shares of Silver Spring common stock?

A: If the merger is consummated and your shares of Silver Spring common stock are held in book-entry form or in the name of a
broker, bank or other nominee, the cash proceeds will be deposited into your bank or brokerage account upon receipt of an
agent’s message by the paying agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the paying agent may reasonably request). If
you hold your shares of Silver Spring common stock in certificated form, you will receive a letter of transmittal with
instructions on how to send your

shares of Silver Spring common stock to the paying agent in connection with the merger. The paying agent will issue and
deliver to you a check for your shares of Silver Spring common stock after you comply with these instructions. See the section
entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Payment of Merger Consideration; Exchange of Shares in the Merger” beginning on
page 78 of this proxy statement.

Q: If I hold my shares of Silver Spring common stock in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?

A: No. Please do not send your stock certificates now. If the merger is consummated, stockholders holding shares of Silver Spring
common stock in certificated form will receive a letter of transmittal instructing such stockholders to send their stock
certificates to the paying agent in order to receive the cash payment of the merger consideration for each share of Silver Spring
common stock represented by such stock certificates. Holders of stock certificates should use the letter of transmittal to
exchange their stock certificates for the cash payment to which they are entitled upon consummation of the merger. Please do
not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

Q: What happens if the merger is not consummated?

A: If the stockholders do not vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger, the merger agreement is terminated or if
the merger is not consummated for any other reason, Silver Spring stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of
Silver Spring common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Silver Spring common stock will continue to be listed and
traded on the NYSE, and Silver Spring will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In certain circumstances, we may be
required to pay a termination fee, or we or Itron may seek damages or other remedies, in each case, as described under the
section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Termination; Effect of Termination” and “Terms of the Merger Agreement—
Termination Fee” beginning on page 99 and page 101, respectively, of this proxy statement.

Q: Will I have appraisal rights as a result of the merger?

A: Yes. If the merger is consummated, Silver Spring stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement, who continuously hold such shares through the effective time of the merger, who properly perfect appraisal rights in
respect of their shares of Silver Spring common stock, and who meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements
described herein will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means
that holders of shares of Silver Spring common stock may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of Silver Spring common stock, exclusive of any
elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid on the
amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any
voluntary cash payments made by Silver Spring pursuant to Section 262(h) of the DGCL, as described in more detail below).
Silver Spring stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements
for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL
regarding appraisal rights is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.

Q: Who will count the votes?

A: The votes will be counted by a representative of the Veaco Group, which will act as the inspector of election appointed for the
special meeting.

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?

A: Silver Spring intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report
on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports Silver Spring files with the SEC are
publicly available when filed. See the section entitled “Where Stockholders Can Find More Information” beginning on page
111 of this proxy statement.

SUMMARY

This summary highlights selected information from this proxy statement and may not contain all of the information that is
important to you. To understand the merger fully and for a more complete description of the legal terms of the merger, you should
read carefully this entire proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents we refer to in this proxy
statement. See “Where Stockholders Can Find More Information” beginning on page 111 of this proxy statement. The merger
agreement is included as Annex A to this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement, which is the legal
document governing the merger, in its entirety. Each item in this summary references another section of this proxy statement with
more detailed disclosure about such item. Throughout this proxy statement, all references to “Silver Spring,” the “Company,”
“we,” “our,” “us” and similar words refer to Silver Spring Networks, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or the
context otherwise requires. In addition, throughout this proxy statement, we refer to Itron, Inc. as “Itron,” and to Ivory Merger
Sub, Inc. as “Merger Sub.”

Parties Involved in the Merger (see page 24)

Silver Spring Networks, Inc.

Silver Spring, a Delaware corporation, has more than a decade of experience creating, building and successfully deploying large-
scale networks and solutions enabling the Internet of Things, or IoT, for critical infrastructure. The IoT refers to a system where a
diversity of physical devices has the capacity to communicate using Internet technologies. Our first area of focus was in energy,
creating a leading smart grid network platform by applying advanced networking technology and solutions to the power grid. We
have broadened our focus beyond the smart grid to other utility networks including gas and water, other critical infrastructure
such as street lights, which enable smarter and more efficient cities, and additional industrial verticals which could benefit from
our platform.

Itron

Itron, a Washington corporation, is among the leading technology and services companies dedicated to the resourceful use of
electricity, natural gas, and water. Itron provides comprehensive solutions that measure, manage, and analyze energy and water
use. Itron’s broad product portfolio helps utilities responsibly and efficiently manage resources, which product portfolio includes
electricity, gas, water and thermal energy measurement devices and control technology, communications systems, software, as
well as managed and consulting services. Itron’s common stock, no par value per share, which we refer to as “Itron common
stock,” is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ITRI.”

Ivory Merger Sub, Inc.

Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Itron, is a Delaware corporation that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into
the merger agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger. Pursuant
to the terms of the merger agreement, and subject to the conditions thereof, at the effective time of the Merger, Merger Sub will
merge with and into Silver Spring, with Silver Spring continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Itron.

The Merger (see page 30)

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, and subject to the conditions thereof, and in accordance with the DGCL at the
effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into Silver Spring. As a result of the merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will cease, with Silver Spring continuing as the surviving corporation of the merger and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Itron. If the merger is consummated, Silver Spring stockholders will not own any capital stock of the surviving
corporation as a result of the merger. As used in this proxy statement, “surviving corporation” refers to Silver Spring as the
surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Itron following the consummation of the merger.

Merger Consideration (see page 76)

At the effective time of the merger, each share of Silver Spring common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, other than shares (i) held in the treasury of Silver Spring or owned by Itron, Merger Sub or any of
their respective direct or indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries, which, in each case, will be cancelled without any conversion
thereof and no payment or distribution will be made with

respect thereto (we refer to such shares as “excluded shares”) or (ii) held by stockholders who have not voted in favor of the
merger proposal and are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (we refer to such shares
as “dissenting shares”), will be converted into the right to receive $16.25 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable
withholding taxes, which we refer to as the “merger consideration.”

Expected Timing of the Merger

The parties expect to consummate the merger promptly following the approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and
approve of the merger, which proposal we refer to as the “merger proposal,” by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
majority of all outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, the receipt of all required
regulatory approvals specified in the merger agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions precedent to the
parties’ respective obligations to consummate the merger, each as further set forth in the merger agreement. There may be a
substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger.

Silver Spring currently anticipates that the merger will be consummated in the first quarter of 2018. As noted in the above
paragraph, however, consummation of the merger is subject to various conditions, and it is possible that factors outside the
control of Silver Spring and/or Itron could result in the merger being consummated at a later time, or not at all.

The Special Meeting (see page 25)

Date, Time and Place

The special meeting will be held on January 3, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. (Pacific Time), at Silver Spring’s offices located at 230 W.
Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, you will be asked: (i) to consider and vote upon the merger proposal and (ii) to consider and vote upon a
proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate in the view of the Silver Spring board of
directors, including to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the
merger agreement and approve the merger (we refer to this proposal as the “adjournment proposal”).

Record Date and Voting Information

Only stockholders who hold shares of Silver Spring common stock at the close of business on November 9, 2017, the record date
for the special meeting, will be entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each stockholder of record on the record date will be
entitled to one vote for each share of Silver Spring common stock held as of the record date on each matter properly brought
before the special meeting.

The presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of Silver Spring common stock entitled to vote at the special
meeting is necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business at the special meeting. As of the
record date for the special meeting, there were 54,142,118 shares of Silver Spring common stock outstanding and entitled to vote
at the special meeting. Accordingly, 27,071,060 shares of Silver Spring common stock must be represented in person or by proxy
by stockholders entitled to vote to constitute a quorum for the special meeting.

Required Vote

Adoption of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of Silver
Spring common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of the votes cast on the adjournment proposal by the stockholders present or represented by proxy at the special
meeting and entitled to vote.

Voting by Stockholders

If your shares of Silver Spring common stock are held in your name by Silver Spring’s transfer agent, Computershare Trust
Company, N.A., which we refer to as Computershare, you may:

• vote through the Internet or by telephone – in order to do so, please follow the instructions shown on your proxy card;

• vote by mail – in order to do so, simply complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card before the special
meeting in the envelope provided; or

• vote in person at the special meeting – if you are a stockholder of record and you attend the special meeting, you may
vote in person by following the procedures described above, and any previously submitted proxies will be superseded
by the vote you cast at the special meeting.

If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of Silver Spring common stock in the name of a broker, bank or other
nominee, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Silver Spring common
stock. The broker, bank or other nominee cannot vote on the merger proposal without your instructions. Therefore, it is important
that you cast your vote or instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of Silver Spring
common stock. If your shares of Silver Spring common stock are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee and you
wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you must provide a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee.

Proxies received at any time before the special meeting and that are not expired, revoked or superseded before being voted will be
voted at the special meeting.

Abstentions, broker non-votes and shares of Silver Spring common stock not represented at the special meeting will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal. It is very important that our stockholders vote their shares of Silver
Spring common stock, so, in the case of stockholders of record, please promptly complete and return the enclosed proxy card or
submit your proxy via the Internet or by telephone, and in the case of beneficial owners that hold their shares of Silver Spring
common stock in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, please instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how you
wish to vote your shares of Silver Spring common stock.

Abstentions and shares of Silver Spring common stock not represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting will have no
effect on the adjournment proposal (assuming, with respect to shares not represented in person or by proxy at the special meeting,
the presence of a quorum at the special meeting).

Revocation of Proxies

Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change such proxy at any time before it is
voted. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting
by:

• submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures described
above, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to Silver Spring;

• attending the special meeting and voting in person; or

• delivering to the Secretary of Silver Spring a written notice of revocation c/o Silver Spring Networks, Inc., 230 W.
Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134, Attn: General Counsel.

Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions
described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please also note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new
proxy card to Silver Spring or by sending a written notice of revocation to Silver Spring, you should ensure that you send your
new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by Silver Spring before the special meeting.

If your shares of Silver Spring common stock are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the
instructions of such broker, bank or other nominee regarding the revocation of proxies.

Voting by Silver Spring’s Directors and Executive Officers; Voting Agreement

As of the close of business on November 9, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, our directors and executive officers and
their affiliates were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 12,089,654 shares of Silver Spring common stock at the special meeting,
representing approximately 22.3% of the outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock as of the record date. We currently
expect that Silver Spring’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares of Silver Spring common stock in favor of the
merger proposal.

In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Warren Weiss, a stockholder and a member of the Silver Spring board
of directors, and certain other stockholders affiliated with Mr. Weiss, entered into a voting agreement with Itron. The voting
agreement obligates Mr. Weiss and such affiliated stockholders to, among other things, vote their shares of Silver Spring common
stock in favor of the merger proposal and vote against any competing transaction. The voting agreement terminates on the earlier
of the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, the effective time of the merger and such dates on which
the merger agreement is amended to change the form of, or reduce the amount of, merger consideration to be paid thereunder. As
of the close of business on the record date for the special meeting, Silver Spring stockholders subject to the voting agreement
beneficially own approximately 19.5% of the outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock. The voting agreement is
described in the section entitled “Terms of the Voting Agreement” beginning on page 104 of this proxy statement and a copy of the
voting agreement is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement.

Recommendation of the Silver Spring Board of Directors (see page 46)

The Silver Spring board of directors, after carefully considering all factors that the Silver Spring board of directors deemed
relevant and after consulting with its legal and financial advisors, unanimously (i) determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, were fair to, and in the best interests of, Silver Spring and its
stockholders, (ii) declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, and
(iii) resolved to recommend that Silver Spring stockholders vote in favor of the merger and adopt the merger agreement, all upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement.

The Silver Spring board of directors unanimously recommends that Silver Spring stockholders vote “FOR” the merger
proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

Reasons for the Merger (see page 42)

For a description of the material reasons considered by the Silver Spring board of directors in resolving to recommend approval
of the merger proposal, see the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and Approval of the Merger—
Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 42 of this proxy statement.

Opinion of Silver Spring’s Financial Advisor (see page 46)

At a meeting of the Silver Spring board of directors held on September 17, 2017, Evercore Group L.L.C, which we refer to as
“Evercore,” rendered its oral opinion to the Silver Spring board of directors, which opinion was subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated September 17, 2017, that, as of the date thereof, and based upon and subject to the factors,
procedures, assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to
be received by the holders of Silver Spring common stock entitled to receive such merger consideration was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders of Silver Spring common stock.

The full text of Evercore’s written opinion, dated September 17, 2017, which sets forth, among other things, the factors
considered, procedures followed, assumptions made and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken
by Evercore in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety. Evercore’s opinion was addressed to, and for the information and benefit of, the Silver Spring
board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger. Evercore’s opinion did not address the relative merits of
the merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to Silver Spring, nor did it
address the underlying business decision of Silver Spring to engage in the merger. Evercore’s opinion did not constitute a
recommendation to the Silver Spring board of directors or to any other persons in respect of the merger, including as to
how any holder of shares of Silver Spring common stock should vote or act with respect to the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Financing of the Merger (see page 57)

The merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Itron. However, Itron expects to finance the aggregate merger
consideration with a combination of cash on hand and the incurrence of new debt, including a term loan facility and senior
unsecured notes.

In connection with entering into the merger agreement, Itron entered into a commitment letter, which we refer to as the
“commitment letter,” dated as of September 17, 2017, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, which we refer to as “Wells
Fargo Bank,” WF Investment Holdings, LLC, which we refer to as “WF Investments,” and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, which
we refer to as “Wells Fargo Securities,” and, together with Wells Fargo Bank and Wells Fargo Investments, which we refer to as
the “initial commitment parties.” Pursuant to the commitment letter, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the
initial commitment parties committed to provide (i) senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to
$1,102.5 million, which includes a new $400 million senior secured term loan B facility, and (ii) a senior unsecured bridge loan
facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $350 million if Itron does not issue senior unsecured notes with an aggregate
principal amount of at least $350 million on or prior to the consummation of the merger.

On October 3, 2017, Itron entered into an amended and restated commitment letter, which we refer to as the “amended
commitment letter,” with the initial commitment parties, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which we refer to as “JPMorgan, ” ING
Bank, N.V., Dublin Branch, which we refer to as “ING,” BNP Paribas, Bank of the West and U.S. Bank National Association,
together with the initial commitment parties, JPMorgan, ING, BNP Paribas and Bank of the West, which we refer to as the
“current commitment parties.” Pursuant to the amended commitment letter, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, the current commitment parties committed to provide increased senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal
amount of $1,125.0 million, which includes a new $400 million senior secured term loan B facility, in addition to the senior
unsecured bridge loan facility described above.

Together with Itron’s cash on hand, the financing will be used to refinance Itron’s existing credit facilities, if necessary, and to
finance, in part, Itron’s acquisition of Silver Spring. There can be no assurance that any replacement or supplemental financing in
lieu of the amended commitment letter will be available to Itron on acceptable terms or at all. Itron’s ability to obtain additional
debt financing, including financing to replace or supplement the debt available under the amended commitment letter, will be
subject to various factors, including market conditions, and Itron’s and Silver Spring’s operating performance and credit ratings.

Interests of Silver Spring’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 58)

In considering the unanimous recommendation of the Silver Spring board of directors that Silver Spring stockholders approve the
merger proposal, Silver Spring stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of Silver Spring have
certain interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Silver Spring stockholders generally. These
interests are described in more detail in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and Approval of the
Merger—Interests of Silver Spring’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 58 of this proxy
statement. The Silver Spring board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
evaluating the merger agreement and in reaching its decision to unanimously (i) determine that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger were fair to, and in the best interests of, Silver Spring and its
stockholders, (ii) declare advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, and
(iii) recommend that Silver Spring stockholders vote in favor of the merger and adopt the merger agreement.

Treatment of Options

Each vested option to purchase shares of Silver Spring common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger and that has a per share exercise price that is less than the merger consideration will be cancelled at the effective
time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to such option and (ii) the excess of the merger consideration
over the per share exercise price under such option.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Each unvested option to purchase shares of Silver Spring common stock (other than an unvested option held by a non-employee
member of the Silver Spring board of directors), that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, has a
per share exercise price that is less than the merger consideration and is held by a then-current service provider to Silver Spring,
which we refer to as an “assumed option,” will be assumed by Itron at the effective time and converted into and become an option
to acquire Itron common stock, which we refer to as an “adjusted option,” on the same material terms and conditions (including
vesting) as were applicable under the corresponding assumed option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, as
follows:

• the number of shares of Itron common stock subject to each adjusted option will be the number of shares of Silver
Spring common stock that were subject to the corresponding assumed option immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger multiplied by an exchange ratio determined by dividing the merger consideration by the volume-weighted
average of the trading prices of shares of Itron common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the ten trading
days ending with, and including, the trading day that is the closing date of the merger, which we refer to as the
“exchange ratio,” rounded down to the nearest whole share of Itron common stock; and

• the per share exercise price for the Itron common stock issuable upon exercise of each adjusted option will be the
applicable per share exercise price of the corresponding assumed option, as in effect immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger divided by the exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

Any option to purchase shares of Silver Spring common stock held by a non-employee member of the Silver Spring board of
directors that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and that has a per share exercise price that is
less than the merger consideration, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled in exchange for an amount in cash, less
applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to
such option and (ii) the excess of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price under such option.

Each option to purchase shares of Silver Spring common stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger, whether vested or unvested, that has a per share exercise price that is equal or greater than the merger consideration
will become vested and exercisable by the holder thereof, and each such option that remains unexercised and outstanding at the
effective time will be cancelled with no payment made therefor.

Treatment of Restricted Stock Units

Each Silver Spring restricted stock unit, which we refer to as an “RSU,” that remains outstanding and is fully vested as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled at the effective time and automatically converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash, less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Silver Spring common stock subject to such RSU and (ii) the merger consideration.

Each RSU (other than an unvested RSU held by a non-employee member of the Silver Spring board of directors) that remains
outstanding and is unvested as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which we refer to as an “assumed RSU,”
will be assumed by Itron at the effective time of the merger and converted into a restricted stock unit to receive, on substantially
the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as were applicable under such assumed RSU immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger, a number of shares of Itron common stock equal to the number of shares of Silver Spring common stock that
were subject to such assumed RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by the exchange ratio and
rounded down to the nearest whole share of Itron common stock.

Each RSU held by a non-employee member of the Silver Spring board of directors that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled at the effective time and converted into the right to
receive an amount of cash, less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Silver
Spring common stock subject to such RSU and (ii) the merger consideration.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Treatment of Performance Stock Units

Each performance stock unit, which we refer to as a “PSU,” that was granted during 2015 and that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger and will terminate
without the payment of any consideration therefor and the holders of such PSUs granted during 2015 will cease to have any rights
with respect thereto.

For each PSU that was granted in 2017 and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, the
performance conditions will be deemed satisfied at 100% of the target level of achievement and (i) the portion of each such PSU
that is outstanding and unvested as to service-based vesting conditions will be treated as an assumed RSU and assumed by Itron
as described above, and (ii) the portion of each such PSU that is outstanding and vested as to both performance conditions and
service-based conditions will be treated as an RSU (as described above, that is cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive an amount of cash (less any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of
shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to such PSU and (ii) the merger consideration).

Cancellation and Stay Bonus Agreements

In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Silver Spring entered into Cancellation and Stay Bonus Agreements
with certain of Silver Spring’s executive officers. Pursuant to such agreements, each such executive officer waived accelerated
vesting provisions relating to the PSUs granted in 2015 in consideration for a cash retention award that will be paid if the
executive remains continuously employed with us through the consummation of the merger. If an executive’s employment
terminates for any reason prior to the date on which the merger is consummated, such executive will not be entitled to the
retention award or the benefits of the waived provisions in respect of such PSUs.

Annual Cash Incentives

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the earlier of (i) the payroll date of the last regularly scheduled pay period of
the 2017 calendar year or (ii) the payroll date of the last regularly scheduled pay period prior to the closing of the merger, Silver
Spring may pay bonuses for Silver Spring’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 pursuant to Silver Spring’s annual incentive
plan as if the applicable performance targets were fully achieved at target levels.

Executive Officer Equity Acceleration and Severance

In connection with the merger, and pursuant to their employment agreements, termination benefit agreements, employment offer
letters and equity award agreements with Silver Spring, certain executive officers are entitled to receive accelerated vesting of
their equity awards and/or enhanced severance payments upon qualifying terminations of employment during a specified period
before and after the closing of the merger. Please see the section entitled “―Interests of Silver Spring’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” on page 58 of this proxy statement for additional information.

No Solicitation by Silver Spring of Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Board Recommendation (see page 89)

Pursuant to the merger agreement, subject to certain exceptions, Silver Spring has agreed that it will not (and will cause its
subsidiaries not to and use its reasonable best efforts to cause other representatives of Silver Spring and its subsidiaries not to),
directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate, seek, knowingly encourage, knowingly facilitate or knowingly induce the making, submission or
announcement of any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an acquisition proposal (as defined in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—No
Solicitation by Silver Spring of Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Board Recommendation” beginning on page 89 of
this proxy statement);

• enter into, participate in, maintain or continue any communications (except to notify such person or entity of the
restrictions of the non-solicitation provision contained in the merger agreement) or negotiations regarding, or deliver,
furnish or make available to any person any non-public information or afford any person or entity access to Silver
Spring’s non-public information, or the personnel of Silver Spring or any of its subsidiaries with respect to, or take any
other action regarding, any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal;

• agree to, accept, approve, adopt, endorse or recommend any acquisition proposal, or propose or announce any intention
to do any of the foregoing with respect to any acquisition proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

• enter into any letter of intent, term sheet, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding or other similar
document or agreement or any other contract contemplating or otherwise relating to, or that would reasonably be

• submit any acquisition proposal to the vote of any Silver Spring stockholders.

Prior to the date that the Silver Spring stockholders approve the merger proposal, if Silver Spring receives a bona fide, written
and unsolicited acquisition proposal from any person or entity, Silver Spring or its board of directors may, directly or indirectly
through Silver Spring representatives, participate in discussions or negotiations with such person or entity that made the bona
fide, written and unsolicited acquisition proposal and/or furnish to such person or entity any non-public information relating to
Silver Spring and its subsidiaries (provided that Silver Spring contemporaneously provides such non-public information to Itron
to the extent such information has not previously been furnished to Itron) and/or afford access to the business, properties, assets,
books, records or other non-public information, or the personnel of Silver Spring or any of its subsidiaries, in each case pursuant
to an “acceptable confidentiality agreement,” provided that Silver Spring did not receive such acquisition proposal as a result of a
breach of the non-solicitation provision contained in the merger agreement and, prior to taking such action:

• the Silver Spring board of directors determines in good faith: (i) after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal is, or is reasonably expected to lead to, a “superior proposal” (as defined in
the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—No Solicitation by Silver Spring of Acquisition Proposals;
Changes in Board Recommendation” beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement); and (ii) after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that its failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Silver Spring
stockholders under Delaware law; and

• Silver Spring provides to Itron: (i) written notice of the identity of such person or entity making such acquisition
proposal and of Silver Spring’s intention to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non-
public information to, such person or entity, and (ii) a copy of such acquisition proposal (unless such acquisition
proposal is not made in writing, in which case Silver Spring will provide the material terms of such acquisition
proposal).

Contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information relating to Silver Spring to any person in accordance with the
foregoing, Silver Spring shall furnish such non-public information to Itron, to the extent not previously provided to Itron.

For a further discussion of the limitations on solicitation of acquisition proposals, and exceptions to such limitations, see the
section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—No Solicitation by Silver Spring of Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Board
Recommendation” beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement.

Subject to the exceptions described below in this section, the Silver Spring board of directors has unanimously recommended that
Silver Spring stockholders vote in favor of the merger proposal, and Silver Spring has agreed that none of it, its board of directors
or any committee thereof will, and will not publicly propose to, (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner
adverse to Itron, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Itron, the
recommendation that Silver Spring stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger, (ii) approve, endorse or
recommend any acquisition proposal or (iii) fail to recommend against the acceptance of tender offer for shares of Silver Spring
common stock or exchange offer within ten business days after the commencement of such offer. The actions described in any of

only if (i) Silver Spring receives an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal (not received as a result of a breach of the
non-solicitation provisions contained in the merger agreement) that its board of directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal and determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that its failure to enter into a definitive agreement relating to
such superior proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Silver Spring stockholders under Delaware law or (ii) an
“intervening event” (as defined in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—No Solicitation by Silver Spring of
Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Board Recommendation” beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement) occurs and as a result
thereof the Silver Spring board of directors and/or any authorized committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action in light of such intervening event would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to Silver Spring stockholders under Delaware law; provided, that:

• prior to making a company board recommendation change with respect to a superior proposal:

• Silver Spring has notified Itron in writing of the superior proposal and that it intends to effect a company board
recommendation change;

• Silver Spring has provided Itron with the identity of the person or entity making such superior proposal and a copy
of all proposed definitive agreements (including financing agreements, if any) with respect to such superior
proposal, with any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such superior proposal requiring
Silver Spring to provide an additional notice to Itron;

• if requested by Itron, for a period of four business days after delivery of such notice, Silver Spring has discussed
and negotiated, and caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, in good faith (and Silver Spring has made
Silver Spring representatives available to discuss) with Itron and its representatives (to the extent Itron desires to
negotiate), any proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that such superior
proposal ceases to constitute a superior proposal; and

• the Silver Spring board of directors and/or any authorized committee thereof has determined in good faith, after
considering the terms of any written offer to modify the terms of the merger agreement made by Itron prior to the
expiration of the four business day period described in the immediately preceding bullet point that would, upon
acceptance by Silver Spring, be binding on Itron, that such superior proposal still constitutes a superior proposal,
and that the failure to make a company board recommendation change in connection therewith would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Silver Spring stockholders under Delaware law. The parties have agreed
that any change to the financial or other material terms of a proposal that is the subject of written notice described
in the third preceding bullet point above will require Silver Spring to provide a new notice to Itron and to again
comply with the requirements in this bullet point and the two immediately preceding bullet points, except that the
four business day notice period described in the immediately preceding bullet point will be shortened to two
business days following such new notice.

• prior to making a company board recommendation change with respect to an intervening event:

• Silver Spring has notified Itron in writing of such intervening event, including a reasonable description of the
intervening event and that it intends to make a company board recommendation change;

• if requested by Itron, for a period of four business days after delivery of such notice, Silver Spring has discussed

Silver Spring representatives available to discuss) with Itron and its representatives (to the extent Itron desires to

• the Silver Spring board of directors has determined in good faith, after considering the terms of any written offer
to modify the terms of the merger agreement made by Itron within the four business day period described in the
immediately preceding bullet point, that would, upon acceptance by Silver Spring thereof, be binding on Itron, that
the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Silver Spring stockholders
under Delaware law.

For a further discussion of the limitations on effecting a company board recommendation change, see the section entitled “Terms
of the Merger Agreement—No Solicitation by Silver Spring of Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Board Recommendation”
beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement.

Conditions to Consummation of the Merger (see page 97)

As more fully described in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Conditions to Consummation of the Merger”
beginning on page 97 of this proxy statement, each party’s obligation to consummate the merger is subject to the satisfaction or
waiver (where permissible) of the following conditions:

• Silver Spring has received the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of Silver
Spring common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting in favor of adopting the merger agreement, which approval
is in full force and effect at the effective time of the merger;

• any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
which we refer to as the “HSR Act,” has expired or otherwise been terminated;

• no governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has enacted, issued or promulgated any law or issued or granted
any order, in each case that is in effect and has the effect of making the merger illegal or which has the effect of
prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the merger, or that imposes a “burdensome condition” (as
defined in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Consents, Approvals and Filings” beginning on page
93 of this proxy statement), other than a non-U.S. antitrust law or any non-U.S. order issued under an antitrust law;

• the truth and accuracy of certain representations and warranties made by the other party in the merger agreement,
subject to the materiality standards set forth in the merger agreement;

• the other party’s performance or compliance in all material respects with all agreements and covenants required by the
merger agreement to be performed by it on or prior to the closing date of the merger;

• each party having received a certificate signed by an executive officer of the other party certifying as to the satisfaction
of the conditions regarding the representations and the obligations of such other party; and

• Silver Spring not having a material adverse effect since September 17, 2017.

Neither Itron nor Silver Spring can be certain of when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived, or that the
merger will be completed.

Termination; Effect of Termination (see page 99)

The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may
be abandoned at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before or after receipt of the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting in
favor of the merger proposal, in the following ways:

• by mutual written agreement of Itron and Silver Spring;

• by either Itron or Silver Spring if:

• the effective time of the merger has not occurred on or before March 17, 2018, which we refer to as the
“termination date,” provided that upon the request of either Itron or Silver Spring prior to such termination date
(including as it may be extended pursuant to this proviso) the termination date will be extended for all purposes
under the merger agreement until the date specified in such request that is not later than June 17, 2018; provided
that such right to terminate the merger

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• by Silver Spring if:

• at any time prior to obtaining the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of
Silver Spring common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement, the Silver Spring board of directors has effected a company board recommendation change, in
compliance with the merger agreement, to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of a
superior proposal (provided that Silver Spring has not violated in any material respect its non-solicitation
obligations under the merger agreement or the obligation of the board to make the company board
recommendation) (as discussed in section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—No Solicitation by Silver
Spring of Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Board Recommendation” beginning on page 89 of this proxy
statement); provided that Silver Spring pays Itron a termination fee of $32.3 million and enters into a binding
definitive agreement with respect to such superior proposal;

• the representations or warranties of Itron or Merger Sub have become inaccurate or breached, or Itron or Merger
Sub has breached any of their covenants or obligations set forth in the merger agreement, in either case in a
manner that would give rise to the failure of the corresponding closing condition to be satisfied, and either (i) such
breach is incapable of being cured by the termination date or (ii) if capable of being cured by the termination date,
Itron and/or Merger Sub have failed to cure such breach within 20 business days after Silver Spring has notified
Itron or Merger Sub of such breach (except Silver Spring may not exercise this termination right if it is then in
material breach of the merger agreement); or

• after the conditions to Itron’s obligations to effect the merger have been fulfilled (or are capable of being fulfilled
at the closing), Silver Spring has confirmed to Itron and Merger Sub in writing that it is ready and able to
consummate the merger and Itron and Merger Sub have failed (due to the failure of the financing to have timely
occurred in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement) to consummate the merger within 20 business
days following the date the closing should have occurred (except Silver Spring may not exercise this termination
right if it is then in material breach of the merger agreement and until 24 hours after expiration of such 20 business
day period).

See the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Termination; Effect of Termination” beginning on page 99 of this
proxy statement.

If the merger agreement is validly terminated pursuant to the termination rights described above, the merger agreement will
become void and of no further force or effect and there will be no liability or obligation on the part of any party, except for the
confidentiality provisions, provisions relating to the effect of termination and fees and expenses (including the termination fees
described in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Termination Fee” beginning on page 101 of this proxy
statement) and certain other specified general provisions of the merger agreement, each of which will survive the termination of
the merger agreement. The parties have further agreed that nothing in the merger agreement, including the termination of the
merger agreement, will relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of the merger agreement prior to the date of its
termination, in which case the non-breaching party will be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity.

Termination Fee (see page 101)

Under the merger agreement, Silver Spring is required to pay Itron a termination fee of $32.3 million in cash, which we refer to
as the “termination fee,” if the merger agreement is terminated under the circumstances set forth in the merger agreement, which
are specified in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Termination Fee” beginning on page 101 of this proxy
statement, including if Silver Spring terminates the merger agreement prior to the adoption of the merger agreement and approval
of the merger by Silver Spring stockholders and the Silver Spring board of directors determines to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a superior proposal in accordance with the non-solicitation provision contained in the merger
agreement. In no event will Silver Spring be required to pay the termination fee in connection with the termination of the merger
agreement on more than one occasion. The parties have agreed that, in the event the merger agreement is terminated under
circumstances where the termination fee would be payable, the payment of the termination fee to Itron, in accordance with the
terms of the merger agreement, will be Itron’s sole and

exclusive remedy for any loss it or Merger Sub suffers as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement to be consummated, the termination of the merger agreement, any liabilities or obligations arising under the merger
agreement or any claims or actions arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of or under the merger
agreement, except that there is no limit to liability for any losses resulting from fraud or willful breach of the merger agreement
by Silver Spring, as described above in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Termination; Effect of Termination”
beginning on page 99 of this proxy statement.

Fees and Expenses (see page 102)

All out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing sources,
hedging counterparties, experts and consultants) incurred in connection with the merger agreement, the transactions contemplated
thereby, the solicitation of stockholder approvals and all other matters related to the consummation of the merger will be paid by
the party or parties, as applicable, incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are consummated, with certain exceptions expressly set forth in the merger agreement.
Silver Spring and Itron have agreed to pay one-half of the filing fees and the costs of filings made pursuant to antitrust laws and
of printing and mailing this proxy statement.

Regulatory Approvals (see page 65)

The HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder require that Silver Spring and Itron file notification and
report forms with respect to the merger with the U.S. Department of Justice, which we refer to as the “DOJ,” and the Federal
Trade Commission, which we refer to as the “FTC,” and observe a waiting period before consummating the merger. The required
notification and report forms under the HSR Act have been filed with the DOJ and the FTC by Silver Spring and Itron.

At any time before or after the consummation of the merger, the DOJ, the FTC, a U.S. state or a foreign governmental authority
with jurisdiction over the parties could take such action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public
interest, including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the merger, to rescind the merger or to seek divestiture of particular
assets. Private parties also may seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

Delisting and Deregistration of Silver Spring Common Stock (see page 66)

Silver Spring common stock is registered as a class of equity securities under the Exchange Act and is quoted on the NYSE under
the symbol “SSNI.” As a result of the merger, Silver Spring will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Itron, shares of Silver
Spring common stock will no longer be publicly traded on the NYSE and price quotations with respect to sales of shares of Silver
Spring common stock in the public market will no longer be available. In addition, Silver Spring will no longer be required to file
periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the “SEC,” after the effective time of the
merger with respect to shares of Silver Spring common stock.

Consequences if the Merger is Not Consummated (see page 66)

If Silver Spring stockholders do not approve the merger proposal, or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason,
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Silver Spring common stock in connection with the merger. Instead,
shares of Silver Spring common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and Silver Spring will continue to file
periodic reports with the SEC. In certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee, or we or Itron may seek
damages or other remedies, in each case, as described under the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Termination;
Effect of Termination” and “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Termination Fee” beginning on page 99 and page 101, respectively,
of this proxy statement.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 66)

The receipt of cash for shares of Silver Spring common stock in the merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if you are a U.S. holder (as defined in the section
entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and Approval of the

Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 66 of this proxy statement), you will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received for your shares of Silver Spring
common stock surrendered pursuant to the merger and your adjusted tax basis in such shares. If you are a non-U.S. holder (as
defined in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and Approval of the Merger—U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 66 of this proxy statement), the receipt of cash pursuant to the merger will
generally not be a taxable transaction to you under U.S. federal income tax laws unless you have certain connections to the
United States, and you are encouraged to seek tax advice regarding such matters. You should read the section entitled “Proposal
1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and Approval of the Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”
beginning on page 66 of this proxy statement and consult your own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger to you in light of your particular circumstances and because U.S. federal tax laws are subject to
change (possibly with retroactive effect), as well as tax consequences arising under any state, local or foreign tax laws or non-
income tax laws.

Market Price of Silver Spring Common Stock and Dividend Information (see page 107)

Silver Spring common stock is listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol “SSNI.” The closing price of Silver Spring common
stock on the NYSE on September 15, 2017, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger, was $13.00 and
the merger consideration represents a premium of 25% over the closing price on September 15, 2017. On November 14, 2017, the
most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was mailed to our stockholders, the closing price of Silver Spring
common stock on the NYSE was $16.09.

Silver Spring has never declared or paid any cash dividends on Silver Spring common stock. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, we may not declare, authorize, make or pay any dividend or other distribution on Silver Spring common stock during
the pendency of the merger.

Appraisal Rights (see page 104)

If the merger is consummated, Silver Spring stockholders who do not vote in favor of the merger proposal, who continuously
hold such shares through the effective time of the merger, who properly exercise and perfect appraisal rights in respect of their
shares of Silver Spring common stock, and who meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements described herein will be
entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. Due to the complexity of the appraisal
process, Silver Spring stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel
with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.

Silver Spring stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they
would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to Silver Spring before the vote is taken on
the merger proposal, (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the merger proposal, and (3) continue to hold your shares of
Silver Spring common stock of record through the effective time of the merger. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures
specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights
are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is
reproduced and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of Silver Spring common stock through a
broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker, bank, or other
nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by such broker, bank or
other nominee.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

This proxy statement contains certain “forward-looking” statements as such term is defined by Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, which we refer to as the “Securities Act,” and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements
may be typically identified by such words as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “likely,” “believe,” “estimate,”
“project,” “intend” and other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and
uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking
statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, any or all of our
forward-looking statements may prove to be incorrect. Consequently, no forward-looking statements may be guaranteed, and there
can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by such forward-looking statements will be realized or, even
if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, Silver Spring or its business or operations.
Factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those projected or contemplated in any such forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to, the following:

• the risk that the conditions to the closing of the merger are not satisfied (including a failure of the Silver Spring
stockholders to, on a timely basis or otherwise, adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger, and the risk that
regulatory approvals required for the merger are not obtained, on a timely basis or otherwise, or are obtained subject to
conditions that are not anticipated);

• the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay Itron a termination fee of
$32.3 million in connection therewith;

• litigation relating to the merger;

• uncertainties as to the timing of the consummation of the merger and the ability of each of Silver Spring and Itron to
consummate the merger;

• risks that the proposed transaction diverts management’s attention from our ongoing business operations and disrupts the
current plans and operations of Silver Spring;

• the ability of Silver Spring to retain and hire key personnel;

• competitive responses to the merger;

• limitations in the merger agreement on our ability to operate our business;

• unexpected costs, charges or expenses that we incur related to the merger;

• the risk that our financial results differ from those set forth in the projections described in this proxy statement;

• potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or consummation of the
merger; and

• legislative, regulatory and economic developments.

The foregoing factors that could cause actual events to differ from expectations should not be construed as exhaustive and should be
read in conjunction with statements that are included herein and elsewhere, including the risk factors included in our most recent
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2017, and our other reports filed with the SEC. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking
statements concerning the proposed transaction or other matters attributable to Silver Spring or any other person acting on its behalf
are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referenced above. None of Silver Spring, Itron or any other
person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. You should not rely
upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the
communication in which they are contained. Silver Spring can give no assurance that the conditions to the merger will be satisfied.
Except as required by applicable law, Silver Spring undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement, or
to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

All information contained in this proxy statement exclusively concerning Itron and Merger Sub and their affiliates has been supplied

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SPECIAL MEETING

This section contains information about the special meeting of the Silver Spring stockholders that has been called to consider and
vote upon the merger proposal and to consider and vote upon the adjournment proposal.

This proxy statement is being provided to the Silver Spring stockholders as part of a solicitation of proxies by the Silver Spring
board of directors for use at the special meeting to be held on the date and at the time and place specified below, and at any
properly convened meeting following an adjournment or postponement thereof, for the purposes set forth in this proxy statement and
in the accompanying notice of special meeting.

Date, Time and Place

A special meeting of the Silver Spring stockholders is scheduled to be held on January 3, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. (Pacific Time), at
Silver Spring’s offices located at 230 W. Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134 unless the special meeting is adjourned or
postponed.

This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to our stockholders on or about November 16, 2017.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, stockholders will be asked:

• to consider and vote upon the merger proposal, which provides for Merger Sub to merge with and into Silver Spring, with
Silver Spring continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Itron; and

• to consider and vote upon the adjournment proposal.

Recommendations of the Silver Spring Board of Directors

The Silver Spring board of directors, after carefully considering all factors that the Silver Spring board of directors deemed relevant
and after consulting with its legal and financial advisors, unanimously (i) determined that the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the merger, were fair to, and in the best interests of, Silver Spring and its stockholders, (ii) declared
advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, (iii) approved and authorized the
execution and delivery by Silver Spring of the merger agreement, the performance by Silver Spring of its covenants and agreements
contained therein, and the consummation of the merger and the transactions contemplated thereby, (iv) resolved to recommend that
Silver Spring stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger, all upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, and (v) to the extent permitted by applicable law, elected that any “fair
price,” “moratorium,” “control share acquisition,” “business combination,” or other anti-takeover statute or similar statute or
regulations of any jurisdiction that purports to be applicable to the merger, Silver Spring, the shares of Silver Spring common stock,
or the other transactions contemplated by the merger, shall not be applicable to the merger, Silver Spring, the shares of Silver Spring
common stock, or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Certain factors considered by the Silver Spring
board of directors in reaching these decisions can be found in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement
and Approval of the Merger—Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 42 of this proxy statement.

The Silver Spring board of directors unanimously recommends that Silver Spring stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of
the merger proposal. The Silver Spring board of directors also recommends that Silver Spring stockholders vote “FOR” the
approval of the adjournment proposal.

Record Date and Voting Information

Only stockholders who hold shares of Silver Spring common stock at the close of business on November 9, 2017, the record date for
the special meeting, will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any adjournments or postponements thereof.
Each stockholder of record on the record date will be entitled to one vote for each share of Silver Spring common stock held as of
the record date on each matter properly brought before the special meeting. If you sell or transfer your shares of Silver Spring
common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are
made between

TABLE OF CONTENTS

you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Silver Spring common stock, and each of you notifies
Silver Spring of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share merger consideration, if the merger is
consummated, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of Silver Spring common stock, but you will retain your right
to vote such shares of Silver Spring common stock at the special meeting.

As of the close of business on the record date, there were 54,142,118 shares of Silver Spring common stock, issued, outstanding and
entitled to vote at the special meeting, which shares of Silver Spring common stock were held by approximately 101 stockholders of
record.

Brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of Silver Spring common stock for clients typically have the authority to vote on
“routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. Absent specific instructions from the
beneficial owner of the shares of Silver Spring common stock, however, brokers, banks or other nominees are not allowed to
exercise their voting discretion with respect to the approval of non-routine matters. The merger proposal in this proxy statement is a
non-routine matter, and therefore brokers, banks and other nominees cannot vote on the merger proposal without your instructions.
Proxies submitted without a vote by brokers, banks or other nominees on this matter are referred to as “broker non-votes” and are
discussed in greater detail in the section entitled “—Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes” beginning on page 27 of this proxy
statement.

Quorum

At the special meeting, the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Silver Spring
common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting is necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of any
business at such meeting. As of the record date for the special meeting, there were 54,142,118 shares of Silver Spring common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Accordingly, 27,071,060 shares of Silver Spring common stock must be
represented by stockholders entitled to vote to constitute a quorum for the special meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are
considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. In the event that a quorum is not present, or if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger at the time of the special meeting, we expect that the
meeting will be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

Attendance

Only Silver Spring stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date, their duly authorized proxy holders,
beneficial owners with proof of ownership and guests of Silver Spring may attend the special meeting. If your shares of Silver
Spring common stock are held through a broker, bank, or other nominee and you plan to attend the special meeting in person, you
must bring a brokerage statement, the proxy card mailed to you by your bank or broker or other proof of ownership to be admitted
to the special meeting. Additionally, any person attending the special meeting in person will be required to present valid,
government-issued photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport, to be admitted to the special meeting. Please note that
cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the special meeting. In addition, packages and bags
may be inspected and other measures may be employed to enhance the security of persons attending the special meeting. These
procedures may require additional time, so please plan your arrival time accordingly. To avoid disruption, admission may be limited
once the special meeting begins.

Required Vote

Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock
entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal by the
stockholders present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote (assuming the presence of a quorum at the
special meeting).

If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed for any reason, and the record date remains unchanged, at any subsequent
reconvening of the special meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original
convening of the meeting, except for any proxies that have been revoked or withdrawn.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

It is important that you vote your shares of Silver Spring common stock. Under the DGCL, the approval of the merger proposal
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock that are entitled to vote thereon.
Accordingly, your abstention will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal. The adjournment proposal
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast thereon, and therefore, your abstention will not have an effect on, the
adjournment proposal.

If you hold your shares of Silver Spring common stock in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, such broker, bank or other
nominee may vote your shares of Silver Spring common stock on the merger proposal only if you provide instructions on how to
vote. Your failure to provide instructions will result in your shares of Silver Spring common stock not being voted on the merger
proposal. This is called a “broker non-vote.” Broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal
and will have no effect on the adjournment proposal.

Voting by Stockholders

After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, you should vote according to the
instructions described below.

If your shares of Silver Spring common stock are held in your name by Silver Spring’s transfer agent, Computershare, you can vote:

• Via the Internet. If you choose to vote via the Internet, sign on to the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card and
follow the instructions for voting your shares. You will need the control number shown on your proxy card in order to
vote.

• Via Telephone. If you choose to vote via telephone, use a touch-tone telephone to call the phone number indicated on the
enclosed proxy card and follow the voice prompts. You will need the control number shown on your proxy card in order to
vote.

• Via Mail. If you choose to vote via mail, simply mark, date, sign and return your proxy card in the postage-paid envelope
provided. Proxy cards that are returned without a signature will not be counted as present at the special meeting and
cannot be voted.

• At the Special Meeting. You may attend and vote in person at the special meeting. Any previously submitted proxies will
be superseded by the vote you cast in person at the special meeting.

Please do not send in stock certificates or other documents representing Silver Spring common stock at this time. If the
merger is consummated, holders of Silver Spring common stock certificates will receive instructions regarding the
procedures for exchanging their existing Silver Spring common stock certificates for the payment of the merger
consideration.

If you are a beneficial owner and your shares of Silver Spring common stock are held in the name of a broker, bank or other
nominee, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Silver Spring common
stock. Because a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote such shares of Silver Spring common stock at
the special meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares of Silver Spring
common stock giving you the right to vote such shares of Silver Spring common stock at the special meeting.

Proxies received at any time before the special meeting and not expired, revoked or superseded before being voted will be voted at
the special meeting. If the proxy indicates a specification, it will be voted in accordance with the specification. If no specification is
indicated, the proxy will be voted “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger and “FOR” the approval
of the adjournment proposal.

Revocation of Proxies

Stockholders of record retain the power to revoke their proxy or change their vote, even if they sign the proxy card or voting
instruction card in the form accompanying this proxy statement, via the Internet or via telephone. Stockholders of record can revoke
their proxy or change their vote at any time before it is exercised by delivering written notice to Silver Spring at 230 W. Tasman
Drive, San Jose, California 95134, Attn: General Counsel, specifying such revocation. Stockholders of record may also change their
vote by timely delivery of a

valid, later-dated proxy or by voting by ballot in person at the special meeting. Simply attending the special meeting will not
constitute revocation of your proxy. If your shares of Silver Spring common stock are held in the name of a broker, bank or other
nominee, you should follow the instructions of such broker, bank or other nominee regarding the revocation of proxies. If you have
voted via the Internet or via telephone, you may change your vote by signing on to the website and following the prompts or calling
the toll-free number again and following the instructions.

Voting by Silver Spring’s Directors and Executive Officers

As of the record date for the special meeting, our directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned and were
entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 12,089,654 shares of Silver Spring common stock at the special meeting, representing
approximately 22.3% of the outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock as of the record date. We currently expect that Silver
Spring’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares of Silver Spring common stock in favor of the merger proposal.

Warren Weiss, one of our directors, and certain stockholders affiliated with Mr. Weiss, entered into a voting agreement with Itron as
described in the section entitled “Terms of the Voting Agreement” beginning on page 104 of this proxy statement. As of the close of
business on the record date for the special meeting, Silver Spring stockholders subject to the voting agreement beneficially owned
and were entitled to vote approximately 19.5% of the outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock. A copy of the voting
agreement is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement.

Certain directors and executive officers of Silver Spring have interests that are different from, or in addition to, those of other Silver
Spring stockholders generally. For more information, see the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and
Approval of the Merger—Interests of Silver Spring’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 58 of this
proxy statement.

Expenses of Proxy Solicitation

This proxy statement is being furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Silver Spring board of directors. We
have engaged the services of Innisfree M&A Incorporated, or Innisfree, to solicit proxies for the special meeting. In connection with
its retention by us, Innisfree has agreed to provide proxy solicitation services, strategic advice and consulting and distribution
services in connection with the special meeting. We have agreed to pay Innnisfree a fee equal to $15,000 plus reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses for its services. We have agreed to indemnify Innisfree for certain losses arising out of its proxy solicitation
services. Expenses incurred in connection with printing and mailing of this proxy statement will be paid one-half by Silver Spring
and one-half by Itron. Copies of solicitation materials will also be furnished to banks, brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians
holding in their names shares of Silver Spring common stock beneficially owned by others to forward to such beneficial owners. We
may reimburse persons representing beneficial owners of Silver Spring common stock for their costs of forwarding solicitation
materials to the beneficial owners. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, solicitation may be made personally, by
telephone, by e-mail and by fax, and we may pay persons holding shares of Silver Spring common stock for their expenses for
sending proxy materials to their principals. In addition to solicitation by the use of mail, proxies may be solicited by our directors,
officers and employees in person or by telephone, e-mail or other means of communication. No additional compensation will be
paid to our directors, officers or employees for their services.

Householding

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, banks or other nominees, to satisfy the
delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by
delivering a single annual report or proxy statement, as applicable, addressed to such stockholders. This process, commonly referred
to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. Silver Spring and
some brokers, banks or other nominees may be householding Silver Spring’s proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy
materials to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders.
Once you have received notice from your broker, bank or other nominee, or from Silver Spring that your broker, bank or other
nominee, or Silver Spring will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified
otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If at any time you

TABLE OF CONTENTS

no longer wish to participate in householding, and prefer to receive a separate proxy statement or annual report, or if you are
receiving multiple copies of either document and wish to receive only one, please notify your broker, bank or other nominee, if your
shares of Silver Spring common stock are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, or Silver Spring, if you are a
stockholder of record. You can notify Silver Spring by sending a written request to our Investor Relations team at Silver Spring, 230
W. Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134. In addition, we will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or
telephone number above, a separate copy of this proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the
documents was delivered.

Tabulation of Votes

All votes will be tabulated by a representative of the Veaco Group, which will act as the Inspector of Elections and will separately
tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes.

Adjournments and Postponements

In addition to the merger proposal, Silver Spring stockholders are also being asked to approve a proposal that will give the Silver
Spring board of directors authority to adjourn the special meeting if necessary or appropriate in the view of the Silver Spring board
of directors, including to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the
merger agreement and approve the merger, to allow for the filing and distribution of any required supplemental or amended
disclosure to Silver Spring stockholders prior to the special meeting, or otherwise with the consent, or upon the request, of Itron. In
addition, the Silver Spring board of directors could postpone the meeting before it commences, in each case in any of the
circumstances described above. If the special meeting is so adjourned or postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies,
stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. If you return a
proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the merger
proposal, but do not indicate a choice on the adjournment proposal, your shares of Silver Spring common stock will be voted in
favor of the adjournment proposal.

Any adjournment may be made without notice to another time or place if the date, time and place to which the meeting is adjourned
is announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting any business may be transacted that might
have been transacted on the original date of the meeting. If the Silver Spring board of directors fixes a new record date for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned
meeting.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT
AND APPROVAL OF THE MERGER

Effects of the Merger

If the merger proposal receives the affirmative vote of stockholders holding more than a majority of all outstanding shares of Silver
Spring common stock entitled to vote on such matter and the other conditions to the consummation of the merger are either satisfied
or (to the extent permitted by the merger agreement and applicable law) waived, at the effective time of the merger Merger Sub will
merge with and into Silver Spring upon the terms set forth in the merger agreement. As a result of the merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will cease to exist with Silver Spring continuing as the surviving corporation of the merger and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Itron.

Following the merger, Silver Spring will be wholly owned by Itron, and none of Silver Spring’s current stockholders will, by virtue
of the merger, have any ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, Silver Spring, the surviving corporation or Itron after the
consummation of the merger. As a result, Silver Spring’s current stockholders will no longer benefit from any increase in the value,
nor will they bear the risk of any decrease in the value, of shares of Silver Spring common stock. Following the merger, Itron will
benefit from any increase in Silver Spring’s value and also will bear the risk of any decrease in Silver Spring’s value.

Upon consummation of the merger, each share of Silver Spring common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration. See the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Terms of the Merger; Merger Consideration” beginning on
page 76 of this proxy statement.

For information regarding the effects of the merger on Silver Spring’s outstanding equity awards, please see the sections entitled
“Terms of the Merger Agreement—Treatment of Equity Awards” and “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Treatment of 2012 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan” beginning on page 77 and page 78, respectively, of this proxy statement.

Silver Spring common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and trades on the NYSE under the symbol “SSNI.”
Following the consummation of the merger, shares of Silver Spring common stock will no longer be traded on the NYSE or any
other public market. In addition, the registration of shares of Silver Spring common stock under the Exchange Act will be
terminated, and Silver Spring will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC with respect to shares of
Silver Spring common stock. Termination of registration of shares of Silver Spring common stock under the Exchange Act will
reduce the information required to be furnished by Silver Spring to Silver Spring stockholders and the SEC, and would make certain
provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the requirement to file annual and quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy
statement in connection with stockholders’ meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, no longer applicable to Silver
Spring.

Background of the Merger

The Silver Spring board periodically reviews and assesses Silver Spring’s long-term strategies and objectives and developments in
the markets in which Silver Spring operates, including, among other things, strategies to improve its business and operations
through potential strategic alliances and collaborations, acquisitions of other companies and businesses, divestitures of Silver
Spring’s assets or businesses, and other strategic alternatives. In addition, Silver Spring senior management meets from time to time
with representatives of other companies to discuss their respective businesses and explore opportunities for potential commercial
and strategic transactions. In connection with these reviews and assessments, the Silver Spring board and members of Silver Spring
senior management may enlist the assistance of financial advisors and outside legal advisors.

On January 20, 2017, and again on January 23, 2017, a representative of an investment bank contacted Scott Lang, Executive
Chairman and Chairman of the Silver Spring board to discuss, among other things, the advanced metering business sector and
potential strategic transactions, including a potential sale of Silver Spring to Itron.

On January 27, 2017, the independent members of the Silver Spring board held a meeting to discuss potential strategic alternatives
for Silver Spring. A representative of Silver Spring’s outside legal counsel, Fenwick & West LLP, which we refer to as Fenwick in
this proxy statement, was present at the meeting. During the meeting, the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

independent members of the Silver Spring board reviewed and discussed strategic opportunities for Silver Spring, including a
potential sale of the company. Peter Van Camp, Silver Spring’s lead independent director, also discussed the unsolicited contact of
Mr. Lang by an investment bank on January 20 and January 23. Each of the independent members stated his or her preliminary
views with respect to Silver Spring remaining as a standalone company and the potential opportunities for a sale of the company.
The independent members discussed, among other things, the trends in Silver Spring’s historical smart grid and smart city
businesses and Silver Spring’s progress in developing technology assets for the Internet of Things business, which we refer to as the
IoT in this proxy statement. Following discussion, Mr. Van Camp recommended to the other independent members that Silver
Spring engage a financial advisor to conduct a market check process to assess the interest of potential buyers. The independent
members recommended that the Silver Spring board establish a committee of directors consisting of Messrs. Van Camp, Schwartz
and Werner, which we refer to as the Strategy Committee or the Committee in this proxy statement, to oversee the market check
process between meetings of the full Silver Spring board, and to make a recommendation with respect to the appointment of a
financial advisor to assist with a market check process.

On February 3, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, during which the Committee members discussed strategic alternatives
for Silver Spring, including the appropriate parameters of a market check of potential buyers and the engagement of a financial
advisor to assist with the market check.

On February 8, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, during which the Committee members continued to discuss the
proposed market check.

On February 12, 2017, a representative of Itron’s financial advisor, Centerview Partners LLC, which we refer to as Centerview in
this proxy statement, contacted Richard Simonson, a member of the Silver Spring board, regarding Itron’s interest in a potential
business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

On February 13, 2017, Philip Mezey, Itron’s Chief Executive Officer, contacted Mr. Van Camp to discuss Itron’s interest in a
potential business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

On February 16, 2017, the Silver Spring board held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and a representative of
Fenwick present, during which the board discussed, among other things, the call between Mr. Van Camp and Mr. Mezey. Michael
Bell, Silver Spring’s President and Chief Executive Officer, also discussed potential strategic partnerships that Silver Spring was
pursuing with two public companies, and suggested that each of these parties might also be interested in acquiring Silver Spring and
should be considered among the company’s strategic alternatives (the first public company, together with its affiliate, we refer to
collectively as Party A in this proxy statement, and the second public company we refer to as Party B in this proxy statement). After
discussion of these and other strategic alternatives, the Silver Spring board determined to engage a financial advisor to advise Silver
Spring on its response to Itron, and to potentially conduct a market check to determine the level of interest of third parties in
acquiring Silver Spring. The Silver Spring board further discussed the possible appropriate parameters of a proposed market check,
and which investment banks should be considered for engagement. After discussion, Mr. Van Camp suggested that Evercore Group
L.L.C., which we refer to as Evercore in this proxy statement, be considered to be engaged as Silver Spring’s financial advisor due
to Evercore’s qualifications, experience, reputation and knowledge of the industry in which Silver Spring operates, and Evercore’s
experience in similar situations. The Silver Spring board requested that Mr. Van Camp introduce his contacts at Evercore to
representatives of Silver Spring senior management.

On February 20, 2017, Mr. Mezey contacted Mr. Van Camp to discuss Itron’s interest in an acquisition of Silver Spring. Later that
same day, Mr. Mezey and Tom Deitrich, Itron’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, contacted Mr. Van Camp to
request a meeting on March 10, 2017 to discuss publicly-available business and financial information regarding Silver Spring.

On March 2, 2017, Mr. Bell met with a representative of Party A, during which the representative of Party A indicated that Party A
might be interested in a potential business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

On March 10, 2017 and on April 12, 2017, Messrs. Bell, Van Camp and Mr. Lang met with members of Itron senior management to
discuss publicly-available business and financial information regarding Silver Spring and a potential acquisition of Silver Spring by
Itron.

On April 17, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of Evercore
present, during which the Committee discussed the meetings with representatives of

Itron and Messrs. Bell, Lang and Van Camp that occurred on March 10, 2017 and April 12, 2017. Also during the meeting, a
representative of Evercore made a presentation to the Committee regarding Evercore’s preliminary review of a draft of certain non-
public projected financial data relating to Silver Spring under business assumptions prepared by Silver Spring senior management at
the direction of the Strategy Committee, which we refer to as the management case forecasts as defined and described below under
the section titled “Certain Prospective Financial Information Reviewed by the Silver Spring Board of Directors and Silver Spring’s
Financial Advisor”, and Evercore’s preliminary perspective on Silver Spring’s valuation and the methods that could be used to value
Silver Spring. Evercore also provided an overview of Itron’s financial performance, financial resources and stock performance, and
outlined a potential plan to conduct a market check of other potential acquirers.

On April 18, 2017, the Silver Spring board held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of each of
Evercore and Fenwick present. During the meeting, representatives of Evercore reviewed the materials that had been presented to
the Strategy Committee the previous day, including the conversations that had occurred with representatives of Itron, Evercore’s
preliminary review of a draft of the management case forecasts, Evercore’s preliminary perspective on Silver Spring’s valuation and
Evercore’s proposal to conduct a market check of other potential acquirers.

During late April and early May 2017, Evercore conducted its initial outreach to 22 potential strategic bidders, including Party A
and Party B, regarding their interest in a potential business combination transaction with Silver Spring. The parties in Evercore’s
initial outreach were selected at the direction of the Silver Spring board, based on the likelihood that such parties would have a
strategic interest in, and financial ability to complete, a business combination with Silver Spring. During this same period, 12 of
such parties, including Party A, indicated that they had no interest in pursuing a business combination transaction with Silver
Spring, and three of such parties, including Party B, did not engage after outreach efforts by Evercore.

On April 25, 2017, Mr. Mezey contacted Mr. Van Camp to discuss a possible acquisition of Silver Spring by Itron, and to inform
him that Itron would be submitting a proposal to acquire Silver Spring. Later that day, a representative of Itron delivered to Mr. Van
Camp a non-binding proposal to acquire all of Silver Spring’s outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis at a price between
$15.00 and $16.00 per share in cash. The proposal also requested that Silver Spring enter into an exclusivity agreement providing
for a 30-day exclusivity period during which Itron would conduct due diligence and Itron and Silver Spring would negotiate
definitive agreements. In addition to the proposal letter, Itron delivered an executed letter from Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, which
we refer to as Wells Fargo in this proxy statement, in which Wells Fargo indicated that it was highly confident that funded debt
financing of up to $1.1 billion could be arranged for Itron’s proposed acquisition of Silver Spring.

Also on April 25, 2017, and again on April 27, 2017, representatives of Evercore discussed with a representative of a public
company (which we refer to as Party C in this proxy statement) that had responded to Evercore’s initial outreach, regarding Party
C’s interest in a potential business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

On April 26, 2017, the Silver Spring board held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of each of
Evercore and Fenwick present, during which the board discussed, among other things, Mr. Van Camp’s conversation with Mr.
Mezey and Itron’s April 25 proposal. Also during the meeting, Evercore made a presentation to the board regarding Itron’s April 25
proposal and request for exclusivity, the Wells Fargo letter and potential tactics and strategies with respect to responding to Itron.
After the Evercore presentation, the board, senior management and representatives of Evercore discussed the market check process,
including which third parties would be most likely to submit a competitive bid in the process, and the plan to arrange a meeting
between Silver Spring senior management and Itron senior management, during which Silver Spring senior management would
provide an overview of, and answer questions regarding, Silver Spring’s business. After the Evercore presentation and related
discussions concluded, a representative of Fenwick discussed with the Silver Spring board, among other things, its fiduciary duties
under Delaware law with respect to considering a potential sale of Silver Spring.

Later on April 26, 2017, Evercore, at the request of Silver Spring senior management, provided Silver Spring with a proposed
engagement letter for Evercore to act as Silver Spring’s financial advisor with respect to potential strategic transactions, including a
possible sale of Silver Spring. Over the course of the following months, Silver Spring and Evercore negotiated the terms of the
engagement letter.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On April 27, 2017, Mr. Van Camp, on behalf of the Strategy Committee, contacted Mr. Mezey and suggested that Silver Spring and
Itron enter into a confidentiality agreement, and arrange a meeting between Silver Spring senior management and Itron senior
management, during which Silver Spring senior management would provide an overview of, and answer questions regarding, Silver
Spring’s business.

On April 28, 2017, Mr. Van Camp provided Mr. Mezey a proposed confidentiality agreement between Silver Spring and Itron that
had been prepared by Fenwick. The confidentiality agreement included a “standstill” provision which generally prohibited Itron
from making public proposals to acquire Silver Spring, acquiring Silver Spring securities or taking similar actions (but permitted
Itron to make private, non-public proposals to the lead independent director on the Silver Spring board), and which provided that the
standstill provision would no longer apply following any of the execution by Silver Spring of a definitive acquisition agreement
with another party or the commencement of a tender offer for 40% or more of Silver Spring’s outstanding voting power. The
confidentiality agreement also included a non-solicit provision, which generally prohibited Itron from soliciting Silver Spring’s
employees. The confidentiality agreement with Itron did not include an exclusivity period.

Also on April 28, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting during which the Committee members discussed the market check
process and the formal engagement of Evercore as Silver Spring’s financial advisor.

Also on April 28, 2017, representatives of Evercore contacted representatives of a public company (which we refer to as Party D in
this proxy statement) that had responded to Evercore’s initial outreach regarding Party D’s potential interest in a potential business
combination transaction with Silver Spring. The representative of Party D indicated that Party D would not agree to enter into a
confidentiality agreement, but that Party D was interested in a meeting with Silver Spring senior management, during which Silver
Spring senior management would provide an overview of, and answer questions regarding, Silver Spring’s business.

On May 2, 2017, Itron provided its suggested revisions to Silver Spring’s proposed confidentiality agreement.

Between May 2, 2017 and May 8, 2017, representatives of Fenwick and Jones Day, Itron’s outside legal counsel, negotiated the
terms of the confidentiality agreement.

Between May 2, 2017 and May 22, 2017, representatives of Evercore held discussions with four separate public companies (which
we refer to as Party E, Party F, Party G and Party H, respectively, in this proxy statement) that had responded to Evercore’s initial
outreach, regarding such companies’ potential interest in a potential business combination transaction with Silver Spring. Also
during this time, each of Party C, Party E, Party F, Party G and Party H were provided, and later entered into, a confidentiality
agreement with Silver Spring. The confidentiality agreements with Party E and Party F included a standstill provision similar to the
standstill provision included in the confidentiality agreement with Itron. The confidentiality agreements with Party C, Party E and
Party H did not include any standstill provision because none of such parties would enter into a confidentiality agreement that
included a standstill provision, and Silver Spring senior management, after discussion with representatives of Fenwick, determined
that the benefit of including such parties in the potential sale process outweighed the risk that such parties would propose a
transaction directly to Silver Spring’s stockholders. None of the confidentiality agreements with Party C, Party E, Party F, Party G
or Party H included an exclusivity provision restricting Silver Spring’s ability to discuss a potential transaction with other parties.

On May 2, 2017, Silver Spring senior management held a meeting with representatives of Party D, during which Silver Spring
senior management provided an overview of, and answered questions regarding, Silver Spring’s business.

On May 5, 2017, Party D indicated that it was not interested in pursuing a business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

On May 8, 2017, Silver Spring and Itron entered into a confidentiality agreement, which included the standstill provision described
above but did not include any exclusivity provision restricting Silver Spring’s ability to discuss a potential transaction with other
parties. Later that same day, members of Silver Spring senior management met with representatives of Itron to provide an overview
of, and answer questions regarding, Silver Spring’s business. During the meeting, Silver Spring senior management provided the
Itron representatives with a summary of the management case forecasts through December 31, 2020. Representatives of Itron
continued to conduct due diligence in the following weeks, requesting additional information from Silver Spring and conducting
follow-up diligence calls with Silver Spring senior management.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Between May 10, 2017 and May 24, 2017, members of Silver Spring senior management also met with representatives of each of
Party C, Party E, Party F, Party G and Party H to provide such parties an overview of, and answer questions regarding, Silver
Spring’s business. During such meetings, Silver Spring senior management provided each such party with a summary of the
management case forecasts through December 31, 2020.

On May 24, 2017, at the instruction of Silver Spring senior management, representatives of Evercore distributed a bid process letter
to each of Party C, Party E, Party F, Party G and Party H requesting that each party return an initial non-binding indication of
interest describing terms for a potential acquisition of Silver Spring by May 31, 2017.

Later on May 24, 2017, Party E indicated that it was not interested in pursuing a business combination transaction with Silver
Spring.

On May 25, 2017, the Silver Spring board held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and a representative of Evercore
present, during which Evercore discussed the market check activities that Evercore had conducted and the feedback received from
potential bidders that Evercore had approached on behalf of Silver Spring. Also during the meeting, Mr. Bell discussed other
strategic alternatives, including efforts to expand Silver Spring’s IoT business. In addition, the Silver Spring board ratified the
establishment of the Strategy Committee.

On May 26, 2017, representatives of Evercore provided representatives of each of Itron, Party C, Party F, Party G and Party H with
additional financial information of Silver Spring to supplement what had previously been provided to such parties. Subsequently,
certain of such parties requested additional information, which was provided by representatives of Evercore.

Later on May 26, 2017, a representative of Itron delivered to representatives of Silver Spring a revised non-binding proposal to
acquire all of Silver Spring’s outstanding common stock at a price of $15.00 per share in cash on a fully diluted basis. The proposal
was at the low end of Itron’s initial price range of $15.00 to $16.00 per share based on the additional diligence Itron had conducted
since submitting its April 25 proposal, including reviewing Silver Spring’s financial results for the quarterly period ended March 31,
2017, and Itron’s review and discussions with Silver Spring senior management of Silver Spring’s non-public information. Itron’s
May 26 proposal also requested further diligence regarding Silver Spring’s financial and accounting information. Itron’s May 26
proposal also requested that Silver Spring enter into a 30-day exclusivity period during which Itron would conduct due diligence
and Itron and Silver Spring would negotiate definitive agreements.

On May 30, 2017, each of Party F and Party G indicated that it was not interested in pursuing a business combination transaction
with Silver Spring.

Later on May 30, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of
Evercore present, during which the representatives of Evercore provided an update to the Committee on the market check process,
including the recent withdrawal by each of Party E, Party F and Party G. The Committee members, Silver Spring senior
management and representatives of Evercore then discussed ongoing conversations between Silver Spring senior management and
Itron senior management, potential negotiation strategies with Itron in relation to its revised offer, and the lack of any further
outreach from Party C and Party H. Evercore and Silver Spring senior management also discussed Silver Spring’s valuation and
potential synergies that could be realized in a transaction with Itron, potential significant commercial transactions in Silver Spring’s
pipeline and Silver Spring senior management’s view on the likely timing of such commercial transactions.

On June 1, 2017, Party H indicated that it was not interested in pursuing a business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

Also on June 1, 2017, representatives of Evercore discussed with a representative of a public company (which we refer to as Party I
in this proxy statement) that had responded to Evercore’s initial outreach, regarding a potential business combination transaction
with Silver Spring.

On June 4, 2017, the Silver Spring board held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of each of
Evercore and Fenwick present. During the meeting, the board, senior management and representatives of each of Evercore and
Fenwick reviewed and discussed Itron’s May 26 proposal, including

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Itron’s request for exclusivity. A representative of Evercore discussed the status of the market check process, the discussions that
had been held with, and the level of interest expressed by, each of Itron, Party C, Party E, Party F, Party G and Party H, the initial
contact by Party I, and that each of Party E, Party F, Party G and Party H had indicated that they were not interested in pursuing a
business combination with Silver Spring. Evercore also made a presentation to the board regarding its updated valuation models for
Silver Spring based on the management case forecasts and certain publicly available business and financial information relating to
Silver Spring that Evercore deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts’ estimates, which we refer to as the
street case forecasts as defined and described below under the section titled “Certain Prospective Financial Information Reviewed
by the Silver Spring Board of Directors and Silver Spring’s Financial Advisor”, following Silver Spring’s announcement of its
financial results for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2017, and provided an analysis of Itron’s recent offer of $15.00 per share
relative to Silver Spring’s current and historical price per share and various implied valuation multiples. The board and Silver Spring
senior management also discussed the possibility of making an additional contact with Party B, and Mr. Bell’s efforts to contact a
representative of Party C. Following discussion, the board determined that, while a banker-to-banker discussion between Evercore
and Centerview was appropriate at that time, the board believed that Itron’s price was too low and that discussions as to exclusivity
were inappropriate at that time.

On June 7, 2017, Silver Spring entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party I, which included a standstill provision similar to
the standstill provision included in the confidentiality agreement with Itron. The confidentiality agreement with Party I did not
include an exclusivity provision.

Also on June 7, 2017, representatives of Evercore discussed with a representative of a public company (which we refer to as Party J
in this proxy statement) that Evercore had previously contacted in its initial outreach, regarding Party J’s potential interest in a
business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

Between June 7, 2017 and June 23, 2017, at Party C’s request, representatives of Evercore and Silver Spring senior management
provided additional information to Party C regarding Silver Spring.

On June 9, 2017, members of Silver Spring senior management met with representatives of Party I to provide an overview of, and
answer questions regarding, Silver Spring’s business. During the meeting, Silver Spring senior management provided Party I with a
summary of the management case forecasts through December 31, 2020. Over the following weeks, representatives of Evercore
continued to have discussions with representatives of Party I, and provided Party I additional information with respect to Silver
Spring’s financial performance.

On June 13, 2017, a representative from Evercore contacted representatives of Centerview to discuss Itron’s May 26 proposal.

Later on June 13, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and a representative of
Evercore present, during which the Committee members and Evercore discussed the current status of the market check process and
negotiations with Itron.

On June 15, 2017, a representative of Evercore contacted representatives of Centerview to discuss Itron’s May 26 proposal, during
which the representative of Evercore indicated that Itron’s proposal of $15.00 per share was insufficient, and recommended that, as
a next step, Itron senior management meet with Silver Spring senior management and Evercore to discuss potential synergies that
could be achieved in a business combination transaction between Itron and Silver Spring.

On June 19, 2017, Silver Spring and Party J entered into a confidentiality agreement, which did not include a standstill provision,
because Party J would not enter into a confidentiality agreement that included a standstill provision, and Silver Spring senior
management, after discussion with representatives of Fenwick, determined that the benefit of including Party J in the potential sale
process outweighed the risk that Party J would propose a transaction directly to Silver Spring’s stockholders. The confidentiality
agreement with Party J did not include an exclusivity provision.

On June 22, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management present, during which the
Committee discussed the current status of the market check and strategy with respect to negotiations with Itron.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On June 26, 2017, members of Silver Spring senior management met with members of Itron senior management to discuss potential
synergies that could be achieved in a business combination of Itron and Silver Spring. Over the next several days, representatives of
Evercore provided additional financial information of Silver Spring to representatives of Itron.

On June 28, 2017, Silver Spring senior management and representatives of Evercore held a meeting with representatives of Itron to
discuss additional due diligence questions that had been provided to Silver Spring by representatives of Itron.

On June 29, 2017, members of Silver Spring senior management held a meeting with representatives of Party J to provide an
overview of, and answer questions regarding, Silver Spring’s business. During the meeting, Silver Spring senior management
provided Party J with a summary of the management case forecasts through December 31, 2020.

On June 30, 2017, Mr. Mezey contacted Mr. Van Camp to further discuss Itron’s May 26 proposal. Mr. Mezey indicated that while
the discussion of potential synergies on June 26, 2017 had been helpful in validating Itron’s current view of the value of Silver
Spring, it did not materially change Itron’s view on valuation.

On July 2, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of each of
Evercore and Fenwick present. During the meeting, the representatives of Evercore provided an update on its market check
activities, particularly with respect to Itron, Party C and Party J. Mr. Bell discussed the recent meetings and discussions between
Silver Spring senior management and Itron senior management. The Committee members, Mr. Bell and the representatives of
Evercore then discussed next steps with respect to responding to Itron’s May 26 proposal. The Committee members and
representatives of Evercore discussed the objectives of increasing Itron’s bid to the highest price possible and keeping Itron engaged
with a reasonable counterproposal, while not agreeing to Itron’s request for exclusivity and allowing Silver Spring to complete its
market check process. The Committee members agreed to recommend to the board that a counterproposal of $18.00 per share would
be delivered to Itron, along with information regarding Silver Spring’s preliminary financial results for the quarterly period ended
June 30, 2017. After representatives of Evercore departed the meeting, the Committee members, Silver Spring senior management
and a representative of Fenwick discussed Evercore’s engagement letter, and the engagement of Evercore as Silver Spring’s
financial advisor. The Committee members agreed to recommend to the board that Silver Spring engage Evercore as its financial
advisor.

Later on July 2, 2017, the Silver Spring board held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of each of
Evercore and Fenwick present. During the meeting, Mr. Van Camp and a representative of Evercore provided an update on the
meetings and conversations with representatives of Itron and the market check process. Mr. Van Camp and a representative of
Evercore then discussed the Strategy Committee’s recommendation regarding a counterproposal to Itron, at a price of $18.00 per
share, which would be delivered with information regarding Silver Spring’s preliminary financial results for the quarterly period
ended June 30, 2017. After discussion, the Silver Spring board authorized Evercore to present the counterproposal as discussed.
Following the dismissal of representatives of Evercore from the meeting, the board, with a member of senior management and a
representative of Fenwick present, discussed the proposed engagement letter with Evercore. After discussion, the board
unanimously approved the engagement of Evercore as Silver Spring’s financial advisor. Later that same day, Silver Spring entered
into the engagement letter with Evercore.

On July 6, 2017, a representative of Evercore, on behalf of the Silver Spring board, communicated the $18.00 per share
counterproposal to representatives of Centerview. That same day, a representative of Evercore delivered to a representative of Itron
information regarding Silver Spring’s preliminary financial results for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2017, and proposed a call
between Silver Spring senior management and Itron senior management to discuss such information.

On July 10, 2017, Party C submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire all of Silver Spring’s outstanding common stock at a price of
$15.00 per share in cash on a fully diluted basis. Party C’s proposal was subject to the satisfactory completion of its due diligence,
but did not include any request that Silver Spring enter into an exclusivity agreement with Party C.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On July 11, 2017, members of Silver Spring senior management and representatives of Evercore held a meeting with representatives
of Itron to discuss Silver Spring’s preliminary financial results for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2017.

On July 12, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of each of
Evercore and Fenwick present. During the meeting, the Committee members and representatives of Evercore discussed Party C’s
proposal and negotiation tactics with respect to Itron and Party C. A representative of Evercore provided an update on discussions
with Party I and Party J, and Mr. Bell discussed the possibility of arranging a meeting with the CEO of Party J. The Committee
members, senior management and representatives of Evercore then discussed the relative benefits of reaching out to additional
parties who were not part of Evercore’s initial market outreach efforts.

That same day, members of Silver Spring senior management held a meeting with representatives of Party I to provide an overview
of, and answer questions regarding, Silver Spring’s business. During the meeting, Silver Spring senior management provided Party I
a summary of the management case forecasts through December 31, 2020. Later that same day, representatives of Evercore
delivered additional information and a letter to Party I, which letter requested that Party I return an initial non-binding indication of
interest describing terms for a potential acquisition of Silver Spring by July 20, 2017.

Also on July 12, 2017, a representative of Evercore contacted a representative of Party C to discuss Party C’s proposal, during
which the representative of Evercore, at the direction of the Strategy Committee, indicated that Party’s C’s proposal of $15.00 per
share was insufficient.

On July 14, 2017, Mr. Mezey contacted Mr. Van Camp to inquire whether the parties could reach an agreement on price if Itron
modestly improved its previous offer of $15.00 per share. Mr. Mezey indicated that Itron was still at $15.00 per share, but that Mr.
Mezey believed that he could obtain support from Itron’s board of directors to increase the proposed price slightly. In response, Mr.
Van Camp stated that Silver Spring had another offer from another potential acquirer and that Itron’s May 26 proposal of $15.00 per
share was insufficient. Mr. Van Camp reminded Mr. Mezey of Silver Spring’s counterproposal of $18.00 per share, and stated that
Itron would need to make its best effort in responding to Silver Spring’s counterproposal.

On July 15, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of each of
Evercore and Fenwick present, during which the Committee and its advisors discussed the call between Mr. Mezey and Mr. Van
Camp the previous day. Also during the meeting, a representative of Evercore provided an update on recent discussions with Party
C, Party I and Party J, including a proposed meeting between Mr. Bell and the CEO of Party J that was being planned for July 17,
2017. The Committee and its advisors further discussed strategies for negotiations with Itron and Party C.

On July 17, 2017, Mr. Bell and representatives of Evercore met with the CEO of Party J to discuss a potential business combination
transaction between Silver Spring and Party J.

On July 18, 2017, Party I indicated that it was not interested in pursuing a business combination with Silver Spring.

July 20, 2016, representatives of Party C contacted representatives of Evercore and stated that Party C was withdrawing from the
process because it would likely decrease its offer to a price below $15.00 per share due to the risks that Party C perceived in
proceeding with a business combination transaction with Silver Spring, and therefore did not believe that it could remain
competitive in the process.

Also on July 20, 2017, representatives of Evercore contacted representatives of Party J to discuss the meeting held on July 17, 2017,
among Mr. Bell, representatives of Evercore and the CEO of Party J.

On July 21, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of each of
Evercore and Fenwick present. During the meeting, a representative of Evercore provided an update on discussions with Party C,
Itron and Party J, including the meeting between Mr. Bell and the CEO of Party J on July 17, 2017, and the July 20 discussion with
the representative of Party C. The Committee members and representatives of Evercore discussed the process for sending a bid
process letter to Itron and Party J. After discussion, the Committee instructed Evercore to inform Itron and Party J that proposals
should be submitted by August 11, 2017.

Also on July 21, 2017, representatives of Evercore delivered a letter to Itron and Party J, requesting that each of Itron and Party J
return, by August 11, 2017, a non-binding indication of interest describing terms for a potential acquisition of Silver Spring. Later
that same day, a draft merger agreement, prepared by representatives of Fenwick, which we refer to as the draft merger agreement in
this proxy statement, was made available to representatives of each of Itron and Party J.

On July 22, 2017, representatives of Evercore provided representatives of Itron access to a virtual data room containing non-public
information of Silver Spring. Between July 22, 2017 and September 17, 2017, Itron continued its due diligence, including reviewing
the materials provided in the virtual data room and scheduling and participating in due diligence conference calls and meetings with
Silver Spring senior management.

On July 24, 2017, representatives of Evercore provided representatives of Party J access to a virtual data room containing non-
public information of Silver Spring.

On July 27, 2017, Mr. Van Camp, on behalf of the Strategy Committee, requested that Evercore contact representatives of a public
company (which we refer to as Party K in this proxy statement) that had not previously been contacted in Evercore’s initial
outreach, to discuss Party K’s possible interest in a business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

On July 30, 2017, and on August 2, 2017, representatives of Evercore contacted representatives of Party K to discuss Party K’s
possible interest in a business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

On August 11, 2017, Itron submitted a third revised non-binding proposal to acquire all of Silver Spring’s outstanding common
stock at a price of $15.00 per share in cash on a fully diluted basis, which proposal also requested that Silver Spring enter into a 14-
day exclusivity period. In addition to the proposal letter, Itron delivered an executed commitment letter from Wells Fargo for debt
financing of up to $1.1 billion in connection with Itron’s proposed acquisition of Silver Spring. That same day, representatives of
Itron provided representatives of Silver Spring with Itron’s proposed revisions to the draft merger agreement, which included a
termination fee in the amount of 3.85% of the aggregate merger consideration, and a requirement that certain stockholders of Silver
Spring enter into a voting agreement. Party J did not return a non-binding indication of interest for a potential acquisition of Silver
Spring.

On August 12, 2017, the Silver Spring board held a special meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of
each of Evercore and Fenwick present. During the meeting, the Silver Spring board discussed Itron’s August 11 proposal of $15.00
per share, and Itron’s proposed changes to the draft merger agreement. In an executive session of the board, with a member of senior
management and a representative of Fenwick present, the members of the board then discussed their views of the value of Silver
Spring, including in the event that Silver Spring were to remain as a standalone company, and instructed senior management to
prepare a presentation as to the strategy to achieve growth in its core business and expand into new markets and/or solutions
(including relative to Silver Spring’s IoT business), and the related operational risks, including the potential failure to close
projected deals and the potential failure of Silver Spring’s IoT business to grow as rapidly as anticipated. The board then discussed
Itron’s proposed changes to the draft merger agreement with a member of senior management and a representative of Fenwick.
During a session of the independent members of the Silver Spring board, Mr. Van Camp provided an overview of the market check
process that had been conducted to date, including recent interest in a potential transaction expressed by Party K, and presented
what he considered to be the three viable alternatives for Silver Spring, which were to continue with a potential business
combination transaction, to remain as a standalone company and execute on its current strategy, or to remain as a standalone
company and re-examine Silver Spring’s current strategy. The independent members then discussed the viability and advisability of
each of these alternatives.

Later on August 12, 2017, Silver Spring entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party K, which included a standstill provision
similar to the standstill provision in the confidentiality agreement with Itron. The confidentiality agreement with Party K did not
include any exclusivity provision.

On August 15, 2017, members of Silver Spring senior management held a meeting with representatives of Party K to provide an
overview of, and answer questions regarding, Silver Spring’s business. During the meeting, Silver Spring senior management
provided Party K with a summary of the management case forecasts through December 31, 2020.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Later on August 15, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of
each of Evercore and Fenwick present, during which the Committee members, senior management and representatives of each of
Evercore and Fenwick discussed negotiation tactics with regard to Itron’s August 11 proposal, the recent discussions with Party K
and the lack of response from Party J. After discussion, the Committee agreed that a counterproposal of $16.75 per share would be
made in response to Itron’s August 11 proposal, along with a revised draft merger agreement. The Committee members instructed
Evercore to communicate such counterproposal to representatives of Centerview.

Spring’s proposed revisions to the draft merger agreement.

On August 17, 2017, representatives of a private equity firm (which we refer to as Party L in this proxy statement) that was not
previously contacted by Evercore, contacted representatives of Evercore regarding Party L’s potential interest in a business
combination transaction with Silver Spring. That same day, Silver Spring senior management requested that Evercore contact
representatives of Party L to discuss Party L’s potential interest in a business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

On August 18, 2017, Party K indicated that it was not interested in pursuing a business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

each of Evercore and Fenwick present. During the meeting, Mr. Bell made a presentation to the board regarding Silver Spring’s
standalone strategic goals for the next 36 months, including an objective to optimize operational and financial performance and its
competitive position through international expansion, new solutions, IoT growth and gross margin improvements. The board
discussed operational and timing risks associated with this strategy. Following this discussion, representatives of Evercore provided
an update on recent discussions with Party J, Party K and Party L. The board and its advisors then discussed strategy and next steps
with respect to negotiations with Itron. In an executive session, with a member of senior management and representatives of
Fenwick present, a representative of Fenwick reviewed for the board its fiduciary duties in connection with a potential sale of Silver
Spring.

On August 21, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of each of
Evercore and Fenwick present, during which meeting the Committee and its advisors discussed likely next steps and strategies
following the anticipated receipt of a response from Itron to Silver Spring’s August 16 counterproposal. The Committee also
discussed the status of other potential bidders in the process as well as Silver Spring senior management’s strategy presentation on
August 19, Silver Spring’s 2017 guidance (which had been made publicly available at the time that Silver Spring publicly
announced its financial results for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2017) and Silver Spring’s internal financial plan.

Also on August 21, 2017, a representative of Centerview communicated to representatives of Evercore that Itron was increasing its
offer to $15.50 per share.

Later on August 21, 2017, representatives of Jones Day provided representatives of Fenwick with Itron’s proposed revisions to the
draft merger agreement.

On August 22, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of each of
Evercore and Fenwick present, during which the Committee and its advisors discussed the increase in Itron’s offer to $15.50 per
share, strategies and next steps. The Committee determined that Silver Spring should make a counterproposal at a price of $16.50
per share and with respect to certain key terms of the merger agreement, and instructed Evercore to communicate such
counterproposal to Centerview. Later that same day, a representative of Evercore communicated to a representative of Centerview
Silver Spring’s counterproposal of $16.50 per share and response regarding certain key terms of the merger agreement.

On August 23, 2017, Silver Spring entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party L, which included a standstill provision
similar to the standstill provision included in the confidentiality agreement with Itron. The confidentiality agreement with Party L

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On August 24, 2017, Mr. Mezey contacted Mr. Van Camp and communicated that Itron had increased its offer to $16.00 per share,
and that Itron was prepared to move quickly to complete a transaction. Mr. Mezey also requested that Silver Spring enter into an
exclusivity agreement with Itron to continue negotiating the transaction. In response, Mr. Van Camp stated that Itron would need to
improve its bid to $16.50 per share in order for Silver Spring to agree to exclusivity.

Also on August 24, 2017, a representative of Centerview communicated to representatives of Evercore that Itron had increased its
offer to $16.00 per share.

Later on August 24, 2017, the Silver Spring board held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of
each of Evercore and Fenwick present. During the meeting, the Silver Spring board and its advisors discussed Itron’s most recent
offer of $16.00 per share, including Itron’s request for exclusivity. The board also discussed the risks associated with Itron obtaining
financing for the transaction and other deal terms that related to deal certainty. Also during the meeting, Silver Spring senior
management presented a strategy for Silver Spring to achieve growth in its core business and expand into new markets and/or
solutions if a business combination transaction involving Silver Spring was not consummated. The Silver Spring board and its
advisors then discussed the relative benefits and risks of Silver Spring remaining as a standalone company (including related timing
and operational risks, and the risk that material results in the IoT business would not develop as rapidly as anticipated). After
discussion, a representative of Evercore provided an update on the status of discussions with Party C, Party J and Party L. During
the meeting, a representative of Fenwick reviewed for the board its fiduciary duties in connection with a potential sale of Silver
Spring. Later that same day, at the direction of the Silver Spring board, a representative of Evercore contacted a representative of
Centerview to reiterate Silver Spring’s previous counterproposal of $16.50 per share.

On August 25, 2017, representatives of Jones Day and representatives of Fenwick discussed the remaining open issues in the draft
merger agreement, including the regulatory efforts standard and the termination fee.

On August 26, 2017, representatives of Evercore held a meeting with representatives of Centerview, during which the parties
discussed the remaining open issues in the draft merger agreement and open diligence issues. Representatives of Centerview also
indicated that if Itron were to revise its previous proposal of $16.00 per share, any revision would be Itron’s best and final offer.

On August 28, 2017, a representative of Centerview communicated to representatives of Evercore that Itron had increased its bid to
$16.25 per share, and reiterated that this was Itron’s best and final offer.

On August 29, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of each of
Evercore and Fenwick present, during which the Committee and its advisors discussed Itron’s increase of its bid to $16.25 per share,

the draft merger agreement.

On August 30, 2017, Mr. Bell contacted a representative of Party J to inquire as to Party J’s interest in continuing to pursue a

J would pursue a possible business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

On September 1, 2017, members of Silver Spring senior management held a meeting with representatives of Party L, which meeting
included a representative of an affiliate of Party L, to provide an overview of, and answer questions regarding, Silver Spring’s
business. During the meeting, Silver Spring senior management provided Party L with a summary of the management case forecasts
through December 31, 2020.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Also on September 6, 2017, Mr. Bell contacted a representative of Party C to discuss an additional meeting to be held between
Silver Spring senior management and Party C senior management to discuss a potential transaction with Silver Spring.

On September 7, 2017, a representative of Party L communicated to a representative of Evercore that, while a stock merger between
Silver Spring and a portfolio company of Party L (which might not imply a premium for Silver Spring) might be worth discussing
from Party L’s viewpoint, Party L did not believe it would be competitive in a process that contemplated an all-cash transaction with
a premium, and therefore was not interested in pursuing a business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

On September 8, 2017, a representative of Jones Day provided representatives of Fenwick with Itron’s proposed revisions to the
draft merger agreement and a draft form of voting agreement.

Later on September 8, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of
each of Evercore and Fenwick present. During the meeting, the Committee and its advisors discussed the status of negotiations with
Itron, including its continued bid of $16.25 and the fact that Itron had continued to ask for exclusivity, and the status of discussions
with Party C, Party J, and Party L. The Committee members also discussed a proposed meeting with an additional public company
(which we refer to as Party M in this proxy statement), to discuss a potential business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

Between September 8, 2017 and September 16, 2017, representatives of Jones Day and Fenwick continued to negotiate the terms of
the draft merger agreement and the voting agreement.

On September 10, 2017, a public company (which we refer to as Party N in this proxy statement) that was not previously contacted
by Evercore contacted representatives of Evercore regarding a potential business combination with Silver Spring.

Between September 12, 2017 and September 13, 2017, representatives of Silver Spring senior management contacted each of Party
M and Party N regarding a potential business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

On September 13, 2017, members of Silver Spring senior management met with representatives of Party M regarding a potential
business combination transaction with Silver Spring. That same day, Party N indicated that it was not interested in pursuing a
business combination transaction with Silver Spring in a timeframe that would enable it to be competitive with other potential
buyers.

On September 14, 2017, Silver Spring entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party M, which did not include a standstill
provision. Silver Spring did not request a standstill provision in the confidentiality agreement with Party M because the potential
delays associated with negotiating a confidentiality agreement that included such provision with Party M might preclude having
discussions between Party M and Silver Spring senior management on the timeline that Party M proposed. The confidentiality
agreement with Party M did not include an exclusivity period.

Later on September 14, 2017, the Strategy Committee held a meeting, with Silver Spring senior management and representatives of
each of Evercore and Fenwick present. During the meeting, the Committee discussed a proposed meeting with Party C that was
scheduled for the morning of September 18, 2017, and Itron’s proposal that the parties would sign the draft merger agreement on
September 17, 2017, and announce the transaction the following morning. The Committee and the representatives of each of
Evercore and Fenwick discussed the possibility of delaying the final approval of the transaction with Itron until after the meeting
scheduled with Party C. During the discussions, representatives of Evercore and Fenwick described the potential risks related to
such a delay, including the risk that Itron would withdraw its offer, and the likelihood that Party C would make a topping bid after
public announcement of Silver Spring signing the merger agreement with Itron, given Party C’s earlier decision not to pursue a
transaction with Silver Spring. The Committee determined that Mr. Van Camp should propose to Mr. Mezey that the signing of the
merger agreement be delayed by 24 hours, thereby enabling Mr. Bell and others to meet with representatives of Party C on
September 18, 2017.

On September 15, 2017, Mr. Van Camp communicated to Mr. Mezey Silver Spring’s proposal that the signing of the merger
agreement be delayed by 24 hours. In response, Mr. Mezey stated that Itron would withdraw from the process if there were any
delay in signing the merger agreement after September 17, 2017. Thereafter, Mr. Van Camp stated that Silver Spring would
withdraw its request to delay the signing of the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Also on September 15, 2017, Party M indicated that it was not interested in pursuing a business combination transaction with Silver
Spring.

On September 16, 2017, Mr. Bell contacted a representative of Party C, and provided the representative with additional information
pertaining to Silver Spring’s recent and potential financial performance, and Silver Spring’s strategic fit with Party C.

On September 17, 2017, each of Mr. Bell and Warren Weiss, a member of the Silver Spring board, contacted a representative of
Party C to discuss a potential business combination transaction with Silver Spring.

Later on September 17, 2017, the Silver Spring board met for the purpose of reviewing the final terms of the proposed merger
agreement. Prior to the meeting, the final form of the proposed merger agreement and the voting agreement had been circulated to
the board. At the beginning of the meeting, Mr. Weiss and Mr. Bell provided an update to the board on their discussions with a
representative of Party C. Representatives of Fenwick then reviewed the negotiated resolution of the remaining issues in the merger
agreement and voting agreement, and again reviewed the Board’s fiduciary duties. Representatives of Evercore reviewed Evercore’s
financial analysis of the proposed merger. Following this presentation, Evercore rendered an oral opinion to the Silver Spring board,
subsequently confirmed in its written opinion dated September 17, 2017, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based
upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the merger consideration
was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the shares of Silver Spring common stock entitled to receive such merger
consideration. Following discussion, the Silver Spring board unanimously (1) approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, (2)
authorized management to submit the merger agreement to the Silver Spring stockholders for adoption at the Silver Spring
stockholder meeting and (3) recommended that Silver Spring’s stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Later on September 17, 2017, the parties executed the merger agreement.

On September 18, 2017, prior to the opening of the financial markets that day, the parties issued a joint press release publicly
announcing entry into the merger agreement.

Reasons for the Merger

In evaluating the merger and the merger agreement, the Silver Spring board consulted with Silver Spring senior management as well
as Silver Spring’s legal and financial advisors. In determining to approve the merger agreement and the merger and recommend that
Silver Spring stockholders vote their shares of Silver Spring common stock in favor of the proposal to approve the merger
agreement, the merger and the principal terms thereof, the Silver Spring board considered a number of factors in favor of the
merger, including the following (but they did not assign any weighting to these factors as to their relative importance):

• the fact that the merger consideration represents:

• a 25.0% premium over Silver Spring’s closing share price of $13.00 on September 15, 2017, the last trading day prior
to the public announcement of the merger agreement with Itron;

• a 28.5% premium over Silver Spring’s closing share price of $12.65 on September 8, 2017;

• a 25.4% premium over Silver Spring’s closing share price of $12.96 on August 15, 2017;

• a 38.3% premium over Silver Spring’s average closing share price of $11.75 over the three-month period ending
September 15, 2017;

• a 44.5% premium over Silver Spring’s average closing share price of $11.25 over the six-month period ending
September 15, 2017;

• a 32.1% premium over Silver Spring’s average closing share price of $12.30 over the 12-month period ending
September 15, 2017;

• a 27.5% premium over Silver Spring’s average closing share price of $12.74 over the 24-month period ending
September 15, 2017;

• a 37.2% premium over Silver Spring’s average closing share price of $11.85 over the 36-month period ending
September 15, 2017;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• a 65.5% premium over Silver Spring’s lowest closing share price of $9.82 over the 52-week period ending September
15, 2017; and

• a 5.6% premium over Silver Spring’s highest closing share price of $15.39 over the 52-week period ending
September 15, 2017.

• the opinion, dated September 17, 2017, of Evercore to the Silver Spring board to the effect that, as of the date of such
opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations set forth
therein, the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the shares of Silver Spring
common stock entitled to receive such Merger Consideration, as more fully described in the section entitled “—Opinion of
Silver Spring’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 46 of this proxy statement;

• its belief, based on discussions and negotiations by Silver Spring senior management and advisors with Itron and other
potentially interested parties, that the merger consideration (which Itron increased from an initial offer of $15.00 per share
of Silver Spring common stock to the final $16.25 per share of Silver Spring common stock during the course of
negotiations, as described in the section entitled “—Background of the Merger” beginning on page 30 of this proxy
statement) was the highest price Itron or any other interested party would be willing to pay;

• its familiarity with Silver Spring’s business, operations, assets, properties, business strategy and competitive position and
the nature of the industries in which Silver Spring operates, industry trends, and economic and market conditions, both on
a historical and on a prospective basis;

• its belief that, based on its knowledge and discussions with Silver Spring senior management regarding Silver Spring’s
business, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, business strategy and prospects, as well as the
risks (including the risks described in Silver Spring’s filings with the SEC) involved in, and the timing and likelihood of
actually achieving additional value for Silver Spring stockholders from successfully executing on Silver Spring’s business
strategy, that on a risk-adjusted basis, remaining independent and executing on Silver Spring’s business strategy was not
reasonably likely to create value for Silver Spring stockholders greater than the merger consideration;

• that the Silver Spring board, with the assistance of Silver Spring senior management and Evercore, considered other
parties that would be most likely to have a strategic interest in, and financial ability to complete, a business combination
with Silver Spring and solicited the interest of such parties, and that none of the parties contacted indicated an interest in
paying a higher price per share than $16.25 per share of Silver Spring common stock;

• the fact that the merger consideration consists solely of cash, which provides certainty of value and liquidity to Silver
Spring stockholders and does not expose them to any future risks related to the business or the financial markets generally,
as compared to a transaction in which stockholders receive shares or other securities, or as compared to Silver Spring
remaining independent;

• its belief that the conditions to closing in the merger agreement (as described in in the section entitled “Terms of the
Merger Agreement—Conditions to Consummation of the Merger” beginning on page 97 of this proxy statement),
including the definition of “Material Adverse Effect” in the merger agreement (as described in in the section entitled
“Terms of the Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties—Material Adverse Effect Definition” beginning on
page 82 of this proxy statement) provide a high degree of likelihood that the merger will be consummated;

• its belief, based on the Silver Spring board’s general knowledge of Itron’s business, operations, management, reputation
and financial condition, that there was a high probability that the merger would be successfully consummated on the
agreed-upon terms after a merger agreement was entered into with Itron;

• the fact that Itron’s obligation to consummate the transaction is not subject to any financing condition and the fact that
Itron has entered into the commitment letter pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Wells
Fargo has committed to debt financing of up to $1.1 billion in connection with Itron’s proposed acquisition of Silver
Spring;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• Silver Spring’s ability to specifically enforce Itron’s obligations under the merger agreement, including Itron’s obligations
to consummate the merger, and Silver Spring’s ability to seek damages upon any willful breach by Itron associated with
the failure of the financing to occur;

• Silver Spring’s right under the merger agreement to respond to third parties submitting unsolicited acquisition proposals
by providing information subject to a confidentiality agreement, and to engage in negotiations or discussions with such
persons, if the Silver Spring board, prior to taking any such actions, determines in good faith that such acquisition proposal
either constitutes a “superior proposal” or could reasonably be expected to lead to a “superior proposal” (as described in
the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—No Solicitation by Silver Spring of Acquisition Proposals; Changes
in Board Recommendation” beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement);

• the right of the Silver Spring board, under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, to withdraw, qualify or
modify its recommendation that Silver Spring stockholders adopt the merger agreement in the event that a “superior
proposal” is made to Silver Spring, subject to certain conditions set forth in the merger agreement (including Itron’s right
to have an opportunity to revise the terms of the merger agreement) and Silver Spring’s obligation to pay the termination
fee of $32.3 million in the event that Silver Spring or Itron were to terminate the merger agreement following such
withdrawal, qualification or modification;

• the right of the Silver Spring board, under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, to withdraw, qualify or
modify its recommendation that Silver Spring stockholders adopt the merger agreement in the event that an “intervening
event” with respect to Silver Spring occurs, subject to certain conditions set forth in the merger agreement (including
Itron’s right to have an opportunity to revise the terms of the merger agreement) and Silver Spring’s obligation to pay the
termination fee of $32.3 million in event that Itron were to terminate the merger agreement following such withdrawal,
qualification or modification;

• Silver Spring’s ability to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement that the Silver
Spring board determines to be a “superior proposal”, subject to certain conditions set forth in the merger agreement
(including Itron’s right to have an opportunity to revise the terms of the merger agreement) and Silver Spring’s obligation
to pay the termination fee of $32.3 million;

• its belief, after discussion with Silver Spring’s advisors, that the termination fee of $32.3 million, which constitutes
approximately 3.4% of Silver Spring’s equity value in the merger, would not preclude or substantially impede a possible
superior proposal from being made;

• the requirement that the merger will only be effective if approved by the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding
shares of Silver Spring common stock, providing Silver Spring stockholders with the right to approve or disapprove of the
merger;

• the fact that Silver Spring stockholders will be entitled to dissenters rights under Delaware law;

• its belief that the merger agreement’s restrictions on Silver Spring’s ability to take certain actions during the pendency of
the merger will not unduly interfere with Silver Spring’s ability to operate its business in the ordinary course;

• the fact that the merger does not require the approval of Itron’s stockholders, with the attendant risks associated with such
a vote;

• its belief that the terms of the merger agreement, taken as a whole, provide a high degree of protection against the risk that
the consummation of the merger will be unduly delayed or that the merger will not be consummated;

• its belief, following consultation with legal counsel, that the transaction with Itron presented a limited risk of not achieving
regulatory clearance, or having a delay in consummation of the transaction due to regulatory review, and the fact that the
merger agreement also requires Itron to take certain actions necessary to achieve regulatory clearance for the merger;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• that the merger agreement was the product of arms-length negotiations and contains terms and conditions that are, in the
Silver Spring board’s view, favorable to Silver Spring and its stockholders; and

• the continued costs, risks and uncertainties associated with continuing to operate independently as a public company.

In addition, the Silver Spring board considered a number of uncertainties, risks and other factors weighing against the merger in its
deliberations, including the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):

• the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement that restrict Silver Spring’s ability to solicit or, subject to certain
exceptions, engage in discussions or negotiations with third parties regarding a proposal to acquire Silver Spring, and the
fact that, upon termination of the merger agreement under certain specified circumstances, Silver Spring will be required
to pay a termination fee of $32.3 million, which could have the effect of discouraging alternative proposals for a business
combination with Silver Spring or reduce the price of such proposal;

• the fact that the all-cash price, while providing relative certainty of value, would not allow Silver Spring stockholders to
participate in any future appreciation of Itron’s stock or benefit from any future appreciation in the value of Silver Spring
after the merger;

• the fact that the merger agreement restricts Silver Spring’s ability to engage in certain activities between the date of the
merger agreement and the effective time of the merger, and that these restrictions could prevent Silver Spring from taking
advantage of business opportunities, such as potential acquisitions, which would be advisable if Silver Spring were to
remain an independent company;

• the fact that the merger may not be consummated unless and until specified conditions are satisfied or waived as more
fully described in the section entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Conditions to Consummation of the Merger”
beginning on page 97 of this proxy statement, and the right of Itron to terminate the merger agreement under certain
circumstances;

• the potential risk and costs to Silver Spring related to the announcement of the merger and the possibility that the merger
does not close, including the potential distraction of employee and management attention during the pendency of the
merger, possible employee attrition, the possible impact on existing and prospective customers and business partners, the
potential effect on existing relationships with other parties, and the impact that the failure of the merger to close could
have on the trading price of shares of Silver Spring common stock, Silver Spring’s operating results (including the costs
incurred in connection with the transactions) and Silver Spring’s ability to maintain sales, but the Silver Spring board
believed that these risks were reasonable and worthwhile to undertake considering the terms of the merger agreement,
including the likelihood that conditions to closing would be satisfied, and the absence of a financing condition; and

• the fact that receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for shares of Silver Spring common stock pursuant to the
merger would generally be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes as more fully described in
the section entitled “—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 66 of this proxy
statement.

During its consideration of the merger, the Silver Spring board also was aware of the fact that some of Silver Spring’s directors and
executive officers have interests in the merger that differ from or are in addition to their interests as those of Silver Spring
stockholders generally, which interests are described in the section entitled “—Interests of Silver Spring’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 58 of this proxy statement.

The foregoing description of the information and factors considered by the Silver Spring board is not meant to be an exhaustive but
is believed to address the material information and factors considered. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the Silver
Spring board, it did not consider it practicable to, nor did it attempt to, quantify or to give relative weights to the various factors in
reaching its determinations and recommendation. Moreover, in considering the factors discussed above, each individual director
applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have given different weights to different factors. The

board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor,
supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Silver Spring board based its recommendation on the totality of the
information presented.

Recommendation of the Silver Spring Board of Directors

The Silver Spring board, after considering all factors that the Silver Spring board deemed relevant, and after consultation with
independent legal and financial advisors, unanimously (i) determined that the merger agreement and the merger are fair to, and in
the best interests of, Silver Spring and its stockholders, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement, (ii) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, and (iii) resolved to recommend that Silver
Spring stockholders approve the merger agreement, the merger and the principal terms thereof. Certain factors considered by the
Silver Spring board in reaching these decisions can be found in the section entitled “—Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page
42 of this proxy statement.

The Silver Spring board unanimously recommends that Silver Spring stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the merger
agreement and the merger.

Opinion of Silver Spring’s Financial Advisor

Silver Spring retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor in connection with evaluating strategic and financial alternatives,
including the merger. As part of this engagement, Silver Spring requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point
of view, of the merger consideration to be received by the holders of Silver Spring common stock entitled to receive such merger
consideration. At a meeting of the Silver Spring board of directors held on September 17, 2017, Evercore rendered its oral opinion
to the Silver Spring board of directors, which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated September
17, 2017, that, as of the date thereof, and based upon and subject to the factors, procedures, assumptions, qualifications, limitations
and other matters set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of Silver Spring common
stock entitled to receive such merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of Silver Spring common
stock.

The full text of Evercore’s written opinion, dated September 17, 2017, which sets forth, among other things, the factors
considered, procedures followed, assumptions made and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by
Evercore in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference in
its entirety. Silver Spring urges you to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Evercore’s opinion was addressed to,
and for the information and benefit of, the Silver Spring board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger.
Evercore’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to other business or financial strategies
that might be available to Silver Spring, nor did it address the underlying business decision of Silver Spring to engage in the
merger. Evercore’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the Silver Spring board of directors or to any other
persons in respect of the merger, including as to how any holder of shares of Silver Spring common stock should vote or act
with respect to the merger. The summary of Evercore’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of such opinion attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Evercore has consented to the
inclusion of its opinion as Annex B to this proxy statement.

In connection with rendering its opinion, Evercore, among other things:

• reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Silver Spring that Evercore deemed to be
relevant, including publicly available research analysts’ estimates;

• reviewed certain non-public historical financial statements and other non-public historical financial and operating data
relating to Silver Spring prepared and furnished to Evercore by management of Silver Spring;

• discussed the past and current operations, the financial projections and current financial condition of Silver Spring with
Silver Spring management (including their views on the risks and uncertainties of achieving such projections);

• reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of Silver Spring common stock;

• compared the financial performance of Silver Spring and its stock market trading multiples with those of certain other
publicly traded companies that Evercore deemed relevant;

• compared the financial performance of Silver Spring and the valuation multiples relating to the merger with those of
certain other transactions that Evercore deemed relevant;

• performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore deemed appropriate.

For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon, without undertaking any independent verification of,
the accuracy and completeness of all of the information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made
available to, discussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, and Evercore assumed no liability therefor. Evercore assumed that the
management case forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments of Silver Spring management as to the future financial performance of Silver Spring under the alternative business
assumptions reflected therein. Evercore expressed no view as to any projected financial data relating to Silver Spring or the
assumptions on which they are based.

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the representations and
warranties of each party contained in the merger agreement were true and correct, that each party would perform all of the
covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the merger agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of
the merger would be satisfied without material waiver or modification thereof. Evercore further assumed that all governmental,
regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the merger would be obtained without any
material delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the consummation of the merger or
materially reduce the benefits to the holders of Silver Spring common stock of the merger.

Evercore did not make or assume any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of
Silver Spring, nor was Evercore furnished with any such appraisals, nor did Evercore evaluate the solvency or fair value of Silver
Spring under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Evercore’s opinion was necessarily
based upon information made available to Evercore as of the date thereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as
they existed and as could be evaluated on the date thereof. It was understood that developments subsequent to Evercore’s opinion
could affect its opinion and that Evercore did not and does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

Evercore was not asked to pass upon, and expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to the holders of
Silver Spring common stock, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration. Evercore did not express any view on, and
its opinion did not address, the fairness of the proposed transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the
holders of any other securities, creditors or other constituencies of Silver Spring, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of
any compensation (other than the merger consideration in respect of Silver Spring common stock) to be paid or payable to any of
the officers, directors or employees of Silver Spring, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the merger consideration or
otherwise. Evercore assumed that any modification to the structure of the transaction would not vary in any respect material to its
analysis. Evercore’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to other business or financial strategies
that might be available to Silver Spring, nor did it address the underlying business decision of Silver Spring to engage in the merger.
Evercore’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the Silver Spring board of directors or to any other persons in respect of
the merger, including as to how any holder of shares of Silver Spring common stock should vote or act in respect of the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Summary of Material Financial Analyses

The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses that Evercore reviewed with the Silver Spring board of directors
on September 17, 2017, in connection with rendering Evercore’s opinion. The following summary does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The order of the analyses described and the results of these analyses do not
represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by Evercore or the Silver Spring board of directors. Except as
otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data that
existed on or before September 15, 2017 (the last trading date prior to the rendering of Evercore’s opinion) and is not necessarily
indicative of current market conditions.

The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate
and relevant methods of financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not
readily susceptible to summary description.

In arriving at its opinion, Evercore did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis considered by
it. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering
the results of all of the analyses. Considering selected portions of the analyses and reviews in the summary set forth below, without
considering the analyses and reviews as a whole, could create an incomplete or misleading view of the analyses and reviews
underlying Evercore’s opinion.

For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions, and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Silver Spring. No company, business or transaction
used in Evercore’s analyses and reviews as a comparison is identical to Silver Spring, the merger or the merger consideration, and
an evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve
complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions used in Evercore’s analyses and reviews. The
estimates contained in Evercore’s analyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or
review, are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than those suggested by Evercore’s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of
companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or
securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses and reviews
are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

The following summary of material financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. These tables must
be read together with the full text of each summary in order to understand fully the summary of material financial analyses
performed by Evercore. The tables are not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a complete description of the
material financial analyses performed by Evercore. Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative
description of the material financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of Evercore’s financial analyses.

In performing the financial analyses summarized below, Evercore utilized and relied upon the management case forecasts and the
street case forecasts. In performing the financial analyses based on the management case forecasts, Evercore relied upon projected
financial data prepared and furnished to Evercore by Silver Spring’s management, as described in the section entitled “Certain
Prospective Financial Information Reviewed by the Silver Spring Board of Directors and Silver Spring’s Financial Advisor”. In
performing the financial analyses based on the street case forecasts, Evercore relied on an average of Wall Street broker estimates
through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and, at the direction of Silver Spring’s management, extrapolated mathematical
projections based on those estimates for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2021, as described in the
section entitled “Certain Prospective Financial Information Reviewed by the Silver Spring Board of Directors and Silver Spring’s
Financial Advisor.”

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

As part of its analysis, Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Silver Spring. This is a method used to estimate the
implied present value of an asset by calculating the present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows to be generated
by that asset. The present value of those future unlevered free cash

TABLE OF CONTENTS

flows is then obtained by discounting those future unlevered free cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account
macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital and other appropriate factors. The “unlevered free
cash flow” refers to a calculation of the future cash flows generated by an asset without including in such calculation any debt
servicing costs. Specifically, unlevered free cash flow for this purpose represents earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, less
income tax expense, capital expenditures, increases in net working capital and certain other cash expenses, as applicable, plus
depreciation and amortization.

Evercore’s discounted cash flow analysis was intended to estimate the implied present value, as of June 30, 2017, of (1) the future
unlevered free cash flow that Silver Spring would generate during the period from July 1, 2017, through December 31, 2021, plus
(2) the estimated terminal value of Silver Spring as of December 31, 2021, using both the perpetuity growth methodology and the
terminal value methodology. Evercore performed its discounted cash flow analysis for Silver Spring on a standalone basis and
assumed the mid-year cash flow discounting convention. Evercore’s discounted cash flow analyses include value attributable to the
pre-tax value of certain tax attributes of $177 million outstanding as of December 31, 2016, which we refer to collectively as the
“tax attributes,” including $165 million attributable to net operating losses and $12 million attributable to the research tax credit.
Evercore incorporated the present value of the savings generated from the use of the tax attributes into its discounted cash flow
analysis assuming no change of control Section 382 limitation for Silver Spring’s net operating losses. Evercore conducted its
discounted cash flow analysis separately using the management case forecasts and the street case forecasts.

Under the perpetuity growth methodology, Evercore estimated a terminal value for Silver Spring by applying a perpetuity growth
rate of 3.0% to 5.0% to the estimated unlevered free cash flow of Silver Spring for the terminal year, which assumed, among other
things, projected levels of capital expenditure, changes in net working capital, and depreciation and amortization. The cash flows
and terminal value were then discounted to present value using a range of discount rates from 11.5% to 15.5%, based on an estimate
of Silver Spring’s weighted average cost of capital. Evercore estimated Silver Spring’s weighted average cost of capital based on
application of the capital asset pricing model and its professional judgment given the nature of Silver Spring’s business and its
industry. The resulting range of implied enterprise values for Silver Spring was then increased by the amount of Silver Spring’s net
cash (calculated as cash and cash equivalents less debt) as of June 30, 2017, and the present value of the savings generated from the
use of the tax attributes (based on assumptions provided by Silver Spring’s management), to produce a range of implied equity
values for Silver Spring. Under the perpetuity growth methodology for the street case forecasts, Evercore’s discounted cash flow
analysis indicated an implied per-share equity value for Silver Spring on a standalone basis of approximately $3.22 to $4.15. Under
the perpetuity growth methodology for the management case forecasts, Evercore’s discounted cash flow analysis indicated an
implied per-share equity value for Silver Spring on a standalone basis of approximately $4.16 to $6.42.

Under the terminal value multiple methodology, Evercore estimated a terminal value for Silver Spring by applying a multiple range
of 8.0x to 14.0x to the projected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense,
which we refer to as “adjusted EBITDA,” of Silver Spring for the one-year period ended December 31, 2021. Evercore estimated
the terminal value multiple based on the financial forecasts included in each of the management case forecasts and the street case
forecasts, the trading multiples for the companies included in the selected publicly traded companies analysis described below, and
its professional judgment given the nature of Silver Spring and its business and industry. The cash flows and terminal value were
then discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates as described above, and converted to implied equity value
using the same adjustments as described above. Under the terminal value multiple methodology for the street case forecasts,
Evercore’s discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied per share equity value for Silver Spring on a standalone basis of
approximately $6.40 to $10.63. Under the terminal value multiple methodology for the management case forecasts, Evercore’s
discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied per share equity value for Silver Spring on a standalone basis of approximately
$8.67 to $15.11.

Evercore compared the results of this analysis to the merger consideration.

Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price

Evercore performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future price per share of Silver Spring common stock,
which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future

49



9/22/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180079/000156761917002340/s001946x2_defm14a.htm

TABLE OF CONTENTS

value of a company’s equity as a function of that company’s estimated earnings per share, which we refer to as “EPS,” and its
assumed price to future EPS multiple. For this analysis, Evercore used the projected financial data for fiscal years 2017, 2018, 2019
and 2020 included in each of the management case forecasts and the street case forecasts.

In calculating the implied present value of the future price per share of Silver Spring common stock, Evercore first calculated the
implied future price per share of Silver Spring common stock by multiplying the estimated fiscal year 2020 EPS by Silver Spring’s
assumed price to earnings ratio, which we refer to as “P/E ratio,” of 20.0x for the next 12 months, which we refer to as the “NTM
period.” Evercore then discounted the implied total share price back to June 30, 2017, using a discount rate of 13.5%, which reflects
an estimate of Silver Spring’s cost of equity. This analysis resulted in an implied present value per share of Silver Spring common
stock of $6.67 based on the street case forecasts and $12.34 based on the management case forecasts. Allowing for sensitivity in the
assumed P/E ratio for the NTM period ranging between 16.0.x and 24.0x and the cost of equity ranging between 11.5% and 15.5%,
this analysis resulted in a range of implied present values per share of Silver Spring common stock of (1) $5.11 to $8.37 based on
the street case forecasts and (2) $9.45 to $15.48 based on the management case forecasts.

Precedent Transactions Analysis

Evercore reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to 29 precedent transactions involving companies
that Evercore considered to be relevant to Silver Spring’s business and industry, which we refer to as the “precedent transactions.”
Evercore selected the precedent transactions because they represented transactions of which Evercore was aware that were
announced between May 2011 and June 2017 involving companies in the meter and smart grid, networking and IoT verticals.
Evercore considered, in its professional judgment and experience, these transactions most relevant to the merger. No company,
business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Silver Spring or the merger. Accordingly, an
evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the relative values of
the selected companies.

The precedent transactions are set forth in the table below:

For each of the precedent transactions, using publicly available information, Evercore reviewed transaction values and calculated
the transaction total enterprise value, which we refer to as “transaction TEV,” implied for each target company based on the
consideration paid in the precedent transaction as a multiple of the target company’s trailing last 12 months’, which we refer to as
“LTM,” revenue (in each case, calculated for the 12-month period prior to the latest available data preceding the date of
announcement of such transaction).

Evercore calculated and analyzed the transaction TEV to LTM revenue multiples of the precedent transactions. This analysis
indicated the following:
Metric High Mean Median Low
Transaction TEV / LTM Revenue  13.1x  4.0x  3.2x  0.8x 

Meter & Smart Grid  3.5x  2.0x  1.8x  0.8x 
Networking  9.3x  3.4x  2.6x  1.4x 
Internet of Things  13.1x  5.7x  4.5x  2.8x 

Based on the multiples it derived for the precedent transactions and based on its professional judgment and experience, Evercore
applied a transaction TEV to LTM revenue multiple reference range of 1.50x to 3.50x to Silver Spring’s billings for Silver Spring’s
LTM period as of June 30, 2017. This analysis implied an equity value range per share of Silver Spring common stock of $9.79 to
$19.88. Evercore compared the results of this analysis to the merger consideration.

Although the precedent transactions were used for comparison purposes, none of those transactions is identical or directly
comparable to the merger, and none of the target companies in the precedent transactions is identical or directly comparable to
Silver Spring. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Silver Spring, such as the
impact of competition on the business of Silver Spring and the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse
material change in the financial conditions and prospects of Silver Spring, the industry or in the financial markets in general.
Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the transaction data of
the precedent transactions.

Peer Group Trading Multiples Analysis

Evercore reviewed and compared certain financial and operating information relating to Silver Spring to the following companies:

Meter & Smart Grid
Enterprise & Carrier

Networking Internet of Things
High Growth

Networking/Security
• Xylem • Cisco • PTC • Arista
• Itron • Nokia • Telit Communications • Palo Alto Networks
• Landis + Gyr • Ericsson   • Fortinet
• ESCO Technologies • Juniper   • Ubiquiti Networks
• Badger Meter • F5 Networks   • FireEye
• CalAmp • ARRIS International   • Gigamon
• Ameresco • Ciena     
  • Infinera     
  • ADTRAN     

Although none of these companies are directly comparable to Silver Spring, Evercore selected the companies for the peer group
trading multiple analysis based on its professional judgment because these companies had operating characteristics, products and
services that, for purposes of its analysis, Evercore considered similar to certain of Silver Spring’s operating characteristics,
products and services.

For each of the selected companies identified above, Evercore calculated multiples of TEV to estimated revenue for calendar years
2017 and 2018 based on closing stock prices as of September 15, 2017, and financial data that Evercore obtained from filings made
with the SEC and consensus estimates based on publicly available equity research analysts’ projections.

The analysis indicated the following with respect to the peer group:
Metric High Mean Median Low
TEV / 2017E Revenue             

Meter & Smart Grid  3.4x  2.2x  2.3x  0.7x

High Growth Networking/Security  6.7x  4.7x  4.3x  3.4x 

Based upon the information presented in the tables above and the application of Evercore’s professional judgment, Evercore
selected a reference multiple range of 1.50x to 2.50x for each of the street case forecasts and the management case forecasts. The
range was then applied to Silver Spring’s projected billings for fiscal years 2017 and 2018, as estimated in the street case forecasts
and the management case forecasts. Evercore determined an implied equity value per share range of $9.93 per share to $15.14 per
share and $10.16 per share to $15.51 per share for fiscal year 2017 based on the street case forecasts and the management case
forecasts, respectively. Separately, Evercore determined an implied equity value per share range of $9.21 per share to $14.90 per
share and $9.67 per share to $15.70 per share for fiscal year 2018 based on the street case forecasts and the management case
forecasts, respectively.

Evercore compared the results of this analysis to the merger consideration.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Premiums Paid Analysis

Using publicly available information, Evercore reviewed 145 technology, media and telecom transactions and announced bids for
control of U.S. public targets with an aggregate transaction value between $500 million and $1.5 billion announced through
September 15, 2017. Using publicly available information, Evercore calculated the premiums paid as the percentage by which the
per share consideration paid in each such transaction exceeded the closing market share prices of the target companies one day, one
week and four weeks prior to announcement of each transaction.

 
1 Day

Median  30%  32%  36%
Mean  32%  35%  39%
75th Percentile  41%  43%  47%

Based on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment, Evercore applied a premium range of 20% to 50% to the closing
price per share of Silver Spring common stock of $13.00 as of September 15, 2017, which resulted in an implied value range of
$15.60 to $19.50 per share.

Evercore compared the results of this analysis to the merger consideration.

Historical Trading Range Analysis

Evercore reviewed, for reference and informational purposes only, historical trading prices of shares of Silver Spring common stock
during the 52-week period ended September 15, 2017. Evercore noted that the low and high closing prices during such period
ranged from $9.82 to $15.39 per share of Silver Spring common stock, as compared to the merger consideration.

Analyst Price Targets Analysis

Evercore reviewed, for reference and informational purposes only, publicly available share price targets of research analysts’
estimates known to Evercore as of September 15, 2017, noting that the low and high share price targets ranged from $11.00 to
$19.00 per share of Silver Spring common stock, as compared to the merger consideration.

General

In connection with the review of the merger by the Silver Spring board of directors, Evercore performed a variety of financial and
comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process
involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analyses and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore’s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the
results of all the analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by
it for purposes of its opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional
judgment after considering the results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have considered various assumptions more or
less probable than other assumptions, so that the range of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should
therefore not be taken to be Evercore’s view of the value of Silver Spring. No company used in the above analyses as a comparison
is directly comparable to Silver Spring, and no transaction used is directly comparable to the merger. Further, Evercore’s analyses
involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect
the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies or transactions used, including judgments and assumptions with
regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of Silver Spring or its advisors. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not equaling the total
of the figures shown.

Evercore prepared these analyses solely for the purpose of providing an opinion to the Silver Spring board of directors as to the
fairness of the merger consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Silver

Spring common stock entitled to receive such merger consideration. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals of Silver Spring
or to necessarily reflect the prices at which Silver Spring or its securities actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these
analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by such estimates. Accordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses are inherently subject
to substantial uncertainty, and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted in
such estimates. The issuance of the fairness opinion was approved by an opinion committee of Evercore.

Evercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Silver Spring board of directors or management or that any
specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the transaction for the holders of Silver Spring
common stock.

Miscellaneous

Under the terms of Evercore’s engagement, Evercore has provided Silver Spring with financial advisory services and delivered a
written fairness opinion to the Silver Spring board of directors in connection with the merger. Pursuant to the terms of its
engagement letter, Evercore is entitled to receive (1) an opinion fee of $1.5 million, regardless of the conclusion reached therein,
which was earned upon delivery of its fairness opinion and which is fully creditable, to the extent previously paid, against any
transaction fee payable and (2) a transaction fee, comprised of a success fee and a discretionary component, currently estimated to
total approximately $9.4 million, which Evercore will earn subject to and upon the consummation of the merger. In addition, Silver
Spring has agreed to reimburse Evercore for its expenses (including external legal fees, expenses and disbursements) incurred in
connection with its engagement and to indemnify Evercore and any of its members, partners, officers, directors, advisors,
representatives, employees, agents, affiliates or controlling persons, if any, against certain liabilities and expenses arising out of
Evercore’s engagement, any services performed by Evercore in connection therewith or any transaction contemplated thereby.

During the two-year period prior to the date of Evercore’s opinion, no material relationship existed between Evercore and its
affiliates and Itron or Silver Spring pursuant to which compensation was received by Evercore or its affiliates as a result of such
relationship. Evercore or its affiliates may provide financial or other services to Silver Spring in the future and in connection with
any such services, Evercore and its affiliates may receive compensation.

In the ordinary course of business, Evercore or its affiliates may actively trade the securities, or related derivative securities, or
financial instruments of Silver Spring, Itron and their respective affiliates for its own account and for the accounts of its customers
and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or instruments.

The Silver Spring board of directors engaged Evercore to act as its financial advisor based on its qualifications, experience and
reputation. Evercore is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of
businesses in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, competitive biddings, private placements and valuations
for corporate and other purposes.

Certain Prospective Financial Information Reviewed by the Silver Spring Board of Directors and Silver Spring’s Financial
Advisor

Management Case Forecasts

Although Silver Spring has publicly issued limited projections concerning various aspects of its expected financial performance,
Silver Spring does not make public disclosure of detailed forecasts or projections of its expected financial performance for extended
periods because of, among other things, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and
the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may prove incorrect.

In evaluating a possible transaction with Itron, Silver Spring management provided financial forecasts for the fiscal years ending
December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2020 to the Silver Spring board of directors, Itron and Evercore prior to the execution of
the merger agreement. The Silver Spring board of directors and Evercore were also provided with extrapolations derived from such
financial forecasts for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 (we refer to such financial forecasts, together with the
extrapolations derived therefrom, as the management case forecasts).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Street Case Forecasts

The Silver Spring board of directors and Evercore also reviewed certain financial forecasts created using averages of publicly-
available research analysts’ estimates for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, and extrapolations
derived therefrom, for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2021 (we refer to such financial forecasts,
together with the extrapolations derived therefrom, as the street case forecasts). The street case forecasts included extrapolated
financial forecasts for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2021 created by projecting trends, with
adjustments, observed in the research analysts’ estimates utilized in preparing the financial forecasts used for the fiscal years ending
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. The street case forecasts are based solely on the mathematical aggregation of publicly
available information prepared by third-party research analysts. The research analysts’ estimates utilized in the street case forecasts:
(1) were not prepared with any input from Silver Spring management, (2) do not reflect all potentially relevant information available
to Silver Spring management and (3) do not reflect any exercise of judgment by Silver Spring management. As such, the inclusion
of the street case forecasts in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that Silver Spring, the Silver Spring board
of directors, its advisors, or any other person considered, or now considers, the street case forecasts to be a reliable prediction of
actual future results.

Additional Information Concerning the Management Case Forecasts and the Street Case Forecasts

Summaries of the Management Case Forecasts and the Street Case Forecasts (which we refer to collectively as the “financial
forecasts”) are included in this proxy statement. You should note that the financial forecasts constitute forward-looking statements.
See “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information” on page 23 of this proxy statement. The financial forecasts
were not prepared for public disclosure or to influence Silver Spring’s stockholders’ views of the proposed merger. Nonetheless,
summaries of the financial forecasts are provided in this proxy statement only because the financial forecasts were made available to
the Silver Spring board of directors, Itron and Evercore in evaluating a potential transaction with Itron. There can be no assurance
that the financial forecasts will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected. The
financial forecasts are highly subjective in many respects and cover five years, and such information by its nature is inherently
uncertain and becomes subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. Economic and business environments, as well as
foreign exchange rates, can and do change quickly, which adds an additional significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results
portrayed in the financial forecasts will be achieved. The inclusion of the financial forecasts in this proxy statement does not
constitute an admission or representation by Silver Spring that the information is material.

In addition, the financial forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward complying with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States, which we refer to as “GAAP,” the published guidelines of the SEC regarding
projections and the use of non-GAAP financial measures, or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. The presentation of this additional information is
not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The financial forecasts were
prepared using certain non-GAAP financial metrics, such as billings, unlevered free cash flow, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP
operating income, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income. Silver Spring believes that these non-GAAP financial metrics
offer valuable supplemental information regarding the performance of Silver Spring’s business, and will help investors better
understand the sales volumes and profitability trends, as well as the cash flow characteristics, of Silver Spring’s business. The non-
GAAP metrics should not be considered in isolation from, are not a substitute for, and do not purport to be an alternative to,
revenue, gross profit, operating income, operating expense, net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance
with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In
addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Silver Spring
believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with its results of
operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Neither Silver Spring’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any
other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the financial forecasts, nor
have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.

The financial forecasts were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and beyond the control of
Silver Spring. Silver Spring believes the assumptions that its management used as a basis

for the management case forecasts were reasonable at the time Silver Spring management prepared the management case forecasts,
reflected the best available estimates and judgments at the time, taking into account the relevant information available to Silver
Spring management at the time and presented at the time, to the best of Silver Spring management’s knowledge and belief, and
represent a reasonable projection of future financial performance of Silver Spring. Silver Spring management did not assess any of
the assumptions or estimates utilized by research analysts in preparing the publicly-available research analysts’ estimates upon
which the street case forecasts were based. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the financial forecasts not to be
achieved include: (1) general economic conditions, (2) the accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, (3) changes in actual or
projected cash flows, (4) competitive pressures and (5) changes in tax laws and (6) other factors described or referenced under
“Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information” beginning on page 23 of this proxy statement and in the risk
factors contained in Silver Spring’s periodic filings with the SEC. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the financial forecasts
will be realized or that future financial results will not materially vary from the financial forecasts, and the financial forecasts should
not be relied upon as being indicative of future results. You are cautioned not to rely on this forward-looking information.

The financial forecasts do not take into account the possible financial and other effects on Silver Spring of the merger, and do not
attempt to predict or suggest future results of the combined company. The financial forecasts do not give effect to the merger,
including the impact of negotiating or executing the merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with
consummating the merger, whether any synergies are achieved by the combined company as a result of the merger, the effect on
Silver Spring of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having
been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the merger
agreement had not been executed, but that were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger.
Further, the financial forecasts do not take into account the effect on Silver Spring of any possible failure of the merger to occur.

For the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held several months after the financial forecasts were
prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to
place unwarranted reliance on the financial forecasts set forth below. No one has made or makes any representation to any
stockholder regarding the information included in the financial forecasts. Silver Spring urges all Silver Spring stockholders to
review its most recent SEC filings for a description of its reported financial results. See “Where Stockholders Can Find More
Information” beginning on page 111 of this proxy statement.

In addition, the financial forecasts have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date the financial
forecasts were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, or to reflect financial targets issued by Silver Spring after the date
the financial forecasts were prepared, and except as required by applicable securities laws, Silver Spring does not intend to update or
otherwise revise the financial forecasts or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made
or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error.

The following is a summary of the management case forecasts prepared by Silver Spring management and provided to the Silver
Spring board of directors, Itron (other than forecasts of unlevered free cash flow and financial forecasts for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2021) and Evercore prior to the execution of the merger agreement:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The following is a summary of the street case forecasts provided to the Silver Spring board of directors prior to the execution of the
merger agreement:
 Fiscal Year Ending December 31
 ($ in millions)
 2017E 2018E 2019E 2020E 2021E

Non-GAAP Net Income  1  15  19  25  33 
Unlevered Free Cash Flow $ (6) $ (9) $ (2) $ 3 $ 7 

For purposes of the financial forecasts presented herein: (1) Billings represent amounts invoiced for products for which ownership,
typically evidenced by title and risk of loss, has transferred or services that have been provided to the customer, and for which
payment is expected to be made in accordance with normal payment terms. Billings exclude amounts for undelivered products,
services to be performed in the future, and amounts paid or payable to customers, (2) Non-GAAP Gross Profit is the difference
between Billings and cost of Billings, (3) Non-GAAP Operating Income is calculated as operating income adjusted for Billings and
cost of non-GAAP revenue and excludes expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation,
acquisition-related, (4) Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income adjusted for changes in deferred revenue and deferred cost of
revenue, other (income) expense, net, (benefit) provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based
compensation, acquisition-related charges, restructuring, legal settlements and certain other items management believes affect the
comparability of operating results, (5) Non-GAAP Net Income represents net income adjusted for changes in deferred revenue and
deferred cost of revenue, and excludes expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation,
acquisition-related charges, income tax benefit related to acquisitions, restructuring and legal settlements and (6) Unlevered Free
Cash Flow is calculated as earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, less income tax expense, capital expenditures, increases in
net working capital and certain other cash expenses, as applicable, plus depreciation and amortization. For fiscal year 2017 only,
Unlevered Cash Flow is calculated only with respect to the second half of such fiscal year. Calculations of Unlevered Free Cash
Flow were prepared by Evercore at the direction of Silver Spring, and were not provided to Itron. In addition, certain of the numbers
included in these financial forecasts have been rounded to the nearest million. Accordingly, any numerical discrepancies in the
foregoing tables between (i) totals and the sums of the amounts listed or (ii) totals and percentage margin, are, in each case, due to
rounding.

Financing of the Merger

On October 3, 2017, Itron entered into the amended commitment letter with the current commitment parties.

The provision of debt financing by the current commitment parties or any other person is not a condition to the closing of the
merger.

The financing under the amended commitment letter, which we refer to as the “financing,” provides for (i) senior secured credit
facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,125.0 million, which includes a new $400 million senior secured term loan B
facility, and (ii) a senior unsecured bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $350 million if Itron does not issue
senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of at least $350 million on or prior to the consummation of the merger.
The financing will be used to refinance Itron’s existing credit facilities, if necessary, and to finance, in part, Itron’s acquisition of
Silver Spring.

The obligations of the current commitment parties’ to provide the financing under the amended commitment letter are subject to a
number of conditions, including:

• the negotiation, execution and delivery of definitive documentation consistent with the amended commitment letter;

• the absence of a material adverse effect on Silver Spring since June 30, 2017;

• the consummation of the merger in accordance with the merger agreement;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• the delivery of certain pro forma and other financial information of Itron and Silver Spring;

• the accuracy of specified representations and warranties of Silver Spring in the merger agreement and specified
representations and warranties of Itron to be set forth in the definitive loan documents; and

• other customary closing conditions.

Itron and Merger Sub are required under the merger agreement to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the financing
on the terms, and subject only to the conditions described in, the amended commitment letter and any related fee letter. In the event
that any portion of the financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the amended commitment letter,
Itron is required to use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing for the amount of financing that is sufficient to fund (i)
the aggregate amount payable by Itron or Merger Sub pursuant to the merger agreement, (ii) all associated fees, costs and expenses
in connection with the merger, including the financing, (iii) the repayment of all outstanding borrowings and other payment
obligations under Itron’s existing credit agreement (if such repayment is necessary) and (iv) the repayment, retirement and
redemption in full of all indebtedness of Silver Spring and its subsidiaries (which aggregate amount in items (i)-(iv) we refer to as
the “required amount”). As of the last practicable date before the printing of this proxy statement, the amended commitment letter
remains in effect, and Itron has not notified Silver Spring of any plans to utilize financing in lieu of the financing described above.
The definitive documentation governing the financing contemplated by the amended commitment letter has not been finalized and,
accordingly, the actual terms of the financing may differ from those described in this proxy statement.

The commitments under the amended commitment letter will terminate at the earliest to occur of (i) the consummation of the
merger, (ii) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms and (iii) March 17, 2018, which we refer to as the
“end date;” provided that if the termination date under the merger agreement is extended pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, then the end date shall automatically be extended to June 17, 2018. For more information, see the section entitled “Terms
of the Merger Agreement—Financing and Financing Cooperation” beginning on page 95 of this proxy statement.

Interests of Silver Spring’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendation of the Silver Spring board of directors that Silver Spring stockholders approve the merger
proposal, Silver Spring stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of Silver Spring have certain interests
in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Silver Spring stockholders generally. The Silver Spring board of
directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in unanimously (i) determining that the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, were fair to, and in the best interests of, Silver Spring
and its stockholders, (ii) declaring advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger,
(iii) approving and authorizing the execution and delivery by Silver Spring of the merger agreement, the performance by Silver
Spring of its covenants and agreements contained therein, and the consummation of the merger and the transactions contemplated
thereby, (iv) resolving to recommend that Silver Spring stockholders vote in favor of the merger and adopt the merger agreement, all
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, and (v) to the extent permitted by applicable law,
electing that any “fair price,” “moratorium,” “control share acquisition,” “business combination,” or other anti-takeover statute or
similar statute or regulations of any jurisdiction that purports to be applicable to the merger, Silver Spring, the shares of Silver
Spring common stock, or the other transactions contemplated by the merger, shall not be applicable to the merger, Silver Spring, the
shares of Silver Spring common stock, or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Treatment of Options

Each vested option to purchase shares of Silver Spring common stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger and that has a per share exercise price that is less than the merger consideration will be cancelled at the effective
time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to such option and (ii) the excess of the merger consideration
over the per share exercise price under such option.

Each unvested option to purchase shares of Silver Spring common stock (other than an unvested option held by a non-employee
member of the Silver Spring board of directors) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

effective time of the merger, has a per share exercise price that is less than the merger consideration and is held by a then-current
service provider to Silver Spring, which we refer to as an “assumed option,” will be assumed by Itron at the effective time and
converted into and become an option to acquire Itron common stock, which we refer to as an “adjusted option,” on the same
material terms and conditions (including vesting) as were applicable under the corresponding assumed option immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger, as follows:

• the number of shares of Itron common stock subject to each adjusted option will be the number of shares of Silver Spring
common stock that were subject to the corresponding assumed option multiplied by an exchange ratio determined by
dividing the merger consideration by the volume-weighted average of the trading prices of shares of Itron common stock
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the ten trading days ending with, and including, the closing date of the merger,
which we refer to as the “exchange ratio,” rounded down to the nearest whole share of Itron common stock; and

• the per share exercise price for the Itron common stock issuable upon exercise of each adjusted option will be the
applicable per share exercise price of the corresponding assumed option divided by the exchange ratio, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent.

Any option to purchase Silver Spring common stock held by a non-employee member of the Silver Spring board of directors that is
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and that has a per share exercise price that is less than the merger
consideration, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled in exchange for an amount in cash, less applicable withholding taxes,
equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to such option and (ii) the excess
of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price under such option.

Each option to purchase shares of Silver Spring common stock, whether vested or unvested, that has a per share exercise price that
is equal to or greater than the merger consideration will, immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, become vested and
exercisable by the holder thereof, and each such option that remains unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
effective time will be cancelled at the effective time with no payment made therefor.

Treatment of Restricted Stock Units

Each Silver Spring restricted stock unit, which we refer to as an “RSU,” that remains outstanding and is fully vested as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled at the effective time and automatically converted into the
right to receive an amount of cash (less any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares
of Silver Spring common stock subject to such RSU and (ii) the merger consideration.

Each RSU (other than an unvested RSU held by a non-employee member of the Silver Spring board of directors) that remains
outstanding and is unvested as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and that is held by a then-current service
provider to Silver Spring (which we refer to as an “assumed RSU,” will be assumed by Itron at the effective time of the merger and
will be converted into a restricted stock unit to receive, on substantially the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as were
applicable under such assumed RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, a number of shares of Itron common
stock equal to the number of shares of Silver Spring common stock that were subject to such assumed RSU multiplied by the
exchange ratio and rounded down to the nearest whole share of Itron common stock.

Any RSU held by a non-employee member of the Silver Spring board of directors that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled at the effective time and converted into the right to
receive an amount of cash (less any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Silver Spring common stock subject to such RSU and (ii) the merger consideration.

Treatment of Performance Stock Units; Cancellation and Stay Bonus Agreements

Each PSU that was granted during 2015 and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
cancelled effective as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and will terminate without the payment of any
consideration therefor and the holders of such PSUs granted during 2015 will cease to have any rights with respect thereto. In

TABLE OF CONTENTS

related to the PSUs granted in 2015, we entered into Cancellation and Stay Bonus Agreements with certain of our executive officers.
Pursuant to these agreements, each such executive officer waived certain vesting and other provisions relating to PSUs granted in
2015 in consideration for a cash retention award that will be paid if the executive remains continuously employed with Silver Spring
through the closing of the merger. If an executive’s employment terminates for any reason prior to the date on which the merger
closes, the executive will not be entitled to the cash retention award or the benefit of the waived provisions with respect to such
PSUs. For more information, see the section entitled “Cancellation and Stay Bonus Agreements; Retention Agreements” beginning
on page 62 of this proxy statement.

For each PSU that was granted in 2017 and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, the
performance conditions will be deemed satisfied at 100% of the target level of achievement and (i) the portion of each such PSU
that is outstanding and unvested as to service-based vesting conditions will be treated as an assumed RSU and assumed by Itron as
described above, and (ii) the portion of each such PSU that is outstanding and vested as to both performance conditions and service-
based conditions will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount of cash (less any applicable
withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to such RSU
and (ii) the merger consideration.

Quantification of Outstanding Equity Awards

The following table sets forth, for each of Silver Spring’s directors and executive officers holding options, RSUs or PSUs as of
October 27, 2017, the last practicable date prior to filing this proxy statement, (i) the number of vested (and unvested, in the case of
non-employee directors) shares underlying options, RSUs and PSUs that will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a cash
payment at the effective time of the merger, (ii) the number of unvested shares underlying stock options, RSUs and PSUs (to the
extent they continue to be subject to service-based vesting) that will be assumed and converted into corresponding options and
restricted stock units of Itron at the effective time of the merger and (iii) the estimated values of each based on the value of the
merger consideration at $16.25 paid per share of Silver Spring common stock.

The table excludes options held by any of our directors and executive officers to purchase shares of Silver Spring common stock,
whether vested or unvested, that have a per share exercise price equal to, or greater than, the merger consideration. As noted above,
each such option will become vested and exercisable immediately prior to the merger, and each such option that remains
unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled at the effective time with no payment
made therefor.

assumed and converted into an option to purchase Itron common stock. The number of shares subject to the assumed option will be (i) the number of shares
subject to the corresponding option to purchase shares of Silver Spring common stock, multiplied by (ii) the exchange ratio. The exercise price of the assumed
option will be the exercise price of the corresponding unvested option to purchase Silver Spring common stock, divided by (ii) the exchange ratio. For non-
employee directors, unvested options will be cancelled at the effective time in exchange for the right to receive a cash amount equal to (A) the aggregate
number of shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to each option, multiplied by (B) the excess of $16.25 over the exercise price.

(3) Amounts reflected represent the number of shares of common stock subject to such RSUs, multiplied by merger consideration of $16.25 per share. For
executive officers, each RSU, to the extent unvested, will be assumed and converted into a restricted stock unit for Itron common stock. The number of shares
subject to each assumed restricted stock unit will be (i) the number of shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to the unvested restricted stock unit,
multiplied by (ii) the exchange ratio. For non-employee directors, unvested RSUs will be cancelled at the effective time in exchange for the right to receive a
cash amount equal to (A) the aggregate number of shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to each RSU, multiplied by (B) $16.25.

(4) In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, PSUs granted in 2015 will be cancelled immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. In
connection with the waiver of certain vesting and other provisions related to the PSUs granted in 2015, Silver Spring entered into Cancellation and Stay Bonus
Agreements pursuant to which certain executives are entitled to cash retention awards subject to their continued employment through the date on which the
merger closes. Amounts reflected in this column include the full value of such cash retention awards. See “—Stay Bonus Agreements” for additional
information. The performance-based vesting conditions subject to the PSUs granted in 2017 will be deemed satisfied at 100% of target level immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger. After giving effect to such deemed satisfaction of performance-based vesting conditions, to the extent any PSUs granted in
2017 are vested as to both performance-based vesting conditions and service-based vesting conditions, such awards will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive cash consideration equal to (i) the aggregate number of shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to such PSUs multiplied by (ii) $16.25.
To the extent any PSUs granted in 2017 remain subject to service-based vesting conditions, such awards will be assumed and converted into RSUs in respect of
Itron common stock equal to the number of shares of Silver Spring common subject to such PSU, multiplied by the exchange ratio.

(5) As of March 27, 2017, Mr. Gianella ceased serving as our interim Chief Financial Officer and assumed the role of Senior Vice President, Finance.

James Burns served as Silver Spring’s Chief Financial Officer for a portion of 2016 and ceased to be employed by Silver Spring in
June 2016. Mr. Dresselhuys served as Silver Spring’s Executive Vice President, Global Sales and Development through 2016 and a
portion of 2017, and ceased to be employed by Silver Spring in March 2017. Mr. Burns and Mr. Dresselhuys do not hold any equity
awards of Silver Spring nor are they entitled to any benefits as part of the merger, other than with respect to any shares of Silver
Spring common stock which each may hold. As of Mr. Burns’ last day of employment, he held 31,162 shares of Silver Spring
common stock. As of Mr. Dresselhuys’ last day of employment, he held 76,163 shares of Silver Spring common stock.

Quantification of Silver Spring Common Stock Consideration

The following table sets forth the estimated amounts each executive officer and director of Silver Spring will be eligible to receive
in connection with the merger, based on the number of shares of outstanding common stock held by each such individuals as of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2017 Bonus Incentives

Each of Silver Spring’s executive officers is a participant in Silver Spring’s 2017 Annual Bonus Plan, which we refer to in this
proxy statement as the “2017 Bonus Plan,” which consists of one 12-month performance period from January 1, 2017, to December
31, 2017. In the absence of the merger, the bonus pool for the 12-month performance period would be funded based on Silver
Spring’s actual performance as measured against three corporate financial and strategic objectives. These objectives (bookings,
billings and non-GAAP operating income) fund the bonus pool on a sliding scale between a threshold 80% and target 100% level of
achievement.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Silver Spring may make payments in respect of the 2017 Bonus Plan as if the applicable targets
were fully achieved at target levels on the earlier of (i) the payroll date of the last regularly scheduled pay period of the 2017
calendar year and (ii) the payroll date of the last regularly scheduled pay period prior to the closing of the merger. To the extent that
Silver Spring has not made a determination with respect to, and paid the bonus amounts due pursuant to the 2017 Bonus Plan prior
to the closing of the merger, then such bonuses will become payable at target levels.

The table below sets forth the estimated value that each Silver Spring executive officer will be paid under the 2017 Bonus Plan,
assuming performance achievement at target levels and, as applicable, such executive’s continued employment through the date of
payment.

Cancellation and Stay Bonus Agreements; Retention Agreements

In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Silver Spring entered into Cancellation and Stay Bonus Agreements
(which we refer to as the “Stay Bonus Agreements”) with Messrs. Bell, Arnold, Lang, Reeves and Vaswani and Ms. Stynes.
Pursuant to the terms of the Stay Bonus Agreements, and in connection with each such executive’s waiver of certain vesting and
other provisions relating to the PSUs granted in 2015, each executive will become entitled to a cash retention award subject to such
executive’s continued employment by Silver Spring until the closing of the merger. Ms. Stynes will be eligible to receive a portion
of her cash retention award on the earlier of December 29, 2017 and the closing of the merger, subject to her continued employment
on such date as set forth below.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In addition, pursuant to a retention agreement entered into between Mr. Gianella and Silver Spring in March 2017, Mr. Gianella will
become entitled to receive $100,000, subject to his continued employment by Silver Spring until the earliest of (i) March 30, 2018,
(ii) the consummation of the merger, and (iii) Mr. Gianella’s termination without “cause,” as such term is defined in his termination
benefits agreement described below.

Executive Officer Severance

In connection with the merger, and pursuant to their employment agreements, termination benefits agreements, employment offer
letters and equity award agreements with Silver Spring, certain executive officers are entitled to receive accelerated vesting of their
equity awards and/or enhanced severance payments upon qualifying terminations of employment during a specified period before
and after the closing of the merger.

In the event of a termination of employment by Silver Spring without “cause” (as defined in the applicable executive officer
agreements) or a “constructive termination” (as defined in the applicable executive officer agreements) at any time for Mr. Lang, or
within the two-month period prior to, or the 12-month period following, the merger for all other executive officers, then subject to
the executive’s timely execution, delivery and non-revocation of a general release of claims, each of Messrs. Bell, Gaglione, Arnold,
Gianella, Lang, Reeves and Vaswani, and Mses. Ildeniz, Fallon and Stynes would be entitled to receive (i) cash severance payments
by Silver Spring (or its successor) in an amount equal to the executive’s base salary as then in effect, for six months in the case of
Mr. Gianella, and 12 months in the case of all other executive officers, (ii) a prorated portion of the actual bonus that the executive
would have earned for the year in which they were terminated, and (iii) reimbursement for expenses incurred to obtain continuing
medical (including dental, optical and mental health) insurance benefits for the executive and the executive’s family until the earlier
of (A) six months in the case of Mr. Gianella, and 12 months in the case of all other executive officers, following the executive’s
termination and (B) the date the executive officer commences employment with another entity. In each case, the first payment, equal
to three months’ base salary, would be made no later than the 60th day following the executive’s termination, and the additional
payments would continue in monthly installments thereafter.

In addition, each of the executive officers would be entitled to receive accelerated vesting of any then-outstanding unvested stock
options, RSUs and PSUs (but only to the extent that any performance-based vesting conditions had been satisfied prior to the date of
termination) (i) in the case of each executive officer other than Mr. Gianella, with respect to 100% of the unvested shares of Silver
Spring common stock underlying such awards and (ii) in the case of Mr. Gianella, with respect to 50% of the unvested shares of
Silver Spring common stock underlying such awards. In each of the foregoing cases other than with respect to Mr. Lang, Itron may
require the executive officer to continue employment for a three-month transition period before any such severance benefits are
paid.

Our applicable agreements with our executive officers also contain certain provisions, which we refer to as “excise tax provisions,”
providing that if the severance and other benefits provided to any such executive under the applicable agreement or otherwise would
constitute “excess parachute payments” as defined under Section 280G and would be subject to excise tax imposed by Section 4999
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the “Code”), the executive would be entitled to receive the
greater of (as determined on an after-tax basis): (i) full payment of such payments and benefits or (ii) such lesser amount as would
result in no portion of those payments and benefits being subject to the excise tax. See “—Quantification of Potential Payments to
Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” below for additional information regarding the potential severance entitlements
described above.

For purposes of the applicable executive officer agreements described above, “constructive termination” generally means an
executive officer’s resignation after the occurrence of any of the following events without the executive’s prior consent: (i) a
material reduction in the executive’s job duties and responsibilities (and (A) in the case of Messrs. Vaswani and Gianella, a material
change to such executive’s title and (B) in the case of Mr. Lang, a material change to his title of Executive Chairman or removal
from the Silver Spring board of directors); (ii) a relocation to a work facility or location that is more than 35 miles from the primary
location at which the executive was working immediately prior to such change; (iii) a reduction of base salary (other than as part of
an across-the-board, proportional reduction); or (iv) the failure of a successor to assume the applicable executive officer agreement;
provided in each case that the executive officer is required to provide 90 days’ notice of the occurrence of any of the foregoing
conditions and provide Silver Spring (or any successor) 30 days

to cure the condition. If Silver Spring (or any successor) fails to cure such condition, the executive officer must terminate
employment within 30 days after the expiration of the cure period.

For purposes of the applicable executive officer agreements described above, “cause” generally means (i) material failure of the
executive to perform her his or duties and responsibilities, including any failure to cooperate in any investigation or formal
proceeding; (ii) the executive’s commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement, dishonesty or any other intentional misconduct that
results in material injury to the company; (iii) the unauthorized use or disclosure by the executive of any proprietary information or
trade secrets of the company; (iv) a conviction of, or no contest plea entered by, the executive to a felony; or (v) the executive’s
willful, wrongful and uncured breach of any of the executive’s obligations under any policy of Silver Spring or written agreement or
covenant with Silver Spring.

Quantification of Potential Payments to Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger

The table below sets forth information about certain compensation for each of Silver Spring’s named executive officers that is based
on or otherwise relates to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Silver Spring’s named executive officers are (i)
Michael Bell, President and Chief Executive Officer, (ii) Philippe Gaglione, Executive Vice President, Research and Development
and (iii) Aysegul Ildeniz, Chief Operating Officer.

Please note that the amounts reported below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually reflect future
facts. As a result, the actual merger-related compensation to be received by any named executive officer may differ in material
respects from the amounts set forth below. Furthermore, for purposes of calculating such amounts, Silver Spring has assumed:

• The merger was consummated on October 27, 2017, which is used because it is the latest practicable date prior to filing of
this Proxy Statement;

• Each named executive officer’s employment was terminated without “cause” or experiences a “constructive termination”
immediately following the closing of the merger, entitling the named executive officer to receive the payments and
benefits under the terms of such named executive officer’s termination benefits agreements, employment offer letters and
equity award agreements;

• The price per share of Silver Spring common stock paid in connection with the merger was $16.25; and

• No reductions of any payments or benefits were triggered pursuant to excise tax provisions in any named executive
officer’s applicable employment agreement.

Named Executive Officer Cash(1) Equity(2) Other(3) Total
Michael Bell $ 1,050,000 $ 4,286,269 $ 32,093 $ 5,368,362 
Philippe Gaglione $ 637,500 $ 2,338,969 $ 32,296 $ 3,008,765 
Aysegul Ildeniz $ 850,000 $ 1,840,379 $ 10,657 $ 2,701,036 

(1) Amounts in this column include cash payments to each of the named executive officers in respect of (i) “single-trigger” 2017 bonus payments and (ii)
severance payments upon a qualifying “double-trigger” termination, each as described below and above in “—Executive Officer Severance,” “—Cancellation
and Stay Bonus Agreements,” and “—2017 Bonus Incentives”).
Upon consummation of the merger and subject to the named executive officer’s continued employment through such date (a “single-trigger” event), to the
extent that Silver Spring has not made a determination with respect to, and paid the bonus amounts due pursuant to the 2017 Bonus Plan, then such bonuses
will become payable at target levels.
Pursuant to his or her arrangements with Silver Spring, each named executive officer would be entitled to receive certain cash severance payments if such
executive experienced a termination of employment without “cause” or a “constructive termination” (each as defined in his or her applicable agreement with
Silver Spring) within the two-month period prior to, or the 12-month period following, the merger (a “double-trigger termination”), subject to the named
executive officer’s timely execution, delivery and non-revocation of a general release of claims. The severance amount constitutes cash payments by Silver
Spring (or its successor) equal to (i) the named executive officer’s base salary as then in effect for 12 months plus (ii) a prorated portion of the actual bonus
that the executive would have earned in the year of termination. The first payment, equal to three months’ base salary, would be made no later than the 60th
day following the executive’s termination, and the additional payments would continue in monthly installments thereafter. No separate prorated bonus was
included in the calculation of severance payments upon a double trigger termination as of October 27, 2017, because we have assumed pursuant to the merger
agreement that each named executive officer would receive payment under the

2017 Bonus Plan at target levels as described above. Ms. Ildeniz’s bonus also includes amounts payable pursuant to her participation in our sales incentive
compensation plan, assuming achievement at target levels without giving effect to any applicable pro-ration. To the extent the merger is consummated in 2018,
upon a double-trigger termination each named executive officer may also receive a pro-rated bonus for amounts actually earned during that year.
The following table separately quantifies the value of the 2017 bonus and the cash severance the named executive officers would become entitled to receive:

Michael Bell $ 525,000 $ 525,000 $ 1,050,000 
Philippe Gaglione $ 212,500 $ 425,000 $ 637,500 
Aysegul Ildeniz $ 425,000 $ 425,000 $ 850,000 

(2) Amounts reflected in this column include (i) “single-trigger” payments in respect of PSUs granted to Mr. Bell in 2015 and (ii) the value of acceleration of
unvested equity awards upon a qualifying “double-trigger” termination, each as described below.
In connection with his waiver of certain vesting and other provisions related to PSUs granted to Mr. Bell in 2015, Silver Spring entered into a Stay Bonus
Agreement with Mr. Bell. The Stay Bonus Agreement provides for a cash retention award of $203,125, due upon the closing of the merger, subject to Mr.
Bell’s continued employment by Silver Spring at such time. In connection with the merger, performance-based vesting conditions applicable to PSUs granted
to the named executive officers in 2017 would be deemed satisfied at 100% of the target level immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. Each such
award would be assumed and converted into restricted stock units to acquire shares of Itron common stock and continue to be subject to service-based vesting
conditions before any portion thereof would become exercisable.
Pursuant to the terms of their respective employment arrangements, upon a qualifying “double-trigger” termination, each named executive officer would be
entitled to 100% acceleration of any then-outstanding unvested stock options, RSUs and PSUs (including service-based vesting conditions in respect of PSUs
granted in 2017, after giving effect to the deemed satisfaction of performance conditions at target-level), with respect the shares of Silver Spring common stock
underlying such awards. The amounts included in this column reflect (i) the number of unvested shares underlying such awards as of the assumed closing date
multiplied by (ii) the excess of $16.25 over the exercise price (as applicable). For purposes of the foregoing calculations, we have assumed that each named
executive officer will experience a qualifying termination immediately following the effective time of the merger.
Amounts reflected exclude the value of previously vested options and RSUs held by executive officers which will be cancelled in exchange for cash payment
as described in the section entitled “—Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards.”

(3) Pursuant the terms and conditions of their respective employment arrangements, upon a “double-trigger” qualifying termination, each named executive officer
would be entitled to receive reimbursement by Silver Spring for expenses incurred for continuing medical insurance benefits for such named executive officer
and his or her family for up to 12 months following the date of termination. Amounts in this column reflect estimates based on current costs and insurance
premiums.

Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers

The terms of the merger agreement provide for certain post-closing covenants related to insurance and indemnification of directors
and executive officers. For a description of such covenants please see the section below entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—
Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance” beginning on page 96 of this proxy statement.

Benefit Arrangements with the Surviving Corporation

The term of the merger agreement provide for certain post-closing covenants related to employee benefit arrangements. For a
description of such covenants please see the section below titled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Employee Benefits Matters”
beginning on page 95 of this proxy statement.

Regulatory Approvals

The HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder require that Silver Spring and Itron file notification and report
forms with respect to the merger with the DOJ and the FTC and observe a waiting period before consummating the merger. The
required notification and report forms under the HSR Act have been filed with the DOJ and the FTC by Silver Spring and Itron.

At any time before or after the consummation of the merger, the DOJ, the FTC, a U.S. state or a foreign governmental authority with
jurisdiction over the parties could take such action under antitrust laws as it deems

necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the merger, to rescind the merger or to
seek divestiture of particular assets. Private parties also may seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances. Although there is no assurance that they will not do so, we do not expect any regulatory authority, state or private
party to take legal action under the antitrust laws.

Delisting and Deregistration of Silver Spring Common Stock

Silver Spring common stock is registered as a class of equity securities under the Exchange Act and is quoted on the NYSE under
the symbol “SSNI.” As a result of the merger, Silver Spring will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Itron. After the merger,
shares of Silver Spring common stock will cease to be traded on the NYSE and price quotations with respect to sales of shares of
Silver Spring common stock in the public market will no longer be available. In addition, Silver Spring will no longer be required to
file periodic reports with the SEC after the effective time of the merger with respect to Silver Spring common stock.

Consequences if the Merger is Not Consummated

If the stockholders do not vote to approve the merger proposal, or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason,
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Silver Spring common stock in connection with the merger. Instead,
shares of Silver Spring common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. In certain circumstances, we may be
required to pay a termination fee, or we or Itron may seek damages or other remedies, in each case, as described under the section
entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Termination; Effect of Termination” and “Terms of the Merger Agreement—Termination
Fee” beginning on page 99 and page 101, respectively, of this proxy statement.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following summary is a general discussion of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to “U.S.
holders” and “non-U.S. holders” (in each case, as defined below, and collectively, the “holders”) of Silver Spring common stock
whose shares of Silver Spring common stock are converted into the right to receive the merger consideration in the merger. This
summary is based on the current provisions of the Code, applicable Treasury regulations, judicial authority and administrative
rulings, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the “IRS,” and other applicable authorities, all as
currently in effect and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such
change could alter the tax consequences to the holders as described herein. No ruling from the IRS has been or will be sought with
respect to any aspect of the merger. This summary is for the general information of the holders only and does not purport to be a
complete analysis of all potential tax effects of the merger. For example, this summary does not address the effect of any applicable
state, local or foreign income tax laws, any non-income tax laws or the Medicare contribution tax. In addition, this discussion does
not address the tax consequences of transactions effectuated in connection with the consummation of the merger, including, without
limitation, the tax consequences to holders of stock options issued by us or other compensation arrangements which are cancelled or
converted, as the case may be, in connection with the merger. This discussion is not binding on the IRS or the courts and, therefore,
could be subject to challenge and ultimately sustained. Furthermore, this summary applies only to holders that hold Silver Spring
common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In
addition, this discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in
light of the holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as:

• broker-dealers;

• taxpayers that have elected the mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to their Silver Spring common
stock;

• persons holding Silver Spring common stock as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, short-sale, conversion transaction,
integrated transaction, synthetic security or constructive sale transaction;

• U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

• persons who acquired Silver Spring common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or in other
compensatory transactions or who hold Silver Spring common stock that is subject to vesting restrictions;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• persons who hold their Silver Spring common stock as qualified small business stock for purposes of Section 1045 and/or
Section 1202 of the Code;

• qualified retirement plans, individual retirement accounts, and other tax-deferred accounts;

• banks, insurance companies, mutual funds and other financial institutions;

• insurance companies;

• regulated investment companies;

• real estate investment trusts;

• certain former citizens or residents of the U.S.;

• holders who exercise appraisal rights;

• governmental agencies or instrumentalities;

• entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or holders that hold their Silver Spring common stock
through entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

• tax-exempt entities; or

• persons liable for the U.S. alternative minimum tax.

If a partnership, or other entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds Silver Spring common
stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding Silver Spring common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult their
tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to them.

U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Silver Spring common stock that is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:

• an individual citizen or resident of the United States.;

• a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for such purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United
States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

• a trust (i) if the administration thereof is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States, and one or
more United States persons (as defined in the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or
(ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person (as
defined in the Code).

The receipt of cash for shares of Silver Spring common stock in the merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder whose shares of Silver Spring common stock are converted into the right to
receive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received in exchange for such shares of Silver Spring common stock and the U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares of Silver Spring common stock. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Silver Spring
common stock generally will equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares of Silver Spring common stock. Gain or loss will
be determined separately for each block of shares of Silver Spring common stock (i.e., shares of Silver Spring common stock
acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain or loss generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the
U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of Silver Spring common stock exceeds one year at the time of the consummation of the
merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates
compared to short-term capital gains or ordinary income. In addition, depending on the effective time of the merger and a U.S.
holder’s particular circumstances, a U.S. holder may also be subject to an additional 3.8% net investment income tax. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Non-U.S. Holders

A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of Silver Spring common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is not a U.S.
holder or a partnership (or other entity classified as a partnership for such purposes). Payments made to a non-U.S. holder in
exchange for shares of Silver Spring common stock pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax
unless:

• the gain, if any, on such shares of Silver Spring common stock is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-
U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s
permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States); or

• the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the
exchange of shares of Silver Spring common stock for cash pursuant to the merger and certain other conditions are met.

Gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates. Any gain
described in the first bullet point above of a non-U.S. holder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to an additional
“branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or lower applicable treaty rate) on its “effectively connected earnings and profits” for the taxable
year, subject to certain adjustments. A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax
at a rate of 30% (or a lower applicable treaty rate) on any gain realized, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses
recognized in the same taxable year.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Payments made in exchange for shares of Silver Spring common stock generally will be subject to information reporting unless the
holder is an “exempt recipient” and may also be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%). To avoid backup
withholding, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption should properly complete and return IRS Form W-9,
certifying that such U.S. holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and such U.S. holder is not
subject to backup withholding. A non-U.S. holder that provides the applicable withholding agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN, W-
8BEN-E or W-8ECI, as appropriate, will generally establish an exemption from backup withholding.

Generally, information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to a payment of disposition proceeds to a non-U.S. holder
where the transaction is effected outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a broker. However, for information reporting
purposes, dispositions effected through a non-U.S. office of a broker with certain connections with the United States will be treated
in a manner similar to dispositions effected through a U.S. office of a broker. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them.

Copies of information returns may be made available to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is
incorporated under the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement.

Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited against a holder’s
U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the relevant information is timely furnished to the IRS.

This discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is for general information only and is not tax advice.
We urge you to consult your tax advisors with respect to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to your
particular situation, as well as any tax consequences of the merger arising under the federal estate or gift tax rules or under
any state, local or foreign tax laws or any non-income tax laws or under any applicable tax treaty.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

On November 9, 2017, James Geller, a purported stockholder of Silver Spring, filed a putative stockholder class action complaint in
the United States District Court in the Northern District of California against Silver Spring and the individual members of the Silver
Spring board of directors, captioned Geller v. Silver Spring Networks, Inc., et al., Case No. 5:17-cv-06532-EJD (which we refer to
as the “Geller Complaint”). On November 11, 2017, Kantradt LLC, a purported stockholder of Silver Spring, filed a putative

in the United States District Court in the Northern District of California against Silver Spring and the individual members of the
Silver Spring board of directors, captioned Kantradt LLC v. Silver Spring Networks, Inc., et al., No. 5:17-cv-06548-VC (which we
refer to as the “Kantradt Complaint” and together with the Geller Complaint, the “Complaints”). The Complaints each assert that
defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making untrue statements of material fact and omitting certain
material facts related to the contemplated merger in the proxy statement. The Complaints seek, among other things, an order
enjoining defendants from consummating the merger, money damages and an award of attorneys’ and experts’ fees. Silver Spring
believes that the lawsuits are without merit and, if the lawsuits are pursued, Silver Spring will vigorously defend itself.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

If the merger is consummated, Silver Spring stockholders who do not vote in favor of the merger proposal, who properly demand
appraisal of their shares, who continuously hold such shares through the effective time of the merger and who otherwise comply
with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL (including with respect to certain aggregate ownership requirements) will, subject
to the conditions thereof, be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL, which we
refer to as “Section 262.” Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a
“stockholder” are to a record holder of common stock.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its
entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. The following summary does not
constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that Silver Spring stockholders exercise their
appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the
shares registered in such holder’s name. A person or entity having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in
the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the
steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of our common stock
through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank,
broker or other nominee.

Under Section 262, holders of shares of common stock who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares
to Silver Spring prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement nor consent thereto in writing; (3) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time of the
merger; and (4) otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be the fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. However, after an appraisal petition has
been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Silver Spring stockholders who asserted
appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock as
measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 or (b) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares
exceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the “ownership thresholds.” Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its
discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the
effective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during such period. If at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters
judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the surviving corporation pays to each Silver Spring stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if
any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery and (2) any interest
accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to
make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.

Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less
than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available
and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Silver Spring’s notice to stockholders that
appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex C. In connection with the merger, any holder of shares of common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who
wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of
Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A Silver Spring stockholder
who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration described in the merger agreement.
Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of common stock, Silver
Spring believes that if a Silver Spring stockholder considers exercising such rights, such stockholder should seek the advice of legal
counsel.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Silver Spring stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the
following:

• the stockholder must not vote in favor of or consent to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;

• the stockholder must deliver to Silver Spring a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger proposal at the
special meeting;

• the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the
merger (a Silver Spring stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the effective
time of the merger); and

• a stockholder or the surviving company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination
of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective time of the merger. The surviving company is under no
obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.

In addition, one of the ownership thresholds describe above must be met.

Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the merger agreement, a Silver
Spring stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the merger
agreement, abstain or not vote its shares.

Filing Written Demand

Any holder of shares of Silver Spring common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Silver Spring, before the
vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares, and such
stockholder must not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of or consent to the adoption of the merger agreement. A holder of shares
of Silver Spring common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for
appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted
and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will
constitute a waiver of the Silver Spring stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for
appraisal. Therefore, a Silver Spring stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a
proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the
merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of
Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the
merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a demand. A Silver Spring
stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the
special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

Only a holder of record of shares of Silver Spring common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in
that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder
of record, and must reasonably inform Silver Spring of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand
appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a
trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of
record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all
joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal
on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in
executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.

SILVER SPRING STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES WITH A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE AND
WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER
NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR
OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF SUCH SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL
INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF

RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT
PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS
NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Silver Spring Networks, Inc.
230 W. Tasman Drive

San Jose, California 95134
Attention: General Counsel

Any holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered
pursuant to the merger agreement by delivering to Silver Spring a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any
such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require written approval of
the surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be
dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any Silver Spring stockholder who
has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for
appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective time of the merger.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation

If the merger is completed, within ten days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify each holder of
shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of or
consented to the adoption of the merger agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of shares of
common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal
proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a
petition filed by a Silver Spring stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all Silver Spring
stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition,
and holders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair
value of the shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of common stock who desire to have their shares appraised
should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of common stock within the time and in
the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of Silver Spring common stock to file such a petition within the period
specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.

Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with the
requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a
statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect
to which Silver Spring has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving
corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within ten days after receipt of the written request for such a
statement or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial
owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a
petition seeking appraisal or request from the surviving corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand
for appraisal can only be made by a Silver Spring stockholder of record.

If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving
corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in
Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all Silver Spring stockholders who have demanded payment for
their shares and with whom agreements as to the

value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of
Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those Silver Spring stockholders who have complied with
Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the Silver
Spring stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.

The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Silver Spring stockholders who assert appraisal rights
unless (a) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding
shares of common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 or (b) the value of the merger consideration
in respect of the shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions
as the “ownership thresholds.”

Determination of Fair Value

After determining the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, and that at least one of the ownership thresholds above has
been satisfied in respect of the Silver Spring stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in
accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such
proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the “fair value” of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors.
Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through
the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s
entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each Silver Spring stockholder seeking appraisal. If the
surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only
on the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and
the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (ii) interest accrued before such voluntary cash
payment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be
considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are
generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air
price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court
stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings
prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light
on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court
stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only
to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of
Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof
as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”

Silver Spring stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the
merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a
financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair
value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Silver Spring believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation
is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and Silver Spring
stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the
same as, the merger consideration. Neither Silver Spring nor Itron anticipate

TABLE OF CONTENTS

offering more than the merger consideration to any Silver Spring stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Silver Spring
and Itron reserves the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any
appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of common stock is less than the per share merger
consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in
respect of the Silver Spring stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal
proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application
of a Silver Spring stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any
Silver Spring stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and
expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.

If any Silver Spring stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Silver Spring common stock under Section 262
fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of common stock will
be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the merger consideration. A Silver
Spring stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, such holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is
filed within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect
of the Silver Spring stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written
withdrawal of the holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger consideration in accordance with Section 262.

From and after the effective time of the merger, no Silver Spring stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to
vote such shares of common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except
dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of common stock, if any, payable to Silver Spring stockholders as of a time
prior to the effective time of the merger. If no petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of
the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the Silver Spring stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the
stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the
merger, either within 60 days after the effective time of the merger or thereafter with the written approval of the surviving
corporation, then the right of such Silver Spring stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the
Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any Silver Spring stockholder who
commenced the proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval of the court.

Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a Silver Spring stockholder’s
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any Silver Spring stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult
legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following summary describes certain material provisions of the merger agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the merger agreement included as Annex A to this proxy statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not
contain all of the information about the merger agreement that may be important to you. We encourage you to read the merger
agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the legal document governing the merger. In this section of the proxy statement
entitled “Terms of the Merger Agreement,” from time to time, we may refer to Silver Spring, Itron and Merger Sub collectively as
the parties or individually as a party.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

The merger agreement has been included as Annex A to this proxy statement for your convenience to provide you with information
regarding its terms, and we recommend that you read it carefully and in its entirety. The merger agreement is a legal instrument that
is intended to govern the contractual rights and relationships, and to allocate risks, among Silver Spring, Itron and Merger Sub.

Following the consummation of the merger, each Silver Spring stockholder will be entitled to enforce the applicable provisions of
the merger agreement to the extent necessary to receive the merger consideration to which such Silver Spring stockholder is entitled
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable provisions of the merger agreement. In the event of a termination of
the merger agreement, a party to the merger agreement may seek damages in the case of a “willful breach” of the merger agreement
by the other party or parties.

The merger agreement contains representations and warranties made by Itron and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Silver Spring,
on the other hand, that are qualified in several important respects, which you should consider as you read them in the merger
agreement. The representations and warranties are qualified in their entirety by certain information of Silver Spring filed with the
SEC by Silver Spring before the date of the merger agreement. In addition, the representations, warranties and covenants of the
parties are qualified by confidential disclosures that Silver Spring delivered to Itron in connection with the execution of the merger
agreement.

Certain of the representations and warranties made by Itron and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Silver Spring, on the other hand,
were made as of a specified date, and may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties to the merger
agreement rather than as establishing matters as facts. Information concerning the subject matter of the representations and
warranties may have changed since the date of the merger agreement. Moreover, certain of the representations, warranties and
covenants of the parties may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to
stockholders.

None of the representations or warranties will survive the closing of the merger and they will therefore have no legal effect under
the merger agreement after the closing of the merger. The obligations of Itron and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are subject
to the continued accuracy of certain of Silver Spring’s representations and warranties, with an enumerated dollar threshold applied
to the inaccuracies of representations and warranties related to Silver Spring’s capitalization, and materiality or material adverse
effect threshold applied to the inaccuracies of all other representations and warranties of Silver Spring (as described in the section
entitled “—Conditions to Consummation of the Merger” beginning on page 97 of this proxy statement). The obligation of Silver
Spring to consummate the merger is subject to the continued accuracy of the representations and warranties made by Itron and
Merger Sub, except for any such inaccuracies that would not prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement or the ability of Itron and Merger Sub to fully perform their obligations under the merger agreement. Except as
described below in the section entitled “—Third-Party Beneficiaries” beginning on page 102 of this proxy statement, Silver Spring
stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not unduly rely on the representations,
warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Silver Spring,
Itron or Merger Sub, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.

The representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement and the description thereof in this proxy statement should
not be read alone but instead should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in the documents that Silver Spring
publicly files with the SEC. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the public filings that Silver
Spring makes with the SEC, as described in the section entitled “Where Stockholders Can Find More Information” beginning on
page 111 of this proxy statement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Terms of the Merger; Merger Consideration

The merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, and in
accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Silver Spring. As a result
of the merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and Silver Spring will continue as the surviving corporation of the
merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Itron. As a result of the merger, Silver Spring, as the surviving corporation, will succeed
to all of the rights and obligations of Merger Sub and Silver Spring.

At the effective time of the merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement:

• each share of Silver Spring common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
other than (i) excluded shares and (ii) dissenting shares, will be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to
receive the merger consideration of $16.25 in cash, without interest (less any applicable withholding or other taxes, or
other amounts required to be withheld);

• each excluded share will be automatically cancelled and extinguished without any conversion, and no payment or
distribution will be made with respect to such excluded shares;

• each dissenting share will be treated as described in the section entitled “—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 70 of this
proxy statement; and

• each share of common stock of Merger Sub, $0.001 par value per share, that is issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger, will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the surviving corporation, $0.001 par value per share.

If between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger the outstanding shares of Silver Spring common
stock are changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, consolidation or exchange of shares, or any similar event (excluding the
granting or other issuance of Silver Spring options, RSUs or PSUs in the ordinary course of business), then the merger consideration
and the exchange ratio applicable to assumed options, assumed RSUs and assumed PSUs will be appropriately adjusted to provide
the holders of Silver Spring common stock and holders of assumed options, assumed RSUs and assumed PSUs the same economic
effect as contemplated by the merger agreement prior to any such event.

Closing of the Merger

The closing of the merger will take place no later than the fifth business day after the last to be satisfied of the closing conditions set
forth in the merger agreement unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by Silver Spring, Itron and Merger Sub, provided
that if the marketing period for the financing has not ended at the time of the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in the
merger agreement, the closing of the merger will not occur until the earlier of (i) a date during the marketing period specified by
Itron with three business days’ notice to Silver Spring (and subject to simultaneous closing of the financing) or (ii) the second
business day following the final day of the marketing period, or if the final day of the marketing period is within two business days
prior to the termination date (as defined in the section entitled “—Termination; Effect of Termination”), then the termination date.
For a description of the conditions to closing under the merger agreement, see the section entitled “—Conditions to Consummation
of the Merger” beginning on page 97 of this proxy statement. Subject to certain limited blackout periods in November, December
and January, the marketing period is the first period of 15 consecutive business days throughout which Silver Spring has provided
certain required financial and other information about Silver Spring and during which, among other things, Silver Spring’s
independent auditors have not withdrawn or qualified their audit opinion with respect to Silver Spring’s audited financial statements,
and such financial and other information is in material compliance with all requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act
(to the extent applicable).

Effective Time of the Merger

The effective time of the merger will be at the time a certificate of merger is duly filed with and accepted by the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or such other date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the certificate of merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation

At the effective time of the merger, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of Silver Spring and the amended and
restated bylaws of Silver Spring, in each case, as in effect prior to the effective time of the merger, will be amended in their entirety
to conform to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger (except that the name of the surviving corporation will be “Silver Spring Networks, Inc.”), subject to Itron’s and
the surviving corporation’s obligations described in the section entitled “—Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance”
beginning on page 96 of this proxy statement. In addition, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will be the initial directors of the surviving corporation and, other than as specified by Itron prior to the effective time of the
merger, the officers of Silver Spring immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the initial officers of the surviving
corporation, in each case, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

Treatment of Equity Awards

Cancellation and Cash-Out of Certain Equity Awards

At the effective time of the merger:

• each vested option to purchase shares of Silver Spring common stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger and that has a per share exercise price that is less than the merger consideration will be
cancelled at the effective time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, less applicable withholding taxes,
equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to such option and (ii)
the excess of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price under such option;

• each option to purchase shares of Silver Spring common stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger, whether vested or unvested, that has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the
merger consideration will become vested and exercisable by the holder thereof, and each such option that remains
unexercised and outstanding at the effective time will be cancelled with no payment made therefor;

• each option to purchase shares of Silver Spring common stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger held by a non-employee member of the Silver Spring board of directors that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and that has a per share exercise price that is less than the merger
consideration will be cancelled in exchange for an amount in cash, less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product
of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to such option and (ii) the excess of the
merger consideration over the per share exercise price under such option;

• each RSU that remains outstanding and is fully vested as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
cancelled at the effective time and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, less applicable
withholding taxes, equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to
such RSU and (ii) the merger consideration;

• each RSU held by a non-employee member of the Silver Spring board of directors that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled at the effective time and converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (i) the aggregate
number of shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to such RSU and (ii) the merger consideration;

• each PSU that was granted during 2015 and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger and will terminate without the payment of any consideration therefor
and the holders of such PSUs granted during 2015 will cease to have any rights with respect thereto; and

• for each PSU that was granted in 2017 and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
the performance conditions will be deemed satisfied at 100% of the target level of achievement and (i) the portion of each
such PSU that is outstanding and unvested as to service-based vesting conditions will be treated as an assumed RSU and
assumed by Itron as described below, and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(ii) the portion of each such PSU that is outstanding and vested as to both performance conditions and service-based
conditions will be treated as an RSU (as described above that is, cancelled and automatically converted into the right to
receive an amount of cash (less any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of
shares of Silver Spring common stock subject to such PSU and (ii) the merger consideration).

Assumption of Certain Equity Awards

Each assumed option will be assumed by Itron at the effective time of the merger and converted into and become an adjusted option
on the same material terms and conditions (including vesting) as were applicable under the corresponding assumed option
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, as follows: (i) the number of shares of Itron common stock subject to each
adjusted options will be the number of shares of Silver Spring common stock that were subject to the corresponding assumed option
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by the exchange ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares Itron common stock; and (ii) the per share exercise price for the Itron common stock issuable upon exercise of each
adjusted option will be the applicable per share exercise price of the corresponding assumed option, as in effect immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger, divided by the exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

Each assumed RSU will be automatically assumed by Itron at the effective time of the merger and converted into a restricted stock
unit to receive, on substantially the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as were applicable under such assumed RSU
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, a number of shares of Itron common stock equal to the number of shares of
Silver Spring common stock that were subject to such assumed RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
multiplied by the exchange ratio and rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Itron common stock.

Treatment of 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

With respect to Silver Spring’s 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer to as the “ESPP,” and each purchase right
granted thereunder:

• participation in the plan will be limited to those individuals who were participants in the plan as of September 17, 2017;

• the participants may not (i) increase their payroll contribution rate from the rate in effect as of September 17, 2017 or (ii)
make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP that has the effect of increasing his or her contribution rate in effect
as of September 17, 2017;

• the purchase period in effect as of September 17, 2017 will terminate no later than three business days before the closing
date of the merger;

• each purchase right outstanding as of the effective date of termination of the purchase period will be automatically
exercised by applying the payroll deductions of each participant for such purchase period to the purchase of a number of
whole shares of Silver Spring common stock (subject to the provisions of the ESPP regarding the number of shares of
Silver Spring common stock purchasable) in accordance with the terms of the ESPP; and

• Silver Spring will terminate the ESPP immediately prior to and effective as of the effective time of the merger.

Payment of Merger Consideration; Exchange of Shares in the Merger

Prior to the effective time of the merger, Itron will appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Silver Spring as a
paying agent and enter into a paying agent agreement with such paying agent for the payment of the merger consideration. At or
promptly following the closing of the merger, Itron will deposit (or cause to be deposited), with the paying agent, for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Silver Spring common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
(other than excluded shares or dissenting shares), cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration payable to
holders of such shares of Silver Spring common stock. The payment fund will not be used for any other purpose but may be
invested by the paying agent in certain investments, as directed by Itron or the surviving corporation. Any

TABLE OF CONTENTS

interest or other income resulting from such investments will be payable to Itron. To the extent that there are any losses with respect
to any such investments, or the payment fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the paying agent to promptly
pay amounts contemplated under the merger agreement, Itron will, or will cause the surviving corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the payment fund to ensure the payment fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the paying agent to
make the required payments to the Silver Spring stockholders.

Promptly after the effective time of the merger, Itron and the surviving corporation will cause the paying agent to mail to each
record holder of shares of Silver Spring common stock (other than holders of excluded shares or dissenting shares) (i) a customary
letter of transmittal specifying that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to any certificates evidencing ownership of
Silver Spring common stock will pass, only upon delivery of such certificates to the paying agent, and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Silver Spring common stock certificates or uncertificated shares of Silver Spring common stock
represented by book-entry in exchange for the merger consideration.

Upon surrender of share certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates) and a duly completed and validly
executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent for cancellation, or transfer of non-certificated shares represented by book-entry
(along with such other documents as the paying agent may customarily require), the holder of such shares of Silver Spring common
stock will be entitled to receive the merger consideration in exchange for such shares, and the surrendered certificates will be
canceled.

Under the merger agreement, each of the paying agent, the surviving corporation and Itron are entitled to deduct and withhold such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld under all applicable federal, state or local tax laws from the merger
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Silver Spring common stock, stock options, RSUs, PSUs and purchase rights under
the ESPP and to pay such amounts deducted or withheld to the appropriate governmental authority. To the extent such amounts are
properly withheld by the paying agent, the surviving corporation or Itron, as the case may be, such withheld amounts will be treated
for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

Silver Spring Stockholders Should Not Return Stock Certificates with the Enclosed Proxy Card, and Silver Spring
Stockholders Should Not Forward Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent without a Letter of Transmittal.

In the event that a transfer of ownership of shares of Silver Spring common stock is not registered in the stock transfer records of
Silver Spring, or if the merger consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in which the certificates or uncertificated shares
are registered in the stock transfer records of Silver Spring, payment of the merger consideration may be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the surrendered share certificate is registered only if such certificate or uncertificated share is properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the person requesting such payment has paid to Itron (or any
agent designated by Itron) any applicable transfer or other taxes required or established to the satisfaction of Itron that all such
applicable transfer or other taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

Until surrendered, all outstanding share certificates and uncertificated shares will be deemed from and after the effective time of the
merger as representing only the right to receive, upon surrender, the merger consideration, without interest thereon, to which the
holder of such share certificate is entitled.

Holders of uncertificated shares of Silver Spring common stock represented by book-entry are not required to deliver a share
certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent to receive the merger consideration. Rather, each registered holder
of one or more shares of Silver Spring common stock represented by book-entry is entitled to receive the merger consideration for
each share held in book-entry at the effective time of the merger upon receipt of an agent’s message by the paying agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the paying agent may reasonably request).

Pursuant to the merger agreement, any portion of the funds held by the paying agent that remains undistributed to former Silver
Spring stockholders on the date that is nine months after the effective time of the merger will be delivered to Itron upon demand.
Thereafter, any former Silver Spring stockholders who have not previously surrendered their share certificates or uncertificated
shares may look only to Itron, as general unsecured creditors thereof, for payment of the merger consideration to which such holders
may be entitled.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates

If any Silver Spring common stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if required by Itron or the paying agent, the delivery of
a bond in such customary and reasonable amount as Itron or the paying agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Itron, the surviving corporation or the paying agent with respect to the share certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the paying agent will pay the merger consideration to which the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate is entitled pursuant to the merger agreement.

Closing of the Share Transfer Books

From and after the effective time of the merger, (i) all shares of Silver Spring common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and all former Silver Spring stockholders will
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except for the right to receive the merger consideration and those rights
described in the section entitled “—Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 70 of this proxy statement and (ii) there will be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Silver Spring common stock thereafter on the records of the surviving corporation other than
transfers to reflect trades effected prior to the effective time of the merger. After the effective time of the merger, any Silver Spring
common stock certificates or uncertificated shares of Silver Spring common stock represented in book-entry that are presented to
the surviving corporation for any reason will be canceled against delivery of the merger consideration to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to the merger agreement.

Appraisal Rights

Shares of Silver Spring common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and held by a
holder of record who did not vote in favor of the merger proposal (or consent thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand, and has
properly demanded, that Silver Spring purchase such shares (which we refer to as “dissenting shares”) for fair market value in
accordance with, and in compliance in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL, will not be converted into the right to receive the
merger consideration, but instead, at the effective time of the merger, will be automatically cancelled and cease to exist, and each
holder of record of a dissenting share will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive payment of the
fair market value of such dissenting shares as may be determined to be due pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to payment of the fair market value of such dissenting shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to receive such payment in respect of such dissenting shares will
cease and such dissenting shares will be deemed to have been converted, as of the effective time of the merger, into and will be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest or duplication. Silver Spring will provide
Itron prompt notice of any demands received by Silver Spring for the appraisal of shares of Silver Spring common stock pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
Silver Spring relating to demands for appraisal of dissenting shares, and Itron will have the opportunity to consult with Silver Spring
and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal. Silver Spring will not, without the
prior written consent of Itron (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment, in respect of dissenting shares.

Representations and Warranties

The merger agreement contains certain representations and warranties made by Silver Spring to Itron and Merger Sub and certain
representations and warranties made by Itron and Merger Sub to Silver Spring. These representations and warranties are subject to
important limitations and qualifications agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement.
In particular, certain of the representations and warranties that Silver Spring made in the merger agreement are qualified by certain
confidential disclosures that Silver Spring delivered to Itron in connection with the execution of the merger agreement. In addition,
certain representations and warranties were made as of a specified date, may be subject to contractual standards of materiality
different from those generally applicable to public disclosures to stockholders, may be subject in some cases to other exceptions and
qualifications (including that an inaccuracy in a representation or warranty

would not reasonably be expected to have a “material adverse effect” (as described in the section entitled “—Material Adverse
Effect Definition” beginning on page 82 of this proxy statement)), or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk among
the parties rather than establishing matters of fact. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement for
purposes of the representations and warranties, and in reviewing the representations and warranties contained in the merger
agreement or any descriptions thereof in this proxy statement, it is important to bear in mind that such representations and
warranties or any description thereof may not have been intended by the parties to the merger agreement to be characterizations of
the actual state of facts or condition of Silver Spring, Itron or Merger Sub, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The
representations and warranties given by the parties in the merger agreement or any description thereof should not be read alone and
should instead be read in conjunction with the other information contained in the information that Silver Spring and Itron publicly
file with the SEC. None of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement survive the consummation of the merger.

agreement and the consummation by Silver Spring of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

respect thereto; and

• the absence of any undisclosed brokers’, finder’s, financial advisors’ or other similar fees related to the merger.

Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by a “materiality” or “material adverse effect”
standard (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless a materiality threshold is satisfied or their failure to be true
or correct would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect).

Material Adverse Effect Definition

For purposes of the merger agreement, a “material adverse effect” means, with respect to Silver Spring, any change, effect, event,
condition, state of facts, or development, individually or in the aggregate, and taken together with all other changes, effects, events,
conditions, state of facts, or developments, (i) that prevents, or would reasonably be expected to prevent, consummation of the
merger by Silver Spring or performance by Silver

changes or failures, unless such changes or failures would otherwise be separately excepted from the definition of
“material adverse effect”).

However, if any change described in the first six bullets immediately above, has a disproportionate impact on Silver Spring and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in comparison to other companies that operate in the industries in which Silver Spring and its
subsidiaries operate, such disproportionate impact will be taken into account when determining whether a “material adverse effect”
has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur.

Any change described in the seventh and eighth bullets above will not apply with respect to any representation or warranty that by

No Solicitation by Silver Spring of Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Board Recommendation

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Silver Spring has agreed to immediately cease (and to cause its subsidiaries to immediately
cease) any and all existing discussions, negotiations and solicitations with any person or entity prior to September 17, 2017 with
respect to any “acquisition proposal” (as defined below in this section), to revoke “data room” access to such persons or entities and
to request the prompt return or destruction of all non-public Silver Spring information furnished to any such person in connection
therewith.

From the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the effective time of the merger and the termination of the merger
agreement in accordance with its terms, subject to certain exceptions described below in this section, Silver Spring has agreed that it
will not (and will cause its subsidiaries not to and will instruct and cause Silver Spring's officers, directors, employees, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants, and other advisors (which we collectively refer to as “Silver Spring representatives”) not to),
directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate, seek, knowingly encourage, knowingly facilitate or knowingly induce the making, submission or
announcement of any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

• enter into, participate in, maintain or continue any communications (except solely to notify such person of the restrictions
of the non-solicitation provision contained in the merger agreement) or negotiations regarding, or deliver, furnish or make
available to any person or entity any non-public information or afford any person or entity access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or the personnel, of Silver Spring or any of its
subsidiaries with respect to, or take any other action regarding, any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal;

• agree to, accept, approve, adopt, endorse or recommend (or propose or announce any intention or desire to do any of the
foregoing) any acquisition proposal, or propose or announce any intention to do any of the foregoing with respect to any
acquisition proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

• enter into any letter of intent, term sheet, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding or similar document or
agreement or any other contract contemplating or otherwise relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any acquisition proposal or enter into any agreement requiring Silver Spring to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; or

• submit any acquisition proposal to the vote of the Silver Spring stockholders.

Prior to the effective time of the merger, neither Silver Spring nor any of its subsidiaries may terminate, amend, modify or waive
any rights under, or release any person or entity (other than Itron or Merger Sub) from, any “standstill” or other similar agreement
between Silver Spring or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such person or entity, on the other, unless the Silver Spring
board of directors and/or any authorized committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Silver Spring stockholders under
Delaware law.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Additionally, prior to the date that Silver Spring stockholders approve the merger proposal, if Silver Spring receives a bona fide,
written and unsolicited acquisition proposal from any person or entity, Silver Spring or its board of directors may, directly or
indirectly through Silver Spring representatives, participate in discussions or negotiations with such person or entity that made the
bona fide, written and unsolicited acquisition proposal and/or furnish to such person or entity any non-public information relating to
Silver Spring and its subsidiaries (provided that Silver Spring contemporaneously provides such non-public information to Itron to
the extent such information has not previously been furnished to Itron) and/or afford access to the business, properties, assets,
books, records or other non-public information, or the personnel of Silver Spring or any of its subsidiaries, in each case pursuant to
an “acceptable confidentiality agreement,” provided that Silver Spring did not receive such acquisition proposal as a result of a
breach of the non-solicitation provision contained in the merger agreement and, prior to taking such action:

• the Silver Spring board of directors determines in good faith: (i) after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal is, or is reasonably expected to lead to a “superior proposal” (as defined
below in this section), and (ii) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that its failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Silver Spring stockholders under Delaware law; and

• Silver Spring provides to Itron: (i) written notice of the identity of such person or entity making such acquisition proposal
and of Silver Spring’s intention to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non-public
information to, such person or entity, and (ii) a copy of such acquisition proposal (unless such acquisition proposal is not
made in writing, in which case Silver Spring will provide the material terms of such acquisition proposal).

For the purposes of the merger agreement and as used in this proxy statement, a confidentiality agreement is an “acceptable
confidentiality agreement” if it is effective as of, or after September 17, 2017, and contains provisions that require any counter-party
thereto (and any of their representatives named therein) that receives material non-public information of or with respect to Silver
Spring to keep such information confidential and use such information only in connection with the evaluation of a negotiated
transaction and that has terms that are no less restrictive in the aggregate to such counterparty(ies) (and any of their representatives
named therein) than the terms contained in the confidentiality agreement between Silver Spring and Itron, provided that such an
acceptable confidentiality agreement need not include a standstill restriction or other similar provisions.

Silver Spring must promptly, and in any event within the earlier of one business day or 36 hours, (i) provide written notice to Itron
of, and discuss with Itron to the extent requested by Itron, the receipt of (A) any acquisition proposal, (B) any requests for
information that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal or (C) any inquiries received by Silver Spring with
respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal and (ii) disclose to Itron the material terms and
conditions of any such acquisition proposal, request or inquiry (including copies of any written materials provided to Silver Spring
in connection with or related to such acquisition proposal, request or inquiry) and the identity of the third party making such
acquisition proposal, request or inquiry. Silver Spring will (i) keep Itron reasonably informed on a current basis (and in any event
within the earlier of one business day or 36 hours after) any material change in the status of discussions regarding the material terms
(including all amendments) of any such acquisition proposal, request or inquiry and (ii) promptly (and in any event within the
earlier of one business day or 36 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof, provide Itron (or its outside counsel) with copies of all
material documents exchanged between Silver Spring and the third party making the acquisition proposal. Silver Spring will provide
Itron at least 24 hours’ prior notice (or such shorter notice that is provided to the Silver Spring board of directors) of any meeting of
the Silver Spring board of directors at which it is reasonably expected to consider an acquisition proposal.

If any subsidiary of Silver Spring or Silver Spring representative takes any action that, if taken by Silver Spring, would constitute a
breach of the non-solicitation provision contained in the merger agreement, then Silver Spring will be deemed to have breached the
non-solicitation provision contained in the merger agreement.

Subject to the exceptions described below in this section, the Silver Spring board of directors unanimously recommended that Silver
Spring stockholders vote in favor of the merger proposal, and Silver Spring has agreed that none of it, its board of directors or any
committee thereof will, or will, (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Itron, or publicly propose
to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or

modify in a manner adverse to Itron, the recommendation that Silver Spring stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve
the merger, (ii) approve, endorse or recommend any acquisition proposal, or (iii) fail to recommend against the acceptance of any
tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Silver Spring common stock within ten business days after the commencement of such
offer. The actions described in any of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) are referred to as a “company board recommendation
change.”

Prior to the receipt of the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of Silver Spring common
stock to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger, the Silver Spring board of directors and/or any authorized committee
thereof may effect a company board recommendation change if and only if (i) Silver Spring receives an unsolicited, bona fide
written acquisition proposal (not received as a result of a breach of the non-solicitation provisions contained in the merger
agreement) that its board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) is a superior proposal and determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
that its failure to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such superior proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to Silver Spring stockholders under Delaware law or (ii) an “intervening event” (as defined below in this section) occurs and as a
result thereof the Silver Spring board of directors and/or any authorized committee thereof determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action in light of such intervening event would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to Silver Spring stockholders under Delaware law; provided, that:

• prior to making a company board recommendation change with respect to a superior proposal:

• Silver Spring has notified Itron in writing of the superior proposal and that it intends to effect a company board
recommendation change;

• Silver Spring has provided Itron with the identity of the person or entity making such superior proposal and a copy of
all proposed definitive agreements (including financing agreements, if any) with respect to such superior proposal,
with any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such superior proposal requiring Silver Spring
to provide an additional notice to Itron;

• if requested by Itron, for a period of four business days after delivery of such notice, Silver Spring has discussed and
negotiated, and caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, in good faith (and Silver Spring has made Silver
Spring representatives available to discuss) with Itron and its representatives (to the extent Itron desires to negotiate),
any proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that such superior proposal ceases
to constitute a superior proposal; and

• the Silver Spring board of directors and/or any authorized committee thereof has determined in good faith, after
considering the terms of any written offer to modify the terms of the merger agreement made by Itron prior to the
expiration of the four business day period described in the immediately preceding bullet point that would, upon
acceptance by Silver Spring, be binding on Itron, that such superior proposal still constitutes a superior proposal, and
that the failure to make a company board recommendation change in connection therewith would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to Silver Spring stockholders under Delaware law. The parties have agreed that any change to the
financial or other material terms of a proposal that is the subject of written notice described in the third preceding
bullet point above will require Silver Spring to provide a new notice to Itron and to again comply with the
requirements in this bullet point and the two immediately preceding bullet points, except that the four business day
notice period described in the immediately preceding bullet point will be shortened to two business days following
such new notice.

• prior to making a company board recommendation change with respect to an intervening event:

• Silver Spring has notified Itron in writing of such intervening event, including a reasonable description of the
intervening event, and that it intends to make a company board recommendation change;

• if requested by Itron, for a period of four business days after delivery of such notice, Silver Spring has discussed and
negotiated, and caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, in good faith

(and Silver Spring has made Silver Spring representatives available to discuss) with Itron and its representatives (to
the extent Itron desires to negotiate), any proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement
so that the failure to make a company board recommendation change in connection therewith would no longer be a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Silver Spring board of directors; and

• the Silver Spring board of directors has determined in good faith, after considering the terms of any written offer to
modify the terms of the merger agreement made by Itron within the four business day period described in the
immediately preceding bullet point, that would, upon acceptance by Silver Spring thereof, be binding on Itron, that
the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Silver Spring stockholders under
Delaware law.

For the purposes of the merger agreement, the term “acquisition proposal” means any inquiry, offer, proposal or indication of
interest from any person or group (other than Itron or Merger Sub) to engage in, or that otherwise could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any transaction or series of related transactions involving: (i) any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition, after
September 17, 2017, by any person, entity or “group” (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), whether from
Silver Spring and/or any other person or entity, of shares of Silver Spring common stock representing 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock or securities of Silver Spring representing 15% or more of the voting power of
Silver Spring, in each case after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other acquisition, including pursuant to a
tender offer or exchange offer by any person or “group” (as defined in or under Section 13(d) the Exchange Act) that, if
consummated, would result in such person or “group” beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Silver Spring
common stock or securities of Silver Spring representing 15% or more of the voting power of Silver Spring, in each case after
giving effect to the consummation of such tender or exchange offer, (ii) any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any
person, entity or “group” (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 15% or more of the consolidated assets or
businesses of Silver Spring and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value thereof as of the date of such
sale, transfer, acquisition or disposition), (iii) any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination, share exchange,
joint venture or other similar transaction involving Silver Spring pursuant to which any person or “group” (as defined in or under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than the Silver Spring stockholders (as a group) immediately prior to the consummation
of such transaction (provided that no person or entity will be so excluded if they are acquiring Silver Spring common stock in such a
transaction acting as part of a “group” (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), would hold shares of Silver
Spring common stock representing 15% or more of the shares of Silver Spring common stock outstanding after giving effect to the
consummation of such transaction or 15% or more of the consolidated assets or businesses of Silver Spring and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value thereof), (iv) a liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of Silver Spring, or
(v) any combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated
revenues, earnings and shares of Silver Spring common stock (or voting power of securities of Silver Spring) involved is greater
than or equal to 15%.

For the purposes of the merger agreement, the term “intervening event” means any material event or change in circumstance
occurring or arising after September 17, 2017 that (i) was not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Silver Spring board of
directors on such date (or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known by the Silver Spring board of
directors as of such date), which event or change in circumstance becomes known to the Silver Spring board of directors prior to the
adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger by the Silver Spring stockholders and (ii) does not relate to (A) any
acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction, (B) any events, changes or circumstances relating to Itron or any of its affiliates, (C)
clearance of the merger under any antitrust laws, (D) the fact, in and of itself, that Silver Spring meets or exceeds any internal or
public expectations, estimates or projections of Silver Spring’s revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of
operations for any period, in and of itself (however, any underlying cause thereof that is not separately excluded from the definition
of “intervening event” may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an intervening event has occurred), (E) any
change in the price or trading volume of Silver Spring common stock (however, any underlying cause thereof that is not separately
excluded from the definition of “intervening event” may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an intervening
event has occurred) or (F) any events, changes or circumstances relating to the launch of any product that is in development by
Silver Spring or any of its subsidiaries as of September 17, 2017.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For the purposes of the merger agreement, the term “superior proposal” means any unsolicited bona fide written acquisition
proposal made by a third party for an acquisition transaction that (i) did not arise out of or result from a breach of the non-
solicitation provisions of the merger agreement and (ii) is on terms that the Silver Spring board of directors have determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel), taking into account all relevant legal, financial, tax,
regulatory and other aspects of such acquisition proposal (including the identity of the third party making such acquisition
transaction) and the timing and likelihood of consummation of such acquisition transaction, is more favorable from a financial point
of view to the Silver Spring stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the merger, after also taking into account any changes to
the terms of the merger agreement offered by Itron in response to such acquisition proposal; provided that for purposes of the
reference to an “acquisition proposal” in this definition of “superior proposal,” all references to “15%” in the definition of
“acquisition proposal” above will be deemed to be references to “50%.”

Nothing contained in the merger agreement prevents the Silver Spring board of directors and/or any authorized committee thereof
from taking and disclosing to the Silver Spring stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or
complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act (including making any “stop, look and listen”
communication to the Silver Spring stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its
position thereunder); provided that a company board recommendation change may only be made in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the merger agreement described above in this section.

Obligations with Respect to the Special Meeting

Under the merger agreement, Silver Spring has agreed that, acting through the Silver Spring board of directors, it will establish a
record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Silver Spring stockholders, for the purpose of
obtaining the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock in favor of the
merger proposal in accordance with the DGCL. If there are holders of insufficient shares of Silver Spring common stock present or
represented by proxy at the special meeting to constitute a quorum, Silver Spring retains the right to and will make one or more
successive adjournments or postponements of the meeting to a date within five business days after the date for which such meeting
was originally scheduled. If Silver Spring has not received enough proxies to represent a number of shares of Silver Spring common
stock to secure the affirmative vote of its stockholders in favor of the merger proposal, Silver Spring retains the right to and will
make one adjournment or postponement of the special meeting to a date within a period that is not more than ten business days after
the date for which such meeting was originally scheduled. Silver Spring has further agreed that, unless there has been a company
board recommendation change, it will use its reasonable efforts to secure the affirmative vote of its stockholders in favor of the
merger proposal.

Consents, Approvals and Filings

Each of Silver Spring, on the one hand, and Itron and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will (and will cause their respective
subsidiaries to) use their reasonable best efforts to, subject to compliance with applicable laws, take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties in doing, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws or otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner possible, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including using reasonable best
efforts to:

• cause the conditions to each party’s obligation to consummate the merger contemplated by the merger agreement to be
satisfied;

• obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from governmental
authorities and make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with governmental authorities that are necessary
to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and

• obtain all necessary or appropriate consents, waivers and approvals under any material contracts or material permits of
Silver Spring or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under such material contracts and
material permits following the consummation of

the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; provided that Silver Spring will coordinate with Itron and
reasonably cooperate to determine whether to seek any consents, waivers or approvals from third parties under any
material contract; provided, further, that neither Itron, Silver Spring nor any of their respective subsidiaries will be
required to (nor will Silver Spring or any of its subsidiaries agree to do so without Itron’s prior consent) pay any consent
or similar fee (other than administrative fees or costs) to obtain the consent, waiver or approval of any third party with
respect to any contracts of Silver Spring or its subsidiaries.

Each of Itron and Silver Spring will, to the extent permitted by applicable law and not prohibited by the applicable governmental
authority (and subject to all applicable privileges, including the attorney-client privilege):

• cooperate and coordinate with the other party in making such parties’ initial HSR filings and in resolving any investigation
or other inquiry of any governmental authorities under applicable laws (including antitrust laws);

• supply the other party with any information that may be required to make such filings;

• supply any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the DOJ, the FTC and the
governmental authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing is made under any other applicable
laws; and

• use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, or offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to take), all
actions and use reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust law as soon as practicable, obtain any required consents under any
other antitrust laws applicable to the merger as soon as reasonably practicable, and to avoid any impediment to the
consummation of the merger under any applicable laws (including antitrust laws) or orders, so as to enable the
consummation of the merger to occur as promptly as practicable following September 17, 2017, including using
reasonable best efforts to take all such action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the
FTC, the DOJ, or any other governmental authority may assert under any applicable laws (including antitrust laws) or
orders or any other person may assert under antitrust laws, in each case with respect to the merger.

Notwithstanding anything in the merger agreement to the contrary, none of Itron, Merger Sub or Silver Spring will be required to
agree to any term or take any action in connection with the foregoing that is not conditioned upon consummation of the merger, and
neither Itron nor Merger Sub will be required to (and none of Silver Spring or any of its subsidiaries will, without Itron’s prior
consent) propose, negotiate, or agree to any (i) sale, divestiture or exclusive license of assets, product lines, operations, or
businesses of Itron, Silver Spring, or any of their respective subsidiaries, or to any hold separate order or to take any action
(including a consent decree) in furtherance of any of the foregoing, (ii) non-exclusive license (other than an acceptable non-
exclusive license (as defined below in this section)) or (iii) other operational restrictions or conduct-based remedy that would, after
the effective time of the merger, limit Itron’s or any of its affiliates’ freedom of action with respect to any of the assets, product
lines, operations, or businesses of any of Itron or Silver Spring or any of their respective subsidiaries, in each case, if it would be
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, financial condition, assets, or results of operations of
Silver Spring and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of Itron (any remedy that is contemplated by clause (i), (ii) or (iii) (excluding
agreeing to an acceptable non-exclusive license), we refer to as a “burdensome condition”); provided, further, that Silver Spring, if
requested by Itron, will agree to and effect any action, as specified by Itron and on terms and conditions specified by Itron, so long
as such agreement is binding upon Silver Spring only following the effective time of the merger.

For the purposes of the merger agreement, an “acceptable non-exclusive license” means providing a non-exclusive license (i) for
third party products or services to access and interoperate with Itron’s, Silver Spring’s, or their respective subsidiaries’ networks or
related access points on terms and in a manner no less favorable than available with respect to their own similar products or services
or (ii) of the assets, product lines,

operations, or businesses of any of Itron or Silver Spring or any of their respective subsidiaries, in each case with respect to the
license described in this clause (ii) only, that individually or in the aggregate, generated total collected revenues equal to or less than
$30 million in Itron’s or Silver Spring’s fiscal year 2016, as applicable.

Financing and Financing Cooperation

Itron and Merger Sub are required under the merger agreement to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the financing
on the terms, and subject only to the conditions described in, the amended commitment letter and any related fee letter. In the event
that any portion of the financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the amended commitment letter,
Itron is required to use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing for the amount of financing that is sufficient to fund the
required amount. As of the last practicable date before the printing of this proxy statement, the amended commitment letter remains
in effect, and Itron has not notified Silver Spring of any plans to utilize financing in lieu of the financing described above. The
definitive documentation governing the financing contemplated by the amended commitment letter has not been finalized and,
accordingly, the actual terms of the financing may differ from those described in this proxy statement.

The commitments under the amended commitment letter will terminate at the earliest to occur of (i) the consummation of the
merger, (ii) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms and (iii) the end date.

Silver Spring is required to use reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause its subsidiaries to provide, all cooperation reasonably
requested by Itron necessary and customary for the arrangement of the financing, subject to certain limitations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Silver Spring nor any of its subsidiaries is required to cooperate with Itron to secure the financing to the extent
such cooperation would require Silver Spring or any of its subsidiaries to take any action that would interfere unreasonably and
materially with the operations of Silver Spring or any of its subsidiaries. The obligations of Silver Spring and its subsidiaries are
subject to certain other exceptions more fully described in the merger agreement.

Employee Benefits Matters

From the effective time of the merger until 12 months thereafter (or if earlier, until the date of termination of the applicable
continuing employee), Itron will, and will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to, provide each employee of Silver
Spring or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time of the merger that remains an employee of Itron, the
surviving corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries following the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as a
“continuing employee”) with (i) at least the same level of base salary or base hourly wage levels, if applicable, that was provided to
such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, (ii) target cash incentive compensation
opportunities (excluding any one-time, stay, retention, transaction or other discretionary bonuses) that are at least equal with respect
to individual target bonus levels to that provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
(iii) subject to the requirements of applicable law for continuing employees outside of the United States, employee health, welfare
and tax-qualified defined contribution retirement benefits (other than equity-based awards, defined benefit and non-qualified
arrangements) that are in the aggregate substantially comparable to either (A) such employee benefits that are provided to similarly-
situated employees of Itron or its affiliates or (B) such employee benefits offered to such continuing employees immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger, and (iv) upon an involuntary termination without cause of a continuing employee, severance
benefits that are required by applicable law, or if none, that are no less favorable than those that would have been provided to each
such continuing employee under the disclosed employee benefit plans that are severance benefit plans, programs, policies or
arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. In the event Silver Spring has not then made a
determination of bonus amounts to be paid and paid such amounts due under its 2017 annual bonus or incentive plan as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, Itron will cause each employee of Silver Spring or any of its subsidiaries who
is a participant in Silver Spring’s 2017 annual bonus or incentive plan to be paid a bonus in respect of the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2017 in accordance with the terms of such plan as in effect on September 17, 2017, as if the applicable performance
targets were fully achieved at target levels, except that Itron reserves the right to cause such bonuses to be paid solely in cash.

With respect to employee benefit plans in which continuing employees participate in following the consummation of the merger,
continuing employees will generally receive credit for their service with Silver Spring and its

subsidiaries and any predecessor employer (to the extent Silver Spring and its subsidiaries recognized or provided such past service
credit) prior to the effective time, to the same extent that was recognized under Silver Spring benefit plans under any corresponding
Itron employee benefit plan, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and, with respect to vacation, sick time or paid time
off, accrual and severance pay entitlement; provided that such service will not be credited to the extent that it would result in
duplication of coverage or benefits, or with respect to employees outside of the United States if applicable foreign law would forbid
the provision of such service credit. To the extent permitted by applicable law and the insurer or service provider under Itron’s
employee welfare plans or arrangements, Itron will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
limitations, participation waiting periods or similar requirements that would be applicable to be waived, and all co-payments or
deductibles paid by Silver Spring employees for eligible expenses in the plan year in which the closing occurs to be credited for
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket requirement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the merger agreement, nothing in the merger agreement will be deemed to (i)
guarantee employment for any period of any time, or preclude the ability of Itron, the surviving corporation or their subsidiaries to
terminate any continuing employee for any reasons, (ii) prevent the modification or termination of any agreement with a continuing
employee after the effective time of merger agreement, or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee, officer,
director, consultant, or other service provider of Silver Spring or any of its subsidiaries.

Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance

For a period of six years after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Itron will
cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of Silver Spring and its
subsidiaries under any and all (i) indemnification agreements between Silver Spring and any of its subsidiaries identified in the
confidential disclosure letter that Silver Spring delivered to Itron in connection with the execution of the merger agreement and (A)
any of their respective current or former directors and officers as of September 17, 2017 pursuant to the terms of such agreements as
in effect of such date, and (B) any person who becomes a director or officer of Silver Spring or any of its subsidiaries prior to the
effective time of the merger and executes an indemnification agreement on terms no less favorable to Silver Spring and no more
favorable to such person than the current form of indemnification agreement with its directors that has been made available to Itron
(for the purposes of the merger agreement, each, an “indemnified party”) and (ii) indemnification, expense advancement and
exculpation provisions in any certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable organizational document of Silver Spring or any
of its subsidiaries in effect as of September 17, 2017. In addition, for a period of six years after the effective time of the merger, the
surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Itron will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the surviving corporation and its
subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are no less
favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses than such provisions set forth in the certificates
of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of Silver Spring and its subsidiaries as of September 17,
2017, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the effective time of the
merger in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the effective time of the
merger, were indemnified parties.

Additionally, Silver Spring has agreed to obtain, prior to the effective time of the merger, runoff insurance coverage with a claims
period of at least six years from the effective time of the merger for the benefit of Silver Spring, its subsidiaries, Silver Spring’s and
its subsidiaries’ past and present directors and/or officers that are insured under Silver Spring’s directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policy that was in effect as of the date of the merger agreement. Such insurance will provide coverage for Silver Spring,
its subsidiaries and such persons in their capacity as directors, officers and/or employees of Silver Spring or of any of its
subsidiaries prior to the effective time that is no less favorable in the aggregate as Silver Spring’s existing policies or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage. The surviving corporation’s expenses to obtain or
maintain such insurance policies will not exceed an amount per year equal to 300% of the last annual premium paid by Silver Spring
prior to the date of the merger agreement for such insurance, or as much coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies
for such maximum annual amount in aggregate annual premiums.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In the event of the merger or consolidation of Itron or the surviving corporation with any other person or entity (and Itron is not the
continuing or surviving corporation of such merger), or if Itron or the surviving corporation transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Itron or the surviving corporation, as the case may be, will assume all of the foregoing indemnification and insurance
obligations.

Stockholder Litigation

Silver Spring has agreed to promptly advise Itron of the commencement of any action brought by Silver Spring stockholders or any
holders of any capital or equity interest in any subsidiary of Silver Spring (on their own behalf or on the behalf of Silver Spring or
any of its subsidiaries or otherwise as a class action) against Silver Spring, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective directors
(in their capacity as such) arising out of or relating to the merger agreement, the process leading to the merger agreement or the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including (but not limited to) claims based on alleged breach of fiduciary
duties, improper or insufficient disclosure and/or appraisal demands and proceedings. Silver Spring has further agreed to give Itron
the right to participate in the defense, settlement or compromise of any such actions or related investigation against Silver Spring
and/or its directors relating to the merger or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and will obtain Itron’s written
consent prior to settling or satisfying any such actions or investigation (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). Itron will be
kept reasonably apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to such actions or investigation by Silver
Spring (to the extent that attorney-client privilege between Silver Spring and its counsel is not waived), and Itron may offer
comments or suggestions with respect to any such actions or investigation but will not be afforded any decision-making power or
other authority over such actions or investigations, except for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above. Silver Spring
will in good faith take such comments into account and no such settlement will be agreed to without Itron’s prior written consent.

The merger agreement contains certain other covenants and agreements, including covenants relating to:

• cooperation between Silver Spring and Itron in the preparation and filing of this proxy statement;

• reasonable access to information about Silver Spring that will be made available upon Itron’s request;

of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting in favor of the
merger proposal, in the following ways:

agreement until the date specified in such request that is not later than June 17, 2018; provided that such right to

the closing), Silver Spring has confirmed to Itron and Merger Sub in writing that it is ready and able to consummate
the merger and Itron and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the merger (due to the failure of the financing to
have timely occurred in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement) within 20 business days following the
date the closing should have occurred (except Silver Spring may not exercise this termination right if it is then in
material breach of the merger agreement and until 24 hours after the expiration of such 20 business day period).

If the merger agreement is validly terminated pursuant to the termination rights described above, the merger agreement will become
void and of no further force or effect and there will be no liability or obligation on the part of any party, except for the
confidentiality provisions, provisions relating to the effect of termination and fees and expenses (including the termination fees
described in the section entitled “—Termination Fee” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement) and certain other specified
general provisions of the merger

agreement, each of which will survive the termination of the merger agreement. The parties have further agreed that nothing in the
merger agreement, including the termination of the merger agreement, will relieve any party from liability or damages resulting
from fraud or any willful breach of the merger agreement prior to the date of its termination, in which case the non-breaching party
will be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity.

For the purposes of the merger agreement, “willful breach” means, with respect to any breaches or failures to perform any of the
covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement, a material breach that is a consequence of an act or failure to act
undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge (after reasonable inquiry) that such act or failure to act would reasonably be
expected to result in or constitute a breach of the merger agreement.

Termination Fee

Under the merger agreement, Silver Spring is required to pay Itron a termination fee of $32.3 million in cash if the merger
agreement is terminated under the following circumstances:

• If the merger agreement is terminated:

• by either Itron or Silver Spring because the merger has not been consummated by the termination date;

• by either Itron or Silver Spring because the special meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof) has
concluded, the Silver Spring stockholders have duly voted and the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
majority of all outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock at such meeting in favor of the merger proposal was
not obtained; or

• by Itron because of inaccuracies or breaches of the representations and warranties of Silver Spring, or breaches of the
covenants of Silver Spring that cannot be cured by the termination date or, if capable of being so cured, Silver Spring
has failed to cure such breach within 20 days after Silver Spring has received written notice of such breach from Itron
(but only if terminated as a result of a breach by Silver Spring of its covenants or obligations, and not its
representations or warranties, such that the corresponding closing condition would not be satisfied); and

• (i) following the execution and delivery of the merger agreement and prior to any such termination of the merger
agreement, a competing acquisition transaction has been publicly announced or has become publicly disclosed and
was not publicly withdrawn at least ten business days prior to such termination, and (ii) concurrently with or within
12 months following any such termination of the merger agreement, Silver Spring or any of its affiliates either (A)
consummates a competing acquisition transaction or (B) enters into a definitive agreement for a competing
acquisition transaction, in each case, whether or not the competing acquisition transaction was the same competing
acquisition transaction referred to in clause (i); provided that for purposes of the merger agreement, “competing
acquisition transaction” has the same meaning as “acquisition transaction” except that all references in therein to
“15%” will be deemed to be references to “50%.”

• Itron terminates the merger agreement, at any time prior to receiving the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
majority of all outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting in favor of the
merger proposal, because the Silver Spring board of directors (i) effects a company board recommendation change or fails
to include the company board recommendation in this proxy statement, (ii) fails to publicly reconfirm the company board
recommendation as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten business days) after receipt of a
written request from Itron that it do so if such request is made following (A) the making by any person, entity or group of
an acquisition proposal that has become publicly known or (B) any person, entity or group having publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make an acquisition proposal or the existence of an intention to make an
acquisition proposal has otherwise become publicly known, (iii) a tender or exchange offer for Silver Spring common
stock that constitutes an acquisition proposal (whether or not a superior proposal) is commenced by a person or entity
unaffiliated with Itron and, within ten business days after the public announcement of the commencement of such
acquisition proposal, Silver Spring has not have filed a Schedule 14D-9 pursuant to Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act recommending that the Silver Spring stockholders reject such acquisition

proposal and not tender any shares of Silver Spring common stock into such tender or exchange offer, or (iv) Silver Spring
has breached its non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement or the obligation of the Silver Spring board of
directors to make the company board recommendation, in which case Silver Spring must pay the termination fee to Itron
within two business days after such termination of the merger agreement by Itron; or

• Silver Spring terminates the merger agreement prior to receiving the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority
of all outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting in favor of the merger
proposal, if the Silver Spring board of directors effects a company board recommendation change in compliance with the
merger agreement, to enter into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of a superior proposal (provided
that Silver Spring has not violated its non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement or the obligation of the
Silver Spring board of directors to make the company board recommendation) (see “—No Solicitation by Silver Spring of
Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Board Recommendation” beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement), in which case
Silver Spring must pay the termination fee to Itron simultaneously with, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, such
termination of the merger agreement by Silver Spring.

In no event will Silver Spring be required to pay the termination fee in connection with the termination of the merger agreement on
more than one occasion.

The parties have agreed that, in the event the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances where the termination fee would
be payable, the payment of the termination fee to Itron, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, will be Itron’s sole
and exclusive remedy for any loss it or Merger Sub suffers as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement to be consummated, the termination of the merger agreement, any liabilities or obligations arising under the merger
agreement or any claims or actions arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of or under the merger agreement,
except that there is no limit to liability for any losses resulting from fraud or willful breach of the merger agreement by Silver
Spring, as described above in the section entitled “—Termination; Effect of Termination” beginning on page 99 of this proxy
statement.

Fees and Expenses

All out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing sources, hedging
counterparties, experts and consultants) incurred in connection with the merger agreement, the transactions contemplated thereby,
the solicitation of stockholder approvals and all other matters related to the consummation of the merger, will be paid by the party or
parties, as applicable, incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement are consummated, with certain exceptions expressly set forth in the merger agreement. Silver Spring and Itron
have agreed to pay one-half of the filing fees and the costs of filings made pursuant to antitrust laws and of printing and mailing this
proxy statement.

Specific Performance

The parties have agreed, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any party of any of its respective covenants or
obligations set forth in the merger agreement, that the non-breaching parties will be entitled, without the requirement for posting a
bond, to an order of specific performance to enforce the performance of any covenant or obligation contained in the merger
agreement and an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach of the merger agreement.

Third-Party Beneficiaries

The merger agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any other person or entity any rights or remedies under the
merger agreement, except (i) from and after the effective time of the merger, as set forth in the provisions of the merger agreement
providing for indemnification of Silver Spring directors and officers, as discussed in the section entitled “—Directors’ and Officers’
Indemnification and Insurance” beginning on page 96 of this proxy statement, (ii) from and after the effective time of the merger,

(associated with a failure of the financing to timely occur) (whether or not the merger agreement has been terminated pursuant to its
terms), and (iv) certain sections of the merger agreement for which the financing sources are express third-party beneficiaries.

Amendments; Waivers

The merger agreement may be amended by the parties at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of Itron, Merger Sub and Silver Spring. However, after the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock, no amendment may be
made that requires the approval of such Silver Spring stockholders under Delaware law without such approval. In addition, certain
provisions of the merger agreement relating to the financing may not be amended in a manner that is adverse to any financing
source or any of its affiliates or representatives without the prior written consent of such financing source.

At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, any party may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of any
other party contained in the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the merger agreement and (c) waive
compliance with any agreement of any other party or any condition to its own obligations contained in the merger agreement. Any
such extension or waiver will be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The
failure of any party to assert any of its rights under the merger agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Governing Law; Jurisdiction

The merger agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The parties have agreed
that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with
the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby (whether brought by any party to the merger agreement or any of its
affiliates or against any party to the merger agreement or any of its affiliates) will be heard and determined exclusively in the Court
of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or a federal court of the United States located within the State of Delaware), and the parties
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court for the purpose of such suit, action or proceeding.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party has agreed that any legal proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party
claim of any kind or description against the financing sources in any way relating to the merger agreement or the financing or any of
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the financing, including any dispute relating to the amended commitment
letter or performance thereunder, are governed by the laws set forth in the amended commitment letter.

TERMS OF THE VOTING AGREEMENT

The following summary describes certain material provisions of the voting agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the voting agreement included as Annex D to this proxy statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not
contain all of the information about the voting agreement that may be important to you.

In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Warren Weiss, a stockholder and a member of the Silver Spring board of
directors, and certain other stockholders affiliated with Mr. Weiss, entered into a voting agreement with Itron. As of the close of
business on the record date for the special meeting, Silver Spring stockholders subject to the voting agreement beneficially own
approximately 19.5% of the outstanding shares of Silver Spring common stock.

Voting Provisions

Each Silver Spring stockholder that is a party to the voting agreement with Itron has irrevocably and unconditionally agreed to cause
such stockholder’s shares of Silver Spring common stock to be counted for the purpose of calculating a quorum at any meeting of
Silver Spring stockholders and to vote (i) in favor of, and otherwise support, the merger and the adoption of the merger agreement,
(ii) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone any such meeting of Silver Spring stockholders if there are not sufficient votes to
adopt the merger agreement, (iii) in favor of any other matter reasonably relating to the consummation or facilitation of, or
otherwise in furtherance of, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (iv) against any
acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction and (v) against any other action, proposal, agreement, transaction or arrangement
submitted for approval of Silver Spring’s stockholders that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere or be
inconsistent with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the consummation of the merger, including, without limitation,
any extraordinary transaction, merger, consolidation, sale of assets, recapitalization or other business combination including Silver
Spring, or any other action, agreement or arrangement that could reasonably be expected to result in a material breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Silver Spring under the merger agreement or that could
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the obligations under the merger agreement not being fulfilled or
satisfied.

Appraisal Rights

Each Silver Spring stockholder that is a party to the voting agreement with Itron has agreed to irrevocably and unconditionally
waive any rights of appraisal or rights to dissent from the merger that such stockholder may have (including under Section 262 of

agreement in accordance with its terms (as described below), such stockholder will not, directly or indirectly, (i) sell, pledge,
encumber, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any or all of such stockholder’s shares of Silver Spring common stock or any
interest in such shares (other than any pledge or encumbrance currently in existence), (ii) deposit such stockholder’s shares of Silver
Spring common stock or any interest in such shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect
to any of such stockholder’s shares or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto (other than as contemplated herein)
or (iii) enter into any contract with respect to or otherwise agree to the direct or indirect acquisition or sale, pledge, encumbrance,
assignment, transfer or other disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to hedging, cash
settlement or otherwise) of any of such stockholder’s shares of Silver Spring common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the

case of a stockholder that is a natural person, (A) to a family member or a trust solely for the benefit of such stockholder or a family
member, (B) upon death to such stockholder’s heirs or (C) to a charitable entity qualified as a 501(c)(3) organization under the

PROPOSAL 2: APPROVAL OF ADJOURNMENT OF SPECIAL MEETING

Silver Spring stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal providing for the adjournment of the special meeting if necessary
or appropriate in the view of the Silver Spring board of directors to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the
time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger, and to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by Silver Spring stockholders
prior to the special meeting.

In this proposal, we are asking you to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Silver Spring board of directors to vote in
favor of adjourning the special meeting, and any later adjournments, to another time and place. If Silver Spring stockholders
approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the special meeting in any of the circumstances described above, and any
adjourned session of the special meeting, to a later date and use the additional time to, among other things, solicit additional proxies
in favor of the merger proposal, including the solicitation of proxies from holders of Silver Spring common stock that have
previously voted against the merger proposal. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if
we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the merger proposal, we could adjourn the special meeting
without a vote on the merger proposal and seek to convince the holders of those shares of Silver Spring common stock to change
their votes to votes in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger.

The Silver Spring board of directors believes that if the number of shares of Silver Spring common stock present at the special
meeting and voting in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger is not sufficient to adopt the merger
agreement and approve the merger, it is in the best interests of the holders of Silver Spring common stock to enable the Silver
Spring board of directors to continue to seek to obtain a sufficient number of additional votes to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the merger. In addition, under the merger agreement, Silver Spring could be required to adjourn the special meeting for up
to ten business days if the number of shares of Silver Spring common stock present at the special meeting and voting in favor of
adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger is not sufficient to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
merger.

The vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger proposal. Accordingly, you may vote
to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the adjournment proposal and vice versa. Under our bylaws, as amended,
the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Silver Spring common stock that
are present at the special meeting and voting for or against the proposal (assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting).
Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, and shares not in attendance will have no effect on the approval of the adjournment
proposal (unless, with respect to shares not in attendance, such shares are necessary to satisfy the requirement that a quorum be
present at the special meeting).

If the special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their
proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use.

The Silver Spring board of directors recommends that Silver Spring stockholders vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

Corporation and such bylaws (subject to the provisions of Section 6.10(a)).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(ii) Excluded Company Common Stock. Each Share owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, or by any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Acquisition Sub or by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the
Company, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Cancelled Company Shares”), shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(iii) Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub. Each share of common stock of Acquisition Sub that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of
Acquisition Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Adjustment to the Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect appropriately
the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Company Common Stock but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the granting or other issuance of Company Options,
Company RSUs or Company PSUs in the ordinary course of business), reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time, and to provide to the converting holders herein the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, provided, that nothing in this Section 2.7(b) shall be construed as
permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

(c) Statutory Rights of Appraisal.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall neither have voted in favor of the
Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of
appraisal in respect of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, “Dissenting Company
Shares”) shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.7(a), but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Company Shares. At
the Effective Time, the Dissenting Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and cease to exist, and each Company Stockholder who holds Dissenting Company Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; provided that all Dissenting Company Shares held by
Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer be considered to be
Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.8.

(ii) The Company shall provide Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company
in respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to consult with the Company concerning, and to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to, demands for appraisal under Delaware Law in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

(d) Company Options.

(i) Unvested In-the-Money Company Options. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any holder of a Company

TABLE OF CONTENTS

that remains outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that has a per share exercise price
that is less than the Merger Consideration, and that is held by a then-current service provider, shall be assumed by Parent
at the Effective Time and shall be converted into and become an option to acquire Parent Common Stock (each, an
“Adjusted Option”), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the corresponding Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as follows:

(A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Adjusted Option shall be determined by
multiplying the number of Shares that were subject to the corresponding unvested Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock;

(B) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Adjusted Option
shall be determined by dividing the applicable per share exercise price of the corresponding Company Option, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to
the nearest whole cent; and

(C) any restriction on the exercise of any Adjusted Option shall continue in full force and effect and the term,
exercisability, vesting schedule, accelerated vesting rights, and other provisions of such Company Option shall
otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption of such Company Option, in each case except to the extent
otherwise provided in any Stock Plan, or any stock option, employment, change of control or other agreement
between the holder of a Company Option and the Company; provided that Parent’s board of directors or a committee
thereof shall succeed as to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board or any committee thereof with
respect to any Adjusted Option.

The adjustments to the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Adjusted Options
determined under the mechanic set forth in this Section 2.7(d)(i) shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 and Section 409A of the Code.

(ii) Vested In-the-Money Company Options. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any holder of a Company Option, each
Company Option that remains outstanding and is vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that has a per
share exercise price that is less than the Merger Consideration, shall not be assumed by Parent and shall instead be
cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for a payment by Parent of an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
aggregate number of Shares subject to such vested Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price under such vested Company Option. As of the Effective Time,
each holder of a vested Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
foregoing consideration.

(iii) Out-of-the-Money Company Options. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,

instead be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for a payment by Parent of an amount in cash equal to the product
of (x) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Non-Employee Director Option

(including each Company 2017 PSU as to which the performance criteria has been satisfied or deemed satisfied under
Section  2.7(g) of this Agreement and that is held by a then-current service provider) shall be assumed by Parent at the
Effective Time, (each, an “Adjusted RSU”) and shall be converted into a restricted stock unit to receive, on substantially
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the corresponding Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of Shares that were subject to the
corresponding Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding
the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. Any restriction on the
settlement of any Adjusted RSU shall continue in full force and effect and the term, settlement terms, vesting schedule
(subject to any vesting acceleration terms contained in an applicable Employee Plan set forth on Section 3.17(k) of the
Company Disclosure Letter) and other material provisions of the corresponding Company RSU or Company 2017 PSU

Parent and shall be cancelled and automatically be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger

is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Non-Employee Director RSU”), whether vested or
unvested, shall not be assumed by Parent and shall instead become fully vested as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and then cancelled and automatically be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash for each Share subject to such Non-Employee Director RSU. As of the Effective Time, each holder
of a Non-Employee Director RSU shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash for each Share subject to such Non-Employee Director RSU.

provided in Sections 2.7(d), (e) and (g), and (ii) if requested by Parent, the Company Board shall adopt any resolutions as may

(b) Exchange Fund. At or promptly following the Closing, but on the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be

amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock (other than Cancelled
Shares, Dissenting Shares and Shares subject to Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs) become entitled
under this Article II. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall be
invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation (such cash amount being referred to herein
as the “Exchange Fund”). Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent
that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by this Article II, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent
to make such payments contemplated by this Article II.

(c) Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates
(the “Certificates”) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares and (ii) uncertificated
Shares (the “Uncertificated Shares”), in each case, whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7 (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent),
and/or (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
aggregate number of Shares represented by such Certificate that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7, by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in
respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the
Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Shares represented by
such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.7, by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates
and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.8. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

(d) Transfers of Ownership. In the event that a transfer of ownership of Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid
to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, or established to the
satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

(e) Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Shares, Company
Options, Company RSUs, Company PSUs and purchase rights under the Company ESPP such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted, withheld and
remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

the Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Shares for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is nine months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand, and any holders of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore surrendered their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such Shares for exchange pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.8 shall thereafter look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent, as general unsecured creditors thereof, for any claim
to the applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

2.9 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
theretofore representing any Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.8. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

2.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Payment Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7; provided that Parent or the Payment
Agent may, in its discretion and as condition to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such customary and reasonable amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.11 Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation and Acquisition Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary action.

transactions contemplated hereby or the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder.

3.6 Company Capitalization.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 1,000,000,000 Shares and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of

to fees and related arrangements with respect to the Financing Commitments (provided that the provisions in the Financing

redacted so long as no redaction covers terms that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the amount or availability
or conditionality of the Financing), pursuant to which, and

subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Lenders have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent for the
purpose of funding the Merger (such committed financing, together with (if applicable), unless the context otherwise requires,
any debt securities issued in lieu thereof, the “Financing”).

(b) As of the Agreement Date, (i) the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect (subject to the Enforceability
Limitations), and have not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and (ii)
each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable against it or them, as the case may be, in accordance with its
terms except as enforceability may be affected by the Enforceability Limitations. As of the Agreement Date there are, and,
subject to the provisions of Section 6.16, as of the Closing there will be, no other agreements, side letters, or arrangements
relating to the Financing Commitments that could affect the amount, availability or conditionality of the Financing other than
as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments and the Fee Letters.

(c) As of the Agreement Date, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material default or breach on the part of Parent under any term or condition of the Financing Commitments or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, would (i) result in any of the conditions in the Financing Commitments not being satisfied by the
Closing Date or (ii) otherwise result in the Financing not being available on the Closing Date. As of the Agreement Date,
assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII, and based on facts and events that Parent has Knowledge of,
Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all material terms and conditions of the
Financing Commitments to be satisfied by it or the Lenders, or that the Financing will not be available on the Closing Date. As
of the Agreement Date, no Lender party to any Financing Commitment has notified Parent of its intention to terminate any of
the Financing Commitments or not to provide the Financing.

(d) Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing
Commitments to be paid on or before the Agreement Date. The aggregate net proceeds from the Financing constitute all of the
financing required for the consummation of the Merger and, together with cash and cash equivalents of Parent, are sufficient in
amount for Parent to (i) pay all amounts payable by it or Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Merger under this Agreement, (ii) pay
all associated fees, costs and expenses in connection with the Merger, including the Financing, (iii) repay (or refinance
pursuant to a credit facility that will permit the Merger and Financing) all outstanding borrowings and other payment
obligations under the Existing Parent Credit Agreement if the consent or waiver described in Section 6.16(b) is not obtained,
and (iv) repay, retire and redeem in full all Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth in Section 3.12(a)(viii)
of the Company Disclosure Letter (the “Required Amount”). The Financing Commitments and Fee Letters contain all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent on the terms set forth
therein. Parent acknowledges that its obligation to consummate the Merger is not contingent on Parent’s ability to obtain any
financing whether pursuant to the Financing Commitments or otherwise.

4.11 Non-Reliance; Exclusivity of Representations.

(a) In connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and Acquisition Sub and their respective
Affiliates, stockholders, Representatives, or advisors, Parent and Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
Representatives, and advisors have received and may continue to receive after the Agreement Date (including pursuant to
Section 6.8) from the Company and its Affiliates, stockholders, Representatives, and advisors certain estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its
business and operations. Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business plans, that Parent
and Acquisition Sub are making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans). Accordingly,
Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, stockholders, Representatives, or advisors, nor any other Person, has made

looking statements or business plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,

Sub (or any other Person) makes, or has made, any representation or warranty relating to Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of
their Affiliates or any of their respective businesses or operations or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the

representation or warranty relating to Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective businesses
or operations or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including as to the
accuracy or completeness thereof, and if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon by the Company or any
of its Affiliates or any Representatives of any of the foregoing as having been authorized by Parent or Acquisition Sub or any
of their Affiliates (or any other Person on their behalf).

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such Person, on the other, unless the Company Board and/or any
authorized committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law.

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.2(b), the Company shall promptly (and in any

submitted by the Company in response to any comments or inquiries from the SEC or the staff thereof and shall provide Parent
a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any written response to any such written comments of the SEC or
its staff relating to the Proxy Statement and include in such response all reasonable comments proposed by Parent in good faith.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as
promptly as practicable.

(e) Unless the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall have effected a Company Board
Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.5, the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement.

(a) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and
hold a special meeting of the Company Stockholders (or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the “Company
Stockholder Meeting”), for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval and approve the Merger in
accordance with the DGCL. Once the Company has established the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting, the
Company shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required by applicable Law. The
Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, shall cooperate with Parent to
initially schedule the Company Stockholder Meeting to be held no earlier than 30 days and no later than 50 days after the
mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company, and shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the Company from
postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting:

(i) For sequential periods of up to five Business Days each, if there are holders of insufficient Shares present or
represented by a proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder
Meeting;

(ii) For so long as the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable
Law, or an Order from the SEC or its staff;

(iii) For up to five Business Days, if the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting in order to give Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or
disclosure that the Company has sent to Company Stockholders or otherwise made available to Company Stockholders by
issuing a press release, filing materials with the SEC or otherwise (including in connection with any Company Board
Recommendation Change); or

(iv) For one time only, for up to 10 Business Days from the date on which the Company Stockholder Meeting was
initially scheduled if, on a date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(b) Without the prior written consent of Parent, a proposal for the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), and any matters related thereto, shall be the only matters
which the Company shall propose to be acted on at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

(c) Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company shall solicit from the
Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger in accordance with
Delaware Law, submit this Agreement for adoption by the Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting and,
unless the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation
Change pursuant to Section 6.5(b), use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder Approval for the adoption
of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

6.5 Company Board Recommendation.

(a) Subject to Section 6.5(c), the Company Board shall make the Company Board Recommendation.

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (x) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Board Recommendation, (y) approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or (z) fail to recommend
against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for Shares within 10 Business Days after the commencement of such
offer (each of clauses (x), (y) and (z), a “Company Board Recommendation Change”); provided that a “stop, look and
listen” communication by the Company Board to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or
any substantially similar communication, shall not be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof may make a Company Board
Recommendation Change if and only if:

(i) (A) the Company has received an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not arise or result
from a breach of Section  5.2, that constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn
and continues to be a Superior Proposal;

(B) the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to enter into a definitive agreement
relating to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
Delaware Law;

(C) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing of the Superior Proposal and that it intends to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change, including providing Parent with the identity of the Person making such
Superior Proposal and a copy of the then-current forms of all of the relevant proposed transaction documents related
thereto, including definitive agreements (including financing agreements, if any) with respect to such Superior
Proposal (a “Superior Proposal Notice”); provided that with respect to any amendment to the financial terms or
other material terms of such Superior Proposal, Parent shall be entitled to a new written notice by the Company (a
“Superior Proposal Amendment Notice”);

(D) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its Representatives available to discuss with Parent’s
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the period
beginning as soon as practicable on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such Superior Proposal Notice
or such Superior Proposal Amendment Notice, as applicable, and ending at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on, in the case of
a Superior Proposal Notice, the fourth Business Day following the day of such delivery or, in the case of a Superior
Proposal Amendment Notice, the second Business Day following the day of such delivery (provided that such two
Business day period shall be extended if applicable through the end of the original four (4) Business Day period);

(E) the Company has during such four Business Day period or such two Business Day period, as applicable,
negotiated, and caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) with respect to proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

(F) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company during such four Business Day period or such two Business
Day period, as applicable, a written offer to modify the terms of this Agreement that if accepted by the Company in
accordance with the terms thereof would be binding upon Parent, the Company Board and/or any authorized
committee thereof shall have determined in good faith, after considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the
Superior Proposal giving rise to such Superior Proposal Notice or such Superior Proposal Amendment Notice, as
applicable, still constitutes a Superior Proposal and that, in light of such Superior Proposal and the results of any
negotiations with Parent and any offer from Parent, that the failure of the Company Board to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law; or

(ii) (A) an Intervening Event has occurred;

(B) the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in
light of such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Company Board members’ fiduciary duties under
Delaware Law;

(C) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing of such Intervening Event, including a reasonable
description of such Intervening Event, and that it intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change (an
“Intervening Event Notice”);

(D) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its Representatives available to discuss with Parent’s
Representatives the Intervening Event and any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
during the period beginning as soon as practicable on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such
Intervening Event Notice and ending at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the fourth Business Day following the day of such
delivery;

(E) the Company has during such four Business Day period negotiated, and caused its financial and legal
advisors to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to proposed
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the failure to make such Company Board
Recommendation Change is no longer a breach of the Company Board’s fiduciary duties; and

(F) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company during such four Business Day period a written offer to
modify the terms of this Agreement that if accepted by the Company in accordance with the terms thereof would be
binding upon Parent, the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good
faith, after considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation
Change in light of such Intervening Event would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof from taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying
with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act (including making any “stop, look and listen”
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its
position thereunder); provided that, (x) Section 6.5(d) shall not in and of itself permit the Company Board and/or any
authorized committee thereof to make a Company Board Recommendation Change that would not otherwise be permitted
pursuant to this Section 6.5, and (y) in any such case, any such statement(s) or disclosures made by the Company Board and/or
any authorized committee thereof will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the provisions of
Section 6.5 and Article VIII.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

6.6 Public Statements and Disclosure. The initial press release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement
shall be a joint press release reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company prior to the Agreement Date. None of the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue any public release or make any public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of
the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or regulatory or
Governmental Authority to which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance and shall give due consideration to such comments (it being
understood that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or
announcement, shall be at the final reasonable discretion of the disclosing party); provided that the restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.6 shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made by the Company or Parent in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal, a Company Board Recommendation Change or Superior Proposal.

6.7 Anti-Takeover Laws. In the event that any anti-takeover or other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law
on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.8 Access. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until
the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company shall afford
Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books and
records and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and the Company’s outside accountant); provided that the Company
may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information (i) to the extent that any applicable Law requires the
Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information, (ii) to the extent that access to such documents
or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege applicable to such documents or information, or (iii) pursuant to mutually agreed “clean team” procedures established by
the parties, to the extent that access to such documents or information could potentially be used by Parent in a manner that would
materially alter the competitive dynamic between Company and Parent if the Merger were not consummated; provided, further, that
no information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section
6.8 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or otherwise
impair the rights and remedies available to Parent and Acquisition Sub hereunder. In the event that the Company does not provide
access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable
information to Parent in a way that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or to waive such a privilege,
including, to the extent practicable, by providing such information in redacted form as necessary to preserve such a privilege or
comply with such Law or otherwise make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent possible. Any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8 shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any
property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of any applicable Lease and the Company’s reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements and shall not include the right to perform invasive Phase 1 or Phase 2 environmental assessments or other invasive
testing. The terms and conditions of the confidentiality letter agreement dated May 8, 2017 between the Company and Parent (the
“Confidentiality Agreement”), shall apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with
any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8. Nothing in this Section 6.8 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the foregoing to
prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information.

6.9 Section 16(b) Exemption. The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

6.10 Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under any and all (i) indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries identified in
Section 3.12(a)(xiv) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (x) any of their respective current or former directors and officers
as of the Agreement Date pursuant to the terms of such agreements as in effect as of the Agreement Date, and (y) any person
who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and executes an
indemnification agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company and no more favorable to such person than the current
form of indemnification agreement with its directors that has been made available to Parent (the “Indemnified Persons”) and
(ii) indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provisions in any certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
comparable organizational document of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the Agreement Date. In addition,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions contained in the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Agreement
Date, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner
adverse to the Indemnified Persons except as required by applicable Law. Any claims for indemnification made under this
Section 6.10 on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive such anniversary until the final resolution
thereof, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its applicable Subsidiaries to maintain sufficient funds for the
payment of their respective obligations to the Indemnified Persons under this Section 6.10(a).

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall bind and purchase directors and officers runoff insurance coverage in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (“D&O Runoff Insurance”), which by its terms shall
survive the Merger for not less than six years and covering each Person covered by the Company’s current directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policy in effect as of the Agreement Date (which has been made available to Parent) (the “Current
D&O Insurance”). The D&O Runoff Insurance shall be on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are
substantially equivalent to those of the Current D&O Insurance or, if substantially equivalent insurance is unavailable, the best
available coverage. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain the D&O
Runoff Insurance in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such D&O Runoff
Insurance shall be maintained in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be permitted or
required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Runoff Insurance in excess of 300% (the “Maximum Amount”) of the last
annual premium paid prior to the Agreement Date for the Current D&O Insurance (it being understood and agreed that in the
event the cost of such D&O Runoff Insurance exceeds the Maximum Amount, in the aggregate, the Company shall remain
obligated to provide, and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to maintain, the broadest D&O Runoff Insurance
coverage as may be obtained for the Maximum Amount). The Company and Indemnified Parties may be required to make
reasonable application and provide reasonable and customary representations and warranties to applicable insurance carriers
for the purpose of obtaining such D&O Runoff Insurance.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such

consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10.

(d) The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner
that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other Person who is a beneficiary under the D&O Runoff Insurance (and
their heirs and Representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other Person who is a
beneficiary under the D&O Runoff Insurance (and their heirs and Representatives). The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and
other Persons who are beneficiaries under the D&O Runoff Insurance (and their heirs and Representatives)) under this Section
6.10 shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such Persons may have under the certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’
and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

(f) Each of the Indemnified Persons or other Persons who are beneficiaries under the D&O Runoff Insurance (and their
heirs and Representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if
a party thereto.

(g) This Section 6.10 shall survive the consummation of the Merger.

6.11 Employee Matters.

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof to, for a period ending on the date
that is 12 months following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the date of termination of the applicable Continuing Employee),
provide the Continuing Employees with (i) at least the same level of base salary or base hourly wage levels, if applicable, that
were provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target cash incentive compensation
opportunities (excluding any one-time stay, retention, transaction or other discretionary bonuses) that are at least equal with
respect to individual target bonus levels to that provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (iii) subject to the requirements of applicable Law in jurisdictions outside of the United States, employee health, welfare
and tax-qualified defined contribution retirement benefits (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, equity-based awards, defined
benefit, and non-qualified arrangements) that are in the aggregate substantially comparable to either (A) the employee health,
welfare and tax-qualified defined contribution retirement benefits (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, equity-based awards,
defined benefit, and non-qualified arrangements) offered to similarly situated employees of Parent or Parent’s Affiliates (each,
a “Parent Plan”), or (B) the employee health, welfare and tax-qualified defined contribution retirement benefits (excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, equity-based awards, defined benefit, and non-qualified arrangements) offered to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, as disclosed in Section 6.11(a)(iii)(B) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
with the determination of the employee benefits and their comparability under this clause (iii) to be reasonably made by Parent
from time to time, and (iv) upon an involuntary termination without cause of a Continuing Employee, severance benefits that
are required by applicable Law, or, if none, that are no less favorable than those that would have been provided to each such
Continuing Employee under the applicable Employee Plans that are severance benefit plans, programs, policies or
arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, as disclosed in Section 6.11(a)(iv) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (such payments and benefits, the “Transaction Severance Benefits”), in all cases (i) through (iv), as
measured on an individual basis. In the event the Company has not then made a determination of bonus amounts to be paid and
paid such amounts due under its 2017 annual bonus or incentive plan as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is a participant in the Company’s

2017 annual bonus or incentive plan to be paid a bonus in respect of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 in accordance
with the terms of such plan as in effect on the Agreement Date, as if the applicable performance targets were fully achieved at
target levels, except that Parent reserves the right to cause such bonuses to be paid solely in cash.

(b) With respect to the employee health and welfare benefit plans and defined contribution retirement plans of Parent and
its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees participate following the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to, cause to be granted to each Continuing Employee credit for all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any predecessor employer (to the extent the Company and its Subsidiaries recognized or
provided such past service credit) prior to the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and, with respect to vacation, sick time or paid time
off, accrual and severance pay entitlement); provided that such service will not be credited to the extent that it would result in
duplication of coverage or benefits, or with respect to employees outside of the United States if applicable foreign Law would
forbid the provision of such service credit. For purposes of each Parent Plan in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate after Closing, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one
of its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to, cause its third party administrators or third party insurance
providers to (x) cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-
at-work or similar requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents to the extent it would have been waived under the comparable Company Employee Plan, and (y) cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under a comparable Company Employee
Plan during the plan year of the Company Employee Plan in which the Closing Date occurs to be given full credit for amounts
paid by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents pursuant to such Parent Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable Parent Plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent Plan.
Any vacation or paid time off that is accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall continue to be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and shall be subject to the terms
of the vacation or paid time off policy of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed
to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
Subsidiaries to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) prevent the amendment, modification, or termination
of any agreement with a Continuing Employee after the Effective Time; or (iii) constitute the establishment or adoption of or
an amendment to any employee benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement or
otherwise be treated as an adoption of, or amendment or modification of, any Employee Plan, Parent Plan or other benefit plan
arrangement. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee, officer, director,
consultant, or other service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and
benefits that may be provided to any officer, director, consultant, or other service provider of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Affiliates or under any benefit plan which any of them may
maintain, or otherwise, except that the Company may enforce these provisions on behalf of any impacted Continuing
Employee.

(d) If directed in writing by Parent at least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company and any ERISA
Affiliate of the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to terminate each
Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a “401(k)
Plan”), with such termination effective as of the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) Plan(s) have been timely terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company
Board and, as

review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Company also
shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such 401(k) Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably request.

(e) In order to ensure or effect compliance of the Company’s Welfare Benefit Plans with the requirements of ERISA, the
Company will take the actions set forth in Section 6.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter within the timeframes set forth
therein.

(f) Parent shall (i) file with the SEC, no later than one Business Day after the Closing Date, a registration statement on

material portion of the Financings contemplated by the Financing Commitments sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitments

aggregate, prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the ability of Parent and
Acquisition Sub to fully perform their respective covenants and obligations under this Agreement.

8.3 Fees and Expenses.

(a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party or parties, as applicable, incurring such expenses whether or not
the Merger is consummated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall pay one-half of the filing
fees and the costs of filings made pursuant to Antitrust Laws and of printing and mailing the Proxy Statement.

(b) Company Payments.

(i) The Company shall pay to Parent $32,300,000 (the “Termination Fee”), within two Business Days after the
satisfaction of the following conditions: (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(i), Section 8.1(b)(iii), or Section 8.1(d) (for Section 8.1(d), only if terminated as a result of a breach by the
Company of its covenants or obligations, and not its representations or warranties, such that the condition set forth in
Section 7.2(b) would not be satisfied); (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to any such
termination of this Agreement, a Competing Acquisition Transaction shall have been publicly announced or shall have

Competing Acquisition Transaction referred to in clause (B) of this Section 8.3(b). For purposes of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 8.3(b)(i) only, a “Competing Acquisition Transaction” shall have the same meaning as an
“Acquisition Transaction” except that all references therein to “15%” shall be deemed to be references to “50%”.

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e), the Company shall pay
to Parent the Termination Fee concurrently with and as a condition to the effectiveness of such termination.

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f), the Company shall pay to
Parent the Termination Fee within two Business Days after such termination.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but subject to Parent’s rights set forth in
Section 9.7, in any circumstance in which Parent receives payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3(b),
the receipt of the Termination Fee in such circumstance shall, except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach of this
Agreement by the Company, constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Acquisition Sub, Parent’s Subsidiaries
and any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees (“Parent Related Parties”) against the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees (collectively, the “Company Related Parties”) for any and
all losses and damages suffered or incurred as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder prior to the date of such termination, and, upon Parent’s
receipt of the Termination Fee in such circumstance, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any other
document, theory of law or equity or oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith,
in contract, in tort or otherwise (except that (x) the Company shall be obligated pursuant those provisions that expressly
survive such termination in accordance with Section 8.2, (y) the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue to survive, and (z) the Company shall also be obligated with respect to Section 8.3(e)). Except as expressly

Termination Fee in such circumstance, and, except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement by the
Company, (A) none of Parent, Acquisition Sub or any Parent Related Party shall be entitled to bring, maintain or support
any Legal Proceedings against the Company or any Company Related Party arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination, and (B) Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause any Legal Proceedings pending in connection with this
Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent
maintained by Parent, Acquisition Sub or any Parent Related Party against the Company or any Company Related Party to
be dismissed with prejudice promptly.

(v) The Company shall make any required payment of the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

(c) Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form of equitable relief, to cause Parent and Acquisition
Sub to consummate the Merger at any time if, and only if, and the Company shall not otherwise be entitled to obtain any
injunction or other form of equitable relief to cause Parent and Acquisition Sub to effectuate the Merger, unless, each of the
following conditions has been satisfied: (A) all conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 (other than those conditions that by
their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) have been
satisfied, and remain satisfied, at the time when the Closing would have occurred, (B) Parent and Acquisition Sub fail to
complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.3 (taking into account any
extension of the Termination Date in accordance with Section 8.1(b)(i)), and (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that
if specific performance is granted, then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.3(c) shall
prohibit the Company from seeking an injunction, specific performance and/or other equitable relief pursuant to Section 9.7
prior to the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 being satisfied or waived.

(d) Single Payment Only. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under
more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events.

(e) Liquidated Damages. Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent, in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable, and which do not involve fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement, for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on
the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision and (iii) without these agreements, the Parent would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3 and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the payment of any amount set forth in
this Section 8.3, the Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on
such amount at the annual rate of two percent plus the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law.

(f) No Recourse. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, (i) agrees that none of the Financing Sources or their respective current, former, or future Affiliates and
Representatives shall have any liability or obligation (whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, or validity hereof or any
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing and the Financing Commitments) (ii) waives any rights
or claims against any of the Financing Sources and their respective current, former, or future Affiliates and Representatives in
any way relating to

Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto, without notice or liability to any
other Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, Persons other than the

of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, such provisions in other jurisdictions will remain
in effect and, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to

remedy.

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal
remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and/or Acquisition Sub,
on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one

provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of such party (or parties) under this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches

EVERCORE OPINION

 

September 17, 2017

The Board of Directors of
Silver Spring Networks, Inc.
230 W. Tasman Drive
San Jose, California 95134

Members of the Board of Directors:

We understand that Silver Spring Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), proposes to enter into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the “Merger Agreement”), with Itron, Inc., a Washington corporation
(“Parent”), and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Acquisition Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things,
(i) Acquisition Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger (the “Merger”); (ii) the
Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; and (iii) each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other than Cancelled Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares,
will be converted into the right to receive $16.25 per share in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and
conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement and terms used herein and not defined shall have the
meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

The Board of Directors has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such Merger Consideration.

In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:

(i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we deemed to
be relevant, including publicly available research analysts’ estimates;

(ii) reviewed certain non-public historical financial statements and other non- public historical financial and operating
data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to us by management of the Company;

(iii) reviewed certain non-public projected financial data relating to the Company under alternative business
assumptions prepared and furnished to us by management of the Company;

(iv) reviewed certain non-public historical and projected operating data relating to the Company prepared and
furnished to us by management of the Company;

(v) discussed the past and current operations, financial projections and current financial condition of the Company
with management of the Company (including their views on the risks and uncertainties of achieving such
projections);

(vi) reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Company Common Stock;

(vii) compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those of certain
other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant;

(viii) compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger with those
of certain other transactions that we deemed relevant;

(ix) reviewed the Merger Agreement; and

(x) performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed appropriate.

Letter to the Board of Directors of
Silver Spring Networks, Inc.
September 17, 2017
Page 2

For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without undertaking any independent verification
of, the accuracy and completeness of all of the information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made
available to, discussed with, or reviewed by us, and we assume no liability therefor. With respect to the projected financial data
relating to the Company referred to above, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and good faith judgments of management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the
Company under the alternative business assumptions reflected therein. We express no view as to any projected financial data
relating to the Company or the assumptions on which they are based.

For purposes of rendering our opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the representations and
warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants
and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the
Merger will be satisfied without material waiver or modification thereof. We have further assumed that all governmental, regulatory
or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any material delay,
limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the consummation of the Merger or materially reduce the
benefits to the holders of the Company Common Stock of the Merger.

We have not made nor assumed any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities
of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such appraisals, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the
Company under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based
upon information made available to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they exist and
as can be evaluated on the date hereof. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not
have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

We have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to the holders
of the Company Common Stock, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration. We do not express any view on, and
our opinion does not address, the fairness of the proposed transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by,
the holders of any other securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of
any compensation (other than the Merger Consideration in respect of Company Common Stock) to be paid or payable to any of the
officers, directors or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Merger Consideration or
otherwise. We have assumed that any modification to the structure of the transaction will not vary in any respect material to our
analysis. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that
might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger.
This letter, and our opinion, does not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors or to any other persons in respect of the
Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of Company Common Stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger. We are
not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and have assumed the accuracy and completeness of assessments by the Company
and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.

We will receive a fee for our services upon the rendering of this opinion. The Company has also agreed to reimburse our
expenses and to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. We will also be entitled to receive a success
fee if the Merger is consummated. Prior to this engagement, we, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates, provided financial
advisory services to the Company and had received fees for the rendering of these services including the reimbursement of
expenses. During the two year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship existed between Evercore Group L.L.C. and
its affiliates and Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Evercore Group L.L.C. or its affiliates as a result of such a
relationship. We may provide financial or other services to the Company or Parent in the future and in connection with any such
services we may receive compensation.

In the ordinary course of business, Evercore Group L.L.C. or its affiliates may actively trade the securities, or related derivative
securities, or financial instruments of the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates, for its own account and for the accounts of
its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or instruments.

connection with their evaluation of the Merger. The issuance of this opinion has been approved by an Opinion Committee of
Evercore Group L.L.C.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such Merger Consideration.
 Very truly yours,

ANNEX C

SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE

§ 262 Appraisal rights

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of
the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by
the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b)
and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the
words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean
a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of
stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the
record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by
more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the
constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the
surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of
merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock
anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in
respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will
be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b.
of this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267
of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of
the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title,
appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including
those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment”
substituted for the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent
corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting corporation.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or
consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth
in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in
accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection
(b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and
shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy
of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the
corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such
stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote
against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do
so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has
complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the
merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation
within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation
who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for
any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of
this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice
may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the
effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the
date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the
consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice,
demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date
of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation
that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting
corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided,
however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a
merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by §
251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each
stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with
this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is
required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the
facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent
corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not

more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given
prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the
notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any
stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal
rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the
value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a
named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the
merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has
complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to
receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate
number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been
received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within
10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or
within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof,
whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock
held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request
from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition
was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting
corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a
duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown
on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the
day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as
the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs
thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares
and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may
dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or
series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities
exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights
unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for
appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1
million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such
proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the
Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5%
over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the
effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case
interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid
and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon
application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding,
the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled
to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such
is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to
appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the
corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of
Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any
stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees
and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided
in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to
the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the
time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a
written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter
with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of
the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this
provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the
merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of
this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the
surviving or resulting corporation.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Voting Agreement, Silver Spring Networks, Inc., a Delaware

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual agreements and covenants set forth herein and in the
Merger Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

agree to the direct or indirect acquisition or sale, pledge, encumbrance, assignment, transfer or other disposition (whether
by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to hedging, cash settlement or otherwise) of any of his or its
Stockholder Shares (any such action in clause (a), (b) or (c) above, a “transfer”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the foregoing sentence, this Section 2.1 shall not prohibit a transfer of Stockholder Shares by Stockholder (i) if
Stockholder is an individual, (A) to any member of Stockholder’s immediate family or to a trust solely for the benefit of
Stockholder or any member of Stockholder’s immediate family, (B) upon the death of Stockholder to Stockholder’s heirs
or (C) to a charitable entity qualified as a 501(c)(3) organization under the Code or (ii) if Stockholder is not a natural
person, to an Affiliate controlled by Stockholder or under common control with Stockholder, as applicable; provided,
however, that in each case a transfer shall be permitted only if, and as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of such
transfer, the transferee agrees in a writing, satisfactory in form and substance to Parent, to be bound by all of the terms of
this Voting Agreement as though such transferee were the “Stockholder” hereunder. Stockholder shall and hereby does
authorize Parent or its counsel to notify the Company’s transfer agent that there is a stop transfer order with respect to all
of the Stockholder Shares (and that this Voting Agreement places limits on the voting and transfer of the Stockholder
Shares); provided that if Parent or its counsel gives such notification, it shall following the Expiration Time (as defined
below) further notify the Company’s transfer agent that the stop transfer order (and all other restrictions contained in this
Voting Agreement) have terminated as of such date.

2.2 Vote in Favor of the Merger and Related Matters. Stockholder, solely in Stockholder’s capacity as a stockholder of the
Company (and not, if applicable, in Stockholder’s capacity as an officer or director of the Company), irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that, from and after the date hereof and until the Expiration Time (as defined below), at any
meeting of the stockholders of the Company or any adjournment thereof, or in connection with any action by written
consent of the stockholders of the Company, Stockholder shall:

(a) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause all of his or its Stockholder Shares to be counted as present thereat
for purposes of calculating a quorum; and

(b) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or deliver a written consent (or cause a consent to be delivered)
covering, all of his or its Stockholder Shares: (i) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) in favor of any proposal to adjourn
or postpone any meeting of the Company’s stockholders to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the
Merger Agreement, (ii) in favor of any other matter reasonably relating to the consummation or facilitation of, or
otherwise in furtherance of, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (iii)
against any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction and (iv) against any other action, proposal, agreement,
transaction or arrangement submitted for approval of the Company’s stockholders that is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere or be inconsistent with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect
the consummation of the Merger, including, without limitation, any extraordinary transaction, merger, consolidation,
sale of assets, recapitalization or other business combination involving the Company or any other action, agreement
or arrangement that could reasonably be expected to result in a material breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company under the Merger Agreement or that could reasonably
be expected to result in any of the conditions to the obligations under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled or
satisfied.

2.3 Termination. This Voting Agreement and the obligations of the parties hereunder shall automatically terminate upon the
earliest to occur of (a) such time as the Merger Agreement shall have been validly terminated pursuant to its terms, (b) the
Effective Time, (c) the Termination Date and (d) such time as the Merger Agreement is amended to change the form or
reduce the amount of Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant thereto (such earliest time, the “Expiration Time”);
provided, however, that the provisions of Article V shall survive any termination of this Voting Agreement.

3.1 Authorization; Binding Agreement. Stockholder has all legal right, power, authority and capacity to execute and deliver
this Voting Agreement, to perform his, her or its obligations hereunder, and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Voting Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by or on behalf of Stockholder and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Voting Agreement by Parent, constitutes a legal, valid and

Voting Agreement will not, except where it would not interfere with Stockholder’s ability to perform Stockholder’s
obligations hereunder (i) conflict with or violate any Law by which Stockholder is bound or affected, (ii) violate or
conflict with the articles of incorporation or bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents of Stockholder, if
applicable, or (iii) result in or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) any breach of or default
under, or give to another party any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of any lien or encumbrance on any of the property or assets of Stockholder pursuant to, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which
Stockholder is a party or by which Stockholder or any of Stockholder’s properties or assets is bound or affected.
There is no beneficiary or holder of a voting trust certificate or other interest of any trust of which Stockholder is a
trustee whose consent is required for the execution and delivery of this Voting Agreement or the consummation by
Stockholder of the transactions contemplated by this Voting Agreement.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Voting Agreement to Parent by Stockholder does not, and the performance of this
Voting Agreement will not, require any consent, approval, authorization, waiver, order or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any third party or any Governmental Authority, except where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations, waivers, orders or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not interfere with
Stockholder’s ability to perform Stockholder’s obligations hereunder.

3.3 Title to Stockholder Shares. Stockholder is the record or beneficial owner of the shares of Company Capital Stock set forth
opposite its name on Exhibit A. Stockholder has good title to the Stockholder Shares free and clear of all Liens other than

the Closing Date, sole voting power (including the right to control such vote as contemplated herein), sole power of
disposition and sole power to agree to all of the matters set forth in this Voting Agreement, in each case with respect to all
of his or its Stockholder Shares.

contemplated by the Merger Agreement, to the extent the information contained therein is consistent with other
disclosures being made by the Company and Parent).

to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or the personnel, of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to, or take any other action regarding, any inquiry, expression of interest,
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (other than,
solely in response to an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring Person to this Section 4.6 and to limit its
conversation or other communication exclusively to such referral).

or understanding herein in any capacity other than in Stockholder’s capacity as a record holder and beneficial owner
of the Stockholder Shares, and not in Stockholder’s capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of the
Company’s Subsidiaries, and (ii) nothing herein will be construed to limit or affect any action or inaction by
Stockholder or any representative of Stockholder, as applicable, serving on the board of directors of the Company or

assignment contrary to the provisions of this Section 5.2 shall be null and void.

5.3 Severability. The provisions of this Voting Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of
any provision hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this
Voting Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable
and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent
and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision; and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of

performance of such covenant or obligation, with Stockholder agreeing that it shall waive the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at law in any such Legal Proceeding, and/or (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.

similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 5.4, and
Stockholder irrevocably waives any right he, she or it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument. Stockholder shall not be liable for any money damages for any breach of this Voting
Agreement that is not a Willful Breach.

this Voting Agreement or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Voting Agreement shall be governed by, and

otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Voting Agreement or the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Voting Agreement shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and the parties
hereto irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such court (and, in the case of appeals, the appropriate appellate court
therefrom), in any such Legal Proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any such Legal Proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as
provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. The
parties hereto agree that service of any court paper may be made in

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS VOTING AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND

AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS

waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege. Neither party shall be deemed to have waived any claim available to it arising out of
this Voting Agreement, or any right, power or privilege hereunder, unless the waiver is expressly set forth in writing duly
executed and delivered on behalf of such party. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
