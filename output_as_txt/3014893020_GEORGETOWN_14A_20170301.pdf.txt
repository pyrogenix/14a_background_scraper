MERGER PROPOSED — YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

 
Dear Fellow Stockholder:
 

We cordially invite you to attend a special meeting of stockholders of Georgetown Bancorp, Inc. (“Georgetown Bancorp”). The special meeting will be held at the headquarters of
Georgetown Bancorp located at 2 East Main Street, Georgetown, Massachusetts 01833, on February 13, 2017, at 4:00 p.m., local time.
 

On October 5, 2016, Georgetown Bancorp entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Salem Five Bancorp and Bright Star, Inc., a newly formed subsidiary of Salem
Five Bancorp, pursuant to which Bright Star, Inc. will merge with and into Georgetown Bancorp, with Georgetown Bancorp as the surviving corporation. If the merger is completed, at the
closing your shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock will be converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash for each share. Upon completion of the merger, you will no longer
own any stock or have any other interest in Georgetown Bancorp.
 

At the special meeting, you will be asked to approve: (i) the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 5, 2016, by and among Salem Five Bancorp, Bright Star, Inc. and
Georgetown Bancorp (the “Merger Agreement”), and the merger; (ii) a non-binding advisory proposal regarding the compensation to be paid to the named executive officers of
Georgetown Bancorp in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements”); and (iii) any
adjournment or postponement of the special meeting, if deemed necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes represented in person or by
proxy at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement and the merger. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of shares of Georgetown
Bancorp common stock outstanding must be voted for approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger for the merger to be completed. If the Merger Agreement and the merger are so
approved, and all other conditions described in the Merger Agreement have been met or waived, the merger is expected to close during the first quarter of 2017.
 

Your exchange of shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock for cash generally will cause you to recognize income or loss for federal, and possibly state, local and foreign,
income tax purposes. You should consult your personal tax advisor for a full understanding of the income tax consequences of the merger to you.
 

Your Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger, the Merger-Related Executive
Compensation Arrangements proposal and the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary, in order to solicit additional proxies to approve the Merger Agreement and the
merger, because your Board believes that the merger is advisable and in the best interests of Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders.
 

This proxy statement provides you with detailed information about the proposed merger and includes, as Appendix A, a copy of the Merger Agreement. We urge you to read the
enclosed materials carefully for a complete description of the merger.
 

Your vote is important. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please complete, date and sign the enclosed proxy card and return it promptly in the postage-paid
envelope we have provided. You may also vote your shares by telephone or the Internet following the instructions on the enclosed proxy or voting instruction card. If your shares are held
in an account at a bank, broker or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, broker or nominee how to vote your shares using the separate voting instruction form furnished by your
bank, broker or nominee. Failing to vote will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement and the merger.
 

If you have any questions concerning the merger or need assistance in voting, please contact Georgetown Bancorp’s proxy solicitor, Laurel Hill Advisory Group, LLC.  Banks and
brokers can call (516) 933-3100, and all others can call, toll-free, (888) 742-1305.
 

On behalf of the Board, we thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter.
 
   

Sincerely,
 

     
 

/s/ J. Richard Murphy

Notice is hereby given that a special meeting of stockholders of Georgetown Bancorp, Inc. (“Georgetown Bancorp”) will be held at the headquarters of Georgetown Bancorp
located at 2 East Main Street, Georgetown, Massachusetts 01833, on February 13, 2017, commencing at 4:00 p.m., local time, and thereafter as it may from time to time be adjourned.
 

A proxy card and a proxy statement for the special meeting are enclosed. The meeting is being held for the following purposes:
 

1.                                      To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 5, 2016, by and among Salem Five Bancorp, Bright Star, Inc.
and Georgetown Bancorp, Inc., pursuant to which Bright Star, Inc. will merge with and into Georgetown Bancorp, with Georgetown Bancorp as the surviving
corporation, as well as the merger, as more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement;

 
2.                                      To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation to be paid to the named executive officers of Georgetown Bancorp

in connection with the merger if the merger is consummated (the “Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements”);
 

3.                                      To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting of stockholders if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies; and
 

4.                                      To transact such other business as properly may come before the meeting and any adjournment or adjournments thereof.
 
We are not aware of any other business to come before the special meeting. Any action may be taken on Proposals No. 1 and No. 2 at the special meeting or on any date or dates to which
the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed. You can vote at the special meeting if you owned Georgetown Bancorp common stock at the close of business on December 27, 2016.
 



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1542299/000110465917000182/a16-21651_1defm14a.htm

Your vote is very important. We cannot complete the merger unless stockholders of Georgetown Bancorp holding a majority of the total number of shares of Georgetown
Bancorp common stock outstanding approve the Merger Agreement and the merger. Failure to vote will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement and the
merger.
 

Regardless of whether you plan to attend the special meeting, please vote as soon as possible. If you hold stock in your name as a stockholder of record, please complete,
sign, date and return the accompanying proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope, or call the toll-free telephone number or use the Internet by following the
instructions included with your proxy card or voting instruction card. If you hold your stock in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, please direct your
bank, broker or other nominee to vote in accordance with the instructions you have received from your bank, broker or other nominee. This will not prevent you from voting in
person, but it will help to secure a quorum and avoid added solicitation costs. Any record holder of Georgetown Bancorp common stock who is present at the special meeting may vote in
person instead of by proxy, thereby canceling any previous proxy. In any event, a proxy may be revoked as more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement at any time before it
is voted.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
ABOUT VOTING PROCEDURES FOR THE SPECIAL MEETING

 
Q:                      Why am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card?
 
A:                       You are being asked to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 5, 2016 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Salem Five Bancorp, Bright Star, Inc.

and Georgetown Bancorp, Inc. (“Georgetown Bancorp”), as well as the merger between Georgetown Bancorp and Bright Star, Inc. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to
this proxy statement as Appendix A. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Bright Star, Inc., which has been formed as a subsidiary of Salem Five Bancorp
to facilitate the merger, will merge with and into Georgetown Bancorp, with Georgetown Bancorp as the surviving corporation.  Georgetown Bancorp will be dissolved and
liquidated into Salem Five Bancorp.  In addition, Georgetown Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Georgetown Bancorp, will merge with and into Salem Five Cents Savings
Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Salem Five Bancorp, with Salem Five Cents Savings Bank as the surviving bank.  Each outstanding common share of Georgetown Bancorp
will be converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash at closing. As a result of the merger, Georgetown Bancorp and Georgetown Bank will no longer exist as separate legal
entities, and Georgetown Bancorp’s common stock will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

 
Additionally, you are being asked to vote on a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain payments that may be made to Georgetown Bancorp’s named executive officers in
connection with the merger, if consummated.

 
You are also being asked to approve the adjournment of the special meeting of stockholders if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies.

 
Q:                      What do I need to do now?
 
A:                       After you have carefully read this proxy statement, including the appendices, and have decided how you wish to vote your shares, please vote your shares promptly so that your

shares are represented and voted at the special meeting.
 

If you hold stock in your name as a stockholder of record, indicate on your proxy card how you want your shares to be voted or, if you prefer, you can vote by using the telephone
or Internet. If you choose not to vote by telephone or Internet, then sign, date and mail your proxy card in the enclosed prepaid return envelope as soon as possible. This will enable
your shares to be represented and voted at the special meeting.

 
If you hold your stock in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must direct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote in accordance with the instructions you
have received from your bank, broker or other nominee. “Street name” stockholders who wish to vote at the special meeting will need to obtain a proxy form from the institution
that holds their shares.

 
If you are a participant in the Georgetown Savings Bank SBERA 401(k) Plan (“401(k) Plan”) or the Georgetown Savings Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”), you
will have received voting instruction forms that reflect all shares for which you may direct the voting under these plans. Under the terms of these plans, in connection with the
change in control, the trustee or administrator votes all shares held by the plan, but each participant may provide instructions to the trustee or administrator how to vote the shares of
Georgetown Bancorp common stock allocated to his or her plan account (with respect to the 401(k) Plan, you will only be asked to vote on the merger). The ESOP trustee will vote
your shares in accordance with your instructions and will vote the unallocated shares in the same proportion as the instructions received from participants.  The 401(k) Plan
administrator will vote all shares in the 401(k) Plan “FOR” or “AGAINST” the merger in the same manner that reflects the majority of voting instructions received.  The deadline
for returning your voting instructions is February 6, 2017.

 
Q:                      What is the vote required to approve the Merger Agreement?
 
A:                       Approval of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of shares of Georgetown Bancorp

common stock outstanding as of the close of business on December 27, 2016, the record date for the special meeting. Failing to vote will have the same effect as voting
“AGAINST” the Merger Agreement and the merger.

 
Q:                      Why are Georgetown Bancorp stockholders being asked to approve, on a non-binding basis, the Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements?
 
A:                       Securities and Exchange Commission rules require Georgetown Bancorp to hold a non-binding vote with respect to certain payments that may be made to Georgetown Bancorp’s

named executive officers in connection with the merger, if consummated.
 
Q:                      What will happen if Georgetown Bancorp Stockholders do not approve the Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements proposal at the special meeting?
 
A:                       Approval of the Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements pursuant to which certain Georgetown Bancorp named executive officers may receive compensation in

connection with the merger, if consummated, is not a condition to the completion of the merger. The vote with respect to the Merger-Related Executive Compensation
Arrangements is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Georgetown Bancorp. Therefore, if the Merger Agreement and the merger are approved by Georgetown Bancorp’s
stockholders and the merger is consummated, the compensation may still be paid pursuant to the Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements to the Georgetown
Bancorp named executive officers if and to the extent required or allowed under applicable law, even if this proposal is not approved.

 
Q:                       Why is my vote important?
 
A:                     If you do not return your proxy card or vote by telephone, Internet or in person at the special meeting or fail to instruct your bank, broker or nominee how to vote, it will be more

difficult for us to obtain the necessary quorum to hold our special meeting. In addition, your failure to vote or failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger. The Merger Agreement and the merger must be approved by the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the total number of shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock outstanding. The Georgetown Bancorp Board of Directors unanimously
recommends that you vote to approve the Merger Agreement.

 
Q:                      If my broker holds my shares in street name, will my broker automatically vote my shares for me?
 
A:                       No. Your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions from you. You should instruct your broker to vote your shares, following the procedures your broker

provides to you.
 
Q:                      What if I abstain from voting or fail to instruct my broker?
 
A:                       If you abstain from voting or fail to instruct your broker to vote your shares, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement and the merger.  However,

abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted toward a quorum at the special meeting.
 
Q:                      Can I attend the special meeting and vote my shares in person?
 
A:                       Yes. All stockholders are invited to attend the special meeting. Stockholders of record can vote in person at the special meeting. If your shares are held in street name, then you are

not the stockholder of record and you must ask your bank, broker or other nominee how you can vote at the special meeting.
 
Q:                      Can I change my vote?
 
A:                       Yes, you can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting. If you have not voted through your bank, broker or other nominee, there are five ways

you can change your vote after you have sent in your proxy card or after you have voted by telephone or Internet.
 

·      First, you may send a written notice to our Corporate Secretary, stating that you would like to revoke your proxy.
 

·      Second, you may complete and submit a new proxy card. Any earlier proxies will be revoked automatically.
 

ii

Table of Contents
 

·      Third, you may attend the special meeting and vote in person. Any earlier-dated proxy will be revoked. However, simply attending the special meeting without voting will not
revoke your proxy.

 
·      Fourth, you can change your vote at the Internet address shown on your proxy card. The Internet voting system is available 24 hours a day until 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on

February 13, 2017.
 

·      Fifth, you can change your vote by using the toll-free telephone number shown on your proxy card. The telephone voting system is available 24 hours a day in the United States
until 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 13, 2017.

 
If you have directed your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares, you must follow directions you receive from your bank, broker or nominee to change your vote.

 
Q:                    Will I have the right to have my shares appraised if I dissent from the merger?
 
A:                     No.  Under Georgetown Bancorp’s Articles of Incorporation, Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders are not entitled to exercise any rights of an objecting stockholder provided under

Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the Maryland General Corporation Law, unless the Board of Directors determines that such rights apply with respect to a transaction. The Board of Directors of
Georgetown Bancorp has not made such a determination with respect to the merger. Accordingly, the stockholders of Georgetown Bancorp do not have appraisal rights with respect
to the Merger.

 
Q:                      Should I send in my stock certificates now?

equal to the difference between the amount of cash you receive in the merger and the adjusted tax basis of your shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock. See “Proposal I—
Approval of the Merger Agreement—Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders.” You are urged to consult your own tax advisor to determine the particular tax

GEORGETOWN BANCORP
PROXY STATEMENT FOR SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

SUMMARY TERM SHEET
 

This is a summary of selected key terms of the transaction between Georgetown Bancorp, Inc. (“Georgetown Bancorp”) and Salem Five Bancorp. It may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. We urge you to read carefully the entire document, including the appendices, and the other documents to which we refer, including the Merger
Agreement, to fully understand the merger. Each item in this summary refers to the page of this document on which the subject is discussed in more detail.
 
In the Merger, Georgetown Bancorp Stockholders Will Have a Right to Receive $26.00 Per Share of Georgetown Bancorp Common Stock (page 42)
 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Georgetown Bancorp will merge with and into Salem Five Bancorp. This will be accomplished through the transactions set forth under the
caption “Proposal I—Approval of the Merger Agreement—Terms of the Merger Agreement.” If the merger occurs, each stockholder of Georgetown Bancorp will receive, for each share
owned, the right to receive $26.00 in cash at closing. See the discussion under the caption “Proposal I—Approval of the Merger Agreement—Terms of The Merger Agreement” for more
information.
 
Georgetown Bancorp’s Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Board of Directors that Georgetown Bancorp Stockholders Vote “FOR” Approval of the Merger
Agreement (page 18)
 

The merger cannot occur unless Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders approve the Merger Agreement and the merger by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
total number of shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock outstanding, all regulatory and other approvals necessary to complete the merger are obtained and other conditions to the
merger are satisfied or waived. See the discussion under the caption “Proposal I—Approval of the Merger Agreement—Conditions to Complete the Merger” for more information. The
Board of Directors of Georgetown Bancorp has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the merger and unanimously recommends that Georgetown Bancorp’s
stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement and the merger. In reaching its decision, the Georgetown Bancorp Board of Directors considered a number of factors, which are
described in the section captioned “Proposal I—Approval of the Merger Agreement—Georgetown Bancorp’s Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Board of Directors that
Georgetown Bancorp Stockholders Vote “FOR” Approval of the Merger Agreement.” Because of the wide variety of factors considered, the Georgetown Bancorp Board of Directors did
not believe it practicable, nor did it attempt, to quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision.
 

The Georgetown Bancorp Board of Directors also unanimously recommends that the Georgetown Bancorp stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the non-binding, advisory
proposal regarding the Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements and “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit
further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement.
 
Georgetown Bancorp’s Financial Advisor Has Provided an Opinion to the Georgetown Bancorp Board of Directors Regarding the Merger Consideration (page 21 and
Appendix B)
 

In connection with the merger, Georgetown Bancorp’s financial advisor, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (“KBW”), delivered a written opinion, dated October 5, 2016, to the
Georgetown Bancorp Board of Directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to the holders of Georgetown Bancorp common stock of the
merger consideration in the proposed merger.  The full text of the opinion, which describes the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and
limitations on the review undertaken by KBW in preparing the opinion, is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement. The opinion was directed to the Georgetown Bancorp Board of
Directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the merger. The opinion did not address the underlying business decision of Georgetown
Bancorp to engage in the merger or enter into the Merger Agreement or constitute a recommendation to the Georgetown Bancorp Board of Directors in connection with the merger, and it
does not constitute a recommendation

to any holder of Georgetown Bancorp common stock or any stockholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with the merger or any other matter.
 
Georgetown Bancorp has Agreed to Pay Salem Five Bancorp a Termination Fee of $2.0 Million in Certain Circumstances and Has Agreed to Non-Solicitation Restrictions
(pages 49 and 52)
 

Under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement, in connection with a termination of the Merger Agreement, Georgetown Bancorp is required to pay Salem Five
Bancorp a $2.0 million termination fee. See the discussion under the caption “Proposal I—Approval of the Merger Agreement—Termination Fee” for more information.
 

In general, Georgetown Bancorp has agreed that it will not seek or encourage a competing transaction to acquire Georgetown Bancorp except in very limited situations in which
an unsolicited offer is made. See the discussion under the caption “Proposal I—Approval of the Merger Agreement—Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers” for more information.
 
Georgetown Bancorp’s Executive Officers and Directors Have Financial Interests in the Merger That Differ From Your Interests (page 36)
 

In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Georgetown Bancorp to approve the Merger Agreement and the merger, you should be aware that executive
officers and directors of Georgetown Bancorp and Georgetown Bank have employment and other compensation agreements or plans that give them interests in the merger that are
somewhat different from, or in addition to, your interests as Georgetown Bancorp stockholders.  These interests and agreements, include:
 

·                                          cash payments to Georgetown Bank’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert E. Balletto, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Frederick H.
Weismann, and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Joseph W. Kennedy, under their employment agreements, change in control agreements and
supplemental executive retirement plans, as applicable;

 
·                                          new employment agreements for Messrs. Balletto and Kennedy;

·                                          the accelerated vesting of outstanding restricted stock awards previously granted by Georgetown Bancorp, which will be exchanged for the merger consideration;

 
·                                          the accelerated vesting of outstanding stock options previously granted by Georgetown Bancorp, which can be exchanged for cash payments equal to the difference

between the option exercise price and $26.00;
 

·                                          additional allocations under Georgetown Bank’s ESOP of a pro-rata portion of the excess assets in the plan’s suspense account after the ESOP loan is repaid, the ESOP
is terminated and the shares in the ESOP are exchanged for the merger consideration; and

 
·                                          the rights of officers and directors of Georgetown Bancorp and its subsidiaries to continued indemnification coverage and continued coverage under directors’ and

officers’ liability insurance policies.

Approval of the Non-Binding Proposal Regarding the Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements Requires the Affirmative Vote of a Majority of the Votes Cast at
the Special Meeting (page 56)
 

Approval by the Georgetown Bancorp stockholders of the non-binding proposal regarding the Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements is determined by a
majority of the votes cast at the special meeting, without regard to broker non-votes or proxies marked “abstain.” It is an advisory vote and is not binding on Georgetown Bancorp,
Georgetown Bancorp’s Board of Directors, or Salem Five Bancorp. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder
approval. Regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote, if the merger is consummated, Georgetown Bancorp’s named executive officers will be eligible to receive the
various payments and benefits in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those arrangements, subject to any regulatory limitations.
 
What Holders of Georgetown Bancorp Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards Will Receive (page 42)
 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding stock option granted by Georgetown Bancorp under its 2009 Equity Incentive Plan or 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, whether
vested or unvested, with an exercise price that is less than $26.00 that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger will be canceled and converted automatically into
the right to receive a cash payment equal to the stock option consideration as described further under the caption “Proposal I—Approval of the Merger Agreement—Treatment of
Georgetown Bancorp Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.”
 

Each outstanding restricted stock awarded granted by Georgetown Bancorp under its 2009 Equity Incentive Plan or 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, whether vested or unvested, that
is outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger will be canceled, in exchange for a cash payment equal to the number of shares subject to the restricted stock,
multiplied by $26.00.
 

At the effective time of the merger, each share of common stock held by the ESOP and the 401(k) Plan will be converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash at closing.
 
There are Conditions That Must Be Satisfied or Waived for the Merger to Occur (page 50)
 

Currently, we expect to complete the merger during the first quarter of 2017. As more fully described in this proxy statement and in the Merger Agreement, the completion of the
merger depends on a number of conditions being satisfied or, where legally permissible, waived. These conditions include, among others:
 

·                                          the approval of the Merger Agreement by Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders;
 

·                                          the absence of (a) any order, injunction or decree by any court or agency of competent jurisdiction or (b) any statute, rule, regulation, order, injunction or decree enacted,
entered, promulgated or enforced by any governmental entity, that prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

 
·                                          the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the expiration or termination of all related statutory waiting periods, subject to the absence of any term or condition that

would be, individually or in the aggregate, materially burdensome to Salem Five Bancorp;
 

·                                          the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties in the Merger Agreement as of the closing date of the merger, subject to the materiality standards
provided in the Merger Agreement, and the performance of the parties in all material respects of all obligations required to be performed by each of them at or prior to
the effective time of the merger under the Merger Agreement (and the receipt by each party of certificates from the other party to such effect); and

Table of Contents
 

·                                          the satisfaction of all conditions to the consummation of the merger of Georgetown Bank and Salem Five Cents Savings Bank and the reasonable satisfaction of Salem
Five Bancorp that this bank merger can occur immediately after the merger or at some other time thereafter as Salem Five Bancorp may choose.

 
We cannot be certain when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived, or that the merger will be completed.

 
There are Regulatory Approvals That Must Be Received for the Merger to Occur (page 41)
 

Georgetown Bancorp and Salem Five Bancorp each have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and governmental entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, which includes the approval of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), the Massachusetts Board of Bank
Incorporation and the Massachusetts Division of Banks.  Salem Five Bancorp and Salem Five Cents Savings Bank have filed all of the required regulatory applications, but have not yet
received any approvals from these regulators.  Although we do not know of any reason why the regulatory approvals cannot be obtained timely, we cannot be certain when or if such
approvals will be obtained.
 
The Merger Will Be Taxable to Georgetown Bancorp Stockholders for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes (page 33)
 

The receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes (and may be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and foreign income or other tax laws). For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each Georgetown Bancorp



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1542299/000110465917000182/a16-21651_1defm14a.htm

stockholder generally will recognize gain or loss at the effective time of the merger equal to the per share difference, if any, between: (1) $26.00 and (2) the stockholder’s adjusted tax
basis in each share of Georgetown Bancorp common stock exchanged in the merger. The federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of Georgetown
Bancorp common stock. Your tax consequences will depend on your individual situation. Accordingly, we strongly urge you to consult your tax advisor for a full understanding of the
particular tax consequences of the merger to you.

Eastern Time, on February 13, 2017. Once you use the telephone voting system, a series of prompts will tell you how to record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions.

in person if you attend the special meeting.

 
Alternatively, you may attend the special meeting and vote in person. If you are a stockholder whose shares are not registered in your own name, you will need an

assignment of voting rights or a proxy from the stockholder of record to vote personally at the special meeting.

Record Date; Vote Required
 

Only our stockholders of record at the close of business on December 27, 2016 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting or any adjournment thereof. As of
December 27, 2016, there were 1,840,920 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting or any adjournment thereof.
 

At the special meeting our stockholders will be entitled to cast one vote per share of common stock owned on December 27, 2016. Such vote may be exercised in person or by
properly executed proxy. The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote is necessary to
constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be treated as shares present at the special meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
 

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock outstanding is required to approve the Merger Agreement
and the merger. As a result, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger. Approval of the
Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting. Broker non-votes and abstentions from
voting will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements. In order to adjourn the special meeting, a majority of the votes cast at
the special meeting must be voted in favor of the proposal. Broker non-votes and abstentions from voting will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the adjournment.
 

If your shares are held in “street name” by your bank, broker or other nominee you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares using the
instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you have not received these voting instructions or require further information regarding these voting instructions, please
contact your bank, broker or other nominee and he or she can give you directions on how to vote your shares. Brokers who hold shares in “street name” for customers may not exercise
their voting discretion with respect to the approval of non-routine matters such as the merger proposal and thus, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares,
brokers are not empowered to vote the shares with respect to the approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger (i.e., “broker non-votes”). Shares of Georgetown Bancorp common
stock held by persons attending the special meeting but not voting, or shares for which we have received proxies with respect to which holders have abstained from voting, will be
considered abstentions. Abstentions and properly executed broker non-votes, if any, will be treated as shares that are present and entitled to vote at the special meeting for purposes of
determining whether a quorum exists but will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger.
 

Approval of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders is a condition to completion of the merger. See “Proposal I—Approval of the Merger Agreement—Conditions to
Complete the Merger.”
 
Beneficial Ownership of Georgetown Bancorp Common Stock
 

As of December 27, 2016, our directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate 205,408 shares of our common stock, excluding stock
options, or 11.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock.

Shares of our common stock represented by properly executed proxies received prior to or at the special meeting will, unless such proxies have been revoked, be voted at the
special meeting and any adjournments or postponements thereof in accordance with the instructions indicated in the proxies. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed and
dated proxy, the shares will be voted “FOR” the approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger, “FOR” the non-binding proposal to approve the Merger-Related Executive
Compensation Arrangements and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. However, no proxy voted “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the merger will be voted in
favor of an adjournment or postponement to solicit additional votes in favor of the Merger Agreement and the merger.

As soon as possible after the conditions to consummation of the merger described below have been satisfied or waived, and unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated as

other small financial institutions, Georgetown Bancorp has experienced increasing costs for technology and regulatory compliance. The Board of Directors and management have
considered both internal growth strategies and strategic business combinations as means of achieving economies of scale.

On May 5, 2015, Georgetown Bancorp’s President and Chief Executive Officer Robert E. Balletto and Chairman of the Board J. Richard Murphy met with the President and
Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of a Boston-based financial institution (“Company A”), at the request of Company A.  The parties
discussed various items, including the consolidating banking industry in general.  Messrs. Balletto and Murphy reported the results of this discussion to Georgetown Bancorp’s full Board
of Directors.

Table of Contents
 
On July 16, 2015, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Company A called Mr. Balletto, and indicated that, when the time was appropriate for Georgetown

Bancorp, Company A would be interested in having more detailed discussions regarding a possible strategic partnership between the two companies.  Mr. Balletto relayed this expression
of interest to the full Board of Directors.
 

On August 13, 2015, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Company A called Mr. Murphy, and expressed an interest in continuing dialogue regarding a possible strategic
partnership between the two companies.  Mr. Murphy relayed this expression of interest to the full Board of Directors.
 

On August 25, 2015, President and Chief Executive Officer Balletto and Chairman of the Board Murphy met with the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer of a financial institution with operations in Massachusetts and Rhode Island (“Company B”), at the request of Company B.  The parties discussed general matters,
including operating in the current banking environment.  Messrs. Balletto and Murphy reported the results of this discussion to the full Board of Directors.
 

On April 14, 2016, at a special board meeting, Georgetown Bancorp’s Board of Directors met as part of the Board’s ongoing assessment of Georgetown Bancorp’s strategic
opportunities and challenges. Representatives of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. (“KBW”) attended this meeting. KBW is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with
substantial experience advising financial institutions, including with respect to mergers and acquisitions. In addition, KBW had previously served as financial advisor to Georgetown
Bancorp in its “second-step” conversion and related stock offering that was completed in 2012. At this meeting, KBW discussed with the Board a general outlook for the economy, and
reviewed the banking industry in general.  KBW also compared Georgetown Bancorp’s operating results to those of certain other publicly traded regional and national financial
institutions. The Board also discussed both the mergers and acquisitions environment as well as 14 financial institutions with assets greater than $700 million that could be considered
potential acquirors of Georgetown Bancorp, including their financial ability to acquire Georgetown Bancorp at hypothetical prices. These institutions had a presence in the Boston,
Massachusetts market area and appeared to have the resources to pursue a potential business combination with Georgetown Bancorp and the ability to execute and complete a transaction. 
The list of 14 institutions included Salem Five Bancorp, Company A and Company B.
 

At this special board meeting, the Board of Directors also discussed preliminary operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  The Board of Directors discussed that
revenues had been negatively affected by Georgetown Bancorp’s enhancing its regulatory compliance staff and compliance programs, and the expectation that net income for the year
ending December 31, 2016 would be significantly lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2015.
 

On April 27, 2016, President and Chief Executive Officer Balletto and Chairman of the Board Murphy again met with the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer of Company B, at the request of Company B.  The parties discussed general matters, including current trends in the banking industry.  The parties agreed to remain in
contact.  Messrs. Balletto and Murphy reported the results of this discussion to the full Board of Directors.
 

On May 4, 2016, at a special board meeting, the Board of Directors met to consider whether the Board should initiate a process for the potential sale of Georgetown Bancorp. 
Representatives of KBW attended this meeting. The Board again reviewed the 14 institutions considered at the April 14, 2016 meeting.  The Board also considered expected costs that
would be incurred in connection with a merger transaction, such as payments to terminate contracts with service providers and payments due under management change in control
agreements, and how these costs would affect pricing in a merger transaction.  The Board reviewed with legal counsel the Board’s fiduciary duties in connection with different types of
merger transactions.  The Board and KBW then discussed the engagement of KBW to render financial advisory and investment banking services to Georgetown Bancorp in connection
with a possible sale of Georgetown Bancorp.  KBW also reviewed with the Board the merger and acquisition process.  At the end of this meeting, the Board of Directors authorized
Chairman Murphy, Vice Chairman Mary L. Williams and President and Chief Executive Officer Balletto to negotiate the terms of KBW’s engagement.

On May 17, 2016, at a special board meeting, the Board of Directors reviewed the proposed engagement of KBW, which had been negotiated with KBW with the assistance of
legal counsel.  Legal counsel again reviewed the Board’s fiduciary duties.  The Board of Directors unanimously agreed to authorize management to engage KBW.  The Board also
discussed the establishment of a special committee to assist the Board of Directors in its decision-making process in connection with the merger process.  The Board of Directors would
retain all decision-making authority.  Committee members would be identified by the Chairman of the Board, subject to Board approval.  Following this meeting, on May 20, 2016, KBW
was engaged to act as Georgetown Bancorp’s financial advisor in connection with the possible sale of Georgetown Bancorp.
 

At a meeting of the special committee on June 1, 2016 that was attended by representatives of KBW, the special committee reviewed 14 financial institutions that the Board of
Directors could consider as potential purchasers of Georgetown Bancorp.  These were the same 14 financial institutions considered at the April 14 and May 6 board meetings.  The special
committee discussed splitting the companies into two groups:  the primary group consisted of eight companies, including Company A and Company B, that were perceived to have the
greatest potential interest in a transaction with Georgetown Bancorp and the experience and financial ability to compete aggressively in the process.  These companies would be contacted
initially to determine an interest in acquiring Georgetown Bancorp.  The secondary group, consisting of six companies, including Salem Five Bancorp, that were perceived to be less
interested or less capable of completing a transaction, or both, would be contacted in the event that initial contacts with the other eight companies did not yield satisfactory results.  After
further discussion, a seventh company was added to the secondary list.  The special committee also reviewed how the process would be conducted and a potential timeline of events.
 

On June 14, 2016, at a special board meeting, the Board of Directors ratified the selection of Chairman Murphy, Vice Chairman Williams and directors Stephen L. Flynn and
David A. Splaine as the members of the special committee, and confirmed that the committee would facilitate the review of information but would not make decisions without the
approval of the full Board.  The Board then discussed the 15 companies that were considered potential merger partners for Georgetown Bancorp, and divided those companies into two
groups in a manner similar to that discussed by the special committee.  The Board of Directors authorized KBW to begin contacting the eight companies that constituted the primary
group.  The Board of Directors also discussed how the process would be conducted.
 

At Georgetown Bancorp’s direction, between June 20, 2016 and June 24, 2016, KBW contacted nine financial institution holding companies to determine their level of interest in
a possible business combination with Georgetown Bancorp.  The financial institution holding companies contacted included all eight entities initially perceived to have the greatest
potential interest in a transaction with Georgetown Bancorp and the experience and financial ability to compete aggressively in the process, and one additional financial institution holding
company that was previously included on the secondary list, but had contacted KBW to express an interest in acquiring Georgetown Bancorp if it were interested in pursuing a business
combination.
 

Eight of the nine parties, including Company A and Company B, indicated a preliminary interest and were sent customary non-disclosure agreements that identified Georgetown
Bancorp as the target financial institution. Georgetown Bancorp, with the assistance of counsel, negotiated and executed non-disclosure agreements with seven of these potential merger
parties. On June 27, 2016, a virtual data room containing a confidential information memorandum and additional information about Georgetown Bancorp was opened and access was
granted to each of these seven parties after they executed non-disclosure agreements. Parties were initially given until July 29, 2016 to submit non-binding indications of interest.

On June 27, 2016, Salem Five Bancorp’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Ping Yin Chai, called President and Chief Executive Officer Balletto.  Following a general
discussion, Mr. Chai expressed an interest in discussing a potential merger transaction with Georgetown Bancorp.  Mr. Balletto referred Mr. Chai to representatives of KBW.  KBW
provided Salem Five Bancorp with a non-disclosure agreement, which Salem Five Bancorp executed on June 30, 2016.  Salem Five Bancorp was granted access to the virtual data room,
including the confidential information memorandum, on June 30, 2016.

be added to the board of directors of one of Company C’s subsidiary banks.  Company C’s indication of interest also required Georgetown Bancorp to negotiate exclusively with Company
C. No other indications of interest from parties other than Salem Five Bancorp and Company C were received.
 

Following discussions between Salem Five Bancorp and KBW, on August 4, 2016, Salem Five Bancorp submitted a revised indication of interest that contained a fixed, all-cash

At a special meeting held on August 8, 2016, the Board of Directors discussed with KBW the process and status to date, and KBW reported on the two indications of interest that
had been received, and reviewed and discussed the terms of the two indications of interest.  The Board compared the pricing metrics of the indications of interest against those of selected
New England merger transactions (transactions announced since January 1, 2013 where the target company had assets of less than $500 million).  The price to tangible book ratio of
151.7% offered by Salem Five Bancorp was just below the top quartile of pricing for these transactions, while the price to tangible book ratio of 134.7% offered by Company C was closer
to the median pricing for these transactions.  Counsel again discussed with the Board its fiduciary duties, and the Board voted to authorize the special committee and

management to negotiate an exclusivity agreement with Salem Five Bancorp.  Upon execution of the exclusivity agreement, the special committee and management were authorized to

exclusivity agreement was executed on August 9, 2016, and provided that Georgetown Bancorp would negotiate exclusively with Salem Five Bancorp until September 16, 2016.
 

Salem Five Bancorp continued due diligence over the next few weeks.  At its regular meeting on August 22, 2016, the Board of Directors discussed with KBW the process to date
and expected future events.  Georgetown Bancorp’s management, with the assistance of legal counsel, conducted in-person due diligence on Salem Five Bancorp on August 25, 2016,

view, to the holders of Georgetown Bancorp common stock.  After further discussion, and taking into consideration the factors described under “—Georgetown Bancorp’s Reasons for the
Merger and Recommendation of the Board of Directors that Georgetown Bancorp Stockholders Vote “FOR” Approval of the Merger Agreement,” the Board of Directors voted

completed.

 
·                                          The fact that a termination fee of $2.0 million would have to be paid to Salem Five Bancorp under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement and

The Board of Directors evaluated the factors described above and reached a unanimous determination that the merger was in the best interests of Georgetown Bancorp and its

stockholders. In reaching its determination to approve and recommend the transaction, Georgetown Bancorp’s Board of Directors looked at the totality of the information presented to it
and did not assign any relative or specific weights to any of the individual factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board of
Directors considered these factors as a whole, including the potential risks, uncertainties and disadvantages associated with the merger, and overall considered the benefits of the merger to
be favorable and outweigh the potential risks, uncertainties and disadvantages of the merger. It should be noted that this explanation of the Board of Directors’ reasoning and certain other
information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-
Looking Information.”
 

The Board of Directors unanimously determined that the merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and in the best interests of
Georgetown Bancorp and its stockholders. The Board of Directors also unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are consistent with,
and in furtherance of, Georgetown Bancorp’s business strategies. Accordingly, the Board of Directors unanimously approved and adopted the Merger Agreement and the merger
and unanimously recommends that Georgetown Bancorp stockholders vote “FOR” approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger.
 

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board of Directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but constitutes the material factors
considered by the Board. In reaching its unanimous determination to approve and recommend the Merger Agreement, the Board did not assign any relative or specific weights
to the foregoing factors, and individual directors may have weighed factors differently. The terms of the Merger Agreement were the product of arm’s-length negotiations
between representatives of Georgetown Bancorp and Salem Five Bancorp.
 
Opinion of Georgetown Bancorp’s Financial Advisor
 

Georgetown Bancorp engaged KBW to render financial advisory and investment banking services to Georgetown Bancorp, including an opinion to the Georgetown Bancorp
Board of Directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Georgetown Bancorp common stock of the merger consideration to be received by such stockholders
in the merger. Georgetown Bancorp selected KBW because KBW is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. As
part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of financial services businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions.
 

As part of its engagement, representatives of KBW attended the meeting of the Georgetown Bancorp Board held on October 5, 2016, at which the Georgetown Bancorp Board
evaluated the proposed merger.  At this meeting,

KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger and rendered to the Georgetown Bancorp Board an opinion to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW as set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration to be received
by the holders of Georgetown Bancorp common stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Georgetown Bancorp common stock. The
Georgetown Bancorp Board unanimously approved the Merger Agreement at the October 5, 2016 meeting.
 

The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement and is
incorporated herein by reference, and describes the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW in
preparing the opinion.  KBW has consented to the inclusion of its opinion letter as Appendix B to this proxy statement.
 

KBW’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion.  The opinion was directed to the Georgetown Bancorp Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its
consideration of the financial terms of the merger. The opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to the holders of
Georgetown Bancorp common stock.  It did not address the underlying business decision to engage in the merger or enter into the Merger Agreement or constitute a
recommendation to the Georgetown Bancorp Board in connection with the merger, and it does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Georgetown Bancorp common

not any such stockholder should enter into a voting, stockholders’, or affiliates’ agreement with respect to the merger or exercise any dissenters’ or appraisal rights that may be
available to such stockholder.
 

KBW’s opinion was reviewed and approved by KBW’s Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with its policies and procedures established under the requirements of
Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

·                                          other financial information concerning the business and operations of Georgetown Bancorp and Salem Five Bancorp that was furnished to KBW by Georgetown

Bancorp or Salem Five Bancorp or that KBW was otherwise directed to use for purposes of KBW’s analyses.

Table of Contents
 

KBW’s consideration of financial information and other factors that it deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to its analyses included, among others, the
following:
 

·                                          the historical and current financial position and results of operations of Georgetown Bancorp;
 

·                                          the assets and liabilities of Georgetown Bancorp;
 

·                                          the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the banking industry;
 

·                                          a comparison of certain financial and stock market information for Georgetown Bancorp with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are
publicly traded; and

 
·                                          financial and operating forecasts and projections of Georgetown Bancorp that were prepared by, and provided to KBW and discussed with KBW by, Georgetown

Bancorp management and that were used and relied upon by KBW at the direction of such management and with the consent of the Georgetown Bancorp Board.
 

KBW also performed such other studies and analyses as it considered appropriate and took into account its assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and
its experience in other transactions, as well as its experience in securities valuation and knowledge of the banking industry generally. KBW also participated in discussions that were held
with the respective managements of Georgetown Bancorp and Salem Five Bancorp regarding the past and current business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and future
prospects of their respective companies and such other matters as KBW deemed relevant to its inquiry. In addition, KBW considered the results of the efforts undertaken by or on behalf of
Georgetown Bancorp, with KBW’s assistance, to solicit indications of interest from third parties regarding a potential transaction with Georgetown Bancorp.
 

In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, KBW relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information that was provided
to it or that was publicly available and did not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of any such information or assume any responsibility or liability for such verification,
accuracy or completeness. KBW relied upon the management of Georgetown Bancorp as to the reasonableness and achievability of the financial and operating forecasts and projections of
Georgetown Bancorp referred to above (and the assumptions and bases therefor) that were prepared by, and provided to KBW and discussed with KBW by, such management and KBW
assumed that such forecasts and projections were reasonably prepared on a bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of such management and that such
forecasts and projections would be realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated by such management.
 

It is understood that such forecasts, projections and estimates provided to KBW and used and relied upon by it were not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure, that all
such information was based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive
conditions and that, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such forecasts, projections and estimates. KBW assumed, based on discussions with the
management of Georgetown Bancorp and with the consent of Georgetown Bancorp, that the forecasts, estimates and projections of Georgetown Bancorp that were prepared and provided
to KBW by Georgetown Bancorp management provided a reasonable basis upon which KBW could form its opinion and KBW expressed no view as to any such information or the
assumptions or bases therefor. KBW relied on all such information without independent verification or analysis and did not in any respect assume any responsibility or liability for the
accuracy or completeness thereof.
 

KBW also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of Georgetown Bancorp since the
date of the last financial statements that were made available to KBW. KBW is not an expert in the independent verification of the adequacy of allowances for loan and lease losses and
KBW assumed, without independent verification and with Georgetown Bancorp’s consent,
 

23

Table of Contents
 

that the aggregate allowances for loan and lease losses for Georgetown Bancorp are adequate to cover such losses. In rendering its opinion, KBW did not make or obtain any evaluations
or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Georgetown Bancorp or Salem Five Bancorp, the collateral securing any of such assets
or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor did KBW examine any individual loan or credit files, nor did it evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of
Georgetown Bancorp or Salem Five Bancorp under any state or federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters. Estimates of values of companies and
assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be bought or sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to
uncertainty, KBW assumed no responsibility or liability for their accuracy.

KBW assumed that, in all respects material to its analyses:

 
·                                          the merger and any related transaction (including the bank subsidiary merger) would be completed substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in the draft merger

agreement (the final terms of which KBW assumed would not differ in any respect material to KBW’s analyses from the draft version reviewed by KBW) with no
adjustments to the merger consideration and with no other payments in respect of Georgetown Bancorp common stock;

 
·                                          the representations and warranties of each party in the Merger Agreement and in all related documents and instruments referred to in the Merger Agreement were true

and correct;
 

·                                          each party to the Merger Agreement and all related documents would perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by such party under such
documents;

 
·                                          there were no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary regulatory or governmental approval for the merger or any related transaction

(including the bank subsidiary merger) and that all conditions to the completion of the merger and any related transaction (including the bank subsidiary merger) would
be satisfied without any waivers or modifications to the Merger Agreement or any of the related documents; and

 
·                                          in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the merger and any related transaction (including the bank subsidiary

merger), no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have a
material adverse effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of Georgetown Bancorp.

 
KBW assumed that the merger would be consummated in a manner that complied with all applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. KBW was further advised

by Georgetown Bancorp that Georgetown Bancorp relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or other appropriate sources as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting
and regulatory matters with respect to Georgetown Bancorp, Salem Five Bancorp, Bright Star, Inc., the merger and any related transaction (including the bank subsidiary merger), and the
Merger Agreement. KBW did not provide advice with respect to any such matters.
 

KBW’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of such opinion, to the holders of Georgetown Bancorp common stock of the merger
consideration to be received by such stockholders in the merger. KBW expressed no view or opinion as to any other terms or aspects of the merger or any term or aspect of any related
transaction (including the bank subsidiary merger), including without limitation, the form or structure of the merger or any related transaction, any consequences of the merger or any
related transaction to Georgetown Bancorp, its stockholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects, merits or implications of any employment, consulting, voting, support,
stockholder or other agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the merger or otherwise. KBW’s opinion was necessarily based upon
conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of such opinion and the information made available to KBW through such date. Developments subsequent to the date of
KBW’s opinion may have affected, and may affect, the conclusion reached in KBW’s opinion and KBW did not and does not have an obligation to
 

24

Table of Contents
 
update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. KBW’s opinion did not address, and KBW expressed no view or opinion with respect to:
 

·                                    the underlying business decision of Georgetown Bancorp to engage in the merger or enter into the Merger Agreement;
 

·                                    the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that are, have been or may be available to or contemplated by Georgetown Bancorp or the
Georgetown Bancorp Board;

 
·                                    the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of Georgetown Bancorp’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the

compensation to the holders of Georgetown Bancorp common stock;
 

·                                    the effect of the merger or any related transaction on, or the fairness of any consideration to be received by, holders of any class of securities of Georgetown Bancorp
(other than the holders of Georgetown Bancorp common stock (solely with respect to the merger consideration, as described in KBW’s opinion and not relative to any
consideration to be received by holders of any other class of securities)) or any other party to any transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

 
·                                    whether Salem Five Bancorp has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it to pay the merger consideration to the holders of

Georgetown Bancorp common stock at the closing of the merger;
 

·                                    any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement; or
 

·                                    any legal, financial reporting, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to Georgetown Bancorp, Salem Five Bancorp, their respective stockholders, Bright
Star, Inc., or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the merger or any related transaction (including the bank subsidiary merger).

 
In performing its analyses, KBW made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other

matters, which are beyond the control of KBW and Georgetown Bancorp. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by KBW are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be bought or sold. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty. In addition, the KBW opinion was among several factors taken into consideration by the Georgetown Bancorp Board in making its determination to approve the Merger
Agreement and the merger. Consequently, the analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the Georgetown Bancorp Board with respect to the
fairness of the merger consideration. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were determined through negotiation between Georgetown Bancorp and Salem Five
Bancorp and the decision of Georgetown Bancorp to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Georgetown Bancorp Board.
 

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by KBW to the Georgetown Bancorp Board in connection with its opinion. The summary is not a
complete description of the financial analyses underlying the opinion or the presentation made by KBW to the Georgetown Bancorp Board, but summarizes the material analyses
performed and presented in connection with such opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format.  The tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of the financial analyses.  The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process involving various determinations as to appropriate and relevant methods
of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances.  Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, KBW did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it

considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor.  Accordingly, KBW believes that its analyses and the summary of its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented below in tabular format, without considering all
analyses and factors or the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion.
 

Selected Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial performance, financial condition and market performance of Georgetown
Bancorp to 10 selected banks and thrifts headquartered in the Northeastern region (defined as Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont) that were
publicly traded with total assets between $200 million and $500 million. Announced merger targets and mutual holding companies were excluded from the selected companies.
 

The selected companies were as follows:
 

SBT Bancorp, Inc. (CT) Ledyard Financial Group, Inc. (NH)
Guaranty Bancorp, Inc. (NH) Middlebury National Corporation (VT)
Grand Bank Corporation (MA) First Colebrook Bancorp, Inc. (NH)
Peoples Trust Company of St. Albans (VT) Melrose Bancorp, Inc. (MA)
First Suffield Financial, Inc. (CT) Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. (MA)

 
To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability data and other financial information as of, or for the latest 12 months (“LTM”) or most recent reported quarter ended, June 30,

2016 and market pricing data as of September 30, 2016. Where consolidated holding company level financial data for the selected companies was unreported, subsidiary bank level data
was utilized to calculate ratios. Certain financial data prepared by KBW, and as referenced in the tables presented below, may not correspond to the data presented in Georgetown
Bancorp’s historical financial statements, as a result of the different period, assumptions and methods used by KBW to compute the financial data presented.

For each selected transaction, KBW derived the following implied transaction statistics, in each case based on the transaction consideration value paid for the acquired company
and using financial data based on the latest publicly available financial statements for the acquired company available prior to the announcement of the respective transaction:
 

·                                          Price per common share to LTM earnings per share (“EPS”) of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions involving a private acquired company, this
transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by LTM net income);

 
·                                          Price per common share to book value per share of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions involving a private acquired company, this transaction

statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by total common equity);
 

·                                          Price per common share to tangible book value per share of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions involving a private acquired company, this
transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by total tangible common equity); and

 
·                                          Tangible equity premium to core deposits (total deposits less time deposits greater than $100,000) of the acquired company, referred to as core deposit premium;

No company or transaction used in the selected transaction analysis is identical to Georgetown Bancorp or the proposed merger. Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not
mathematical. Rather, it involved complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved.
 

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. KBW performed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate a range for the implied equity value of Georgetown Bancorp. In this analysis,
KBW used financial forecasts and projections relating to the earnings and assets of Georgetown Bancorp prepared by and provided to KBW by Georgetown Bancorp management, and
assumed discount rates ranging from 14.0% to 18.0%. The range of values was determined by adding (i) the present value of estimated free cash flows that Georgetown Bancorp could
generate over the five-year period from 2016 to 2021 as a stand-alone company and (ii) the present value of implied terminal values of Georgetown Bancorp at the end of such period.
KBW assumed that Georgetown Bancorp would maintain a tangible common equity / tangible asset ratio of 8.00% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain that level. KBW
derived implied terminal values using two methodologies, one based on tangible book value multiples and the other based on 2021 earnings multiples. Using implied terminal values for
Georgetown Bancorp calculated by applying a terminal multiple range of 85.0% to 105.0% to Georgetown Bancorp’s estimated tangible book value as of December 31, 2021, this
discounted cash flow analysis resulted in a range of implied values per share of Georgetown Bancorp stock of approximately $11.02 to $14.65 per share. Using implied terminal values for
Georgetown Bancorp calculated by applying a terminal multiple range of 13.0x to 17.0x to Georgetown Bancorp’s estimated 2021 earnings, this discounted cash flow analysis resulted in
a range of implied values per share of Georgetown Bancorp stock of approximately $10.53 to $14.61 per share.
 

The discounted cash flow analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly dependent on the assumptions, including asset and
earnings growth rates, dividend payout rates, terminal values and discount rates. The analysis did not purport to be indicative of the actual values or expected values of Georgetown
Bancorp.
 

Miscellaneous. KBW acted as financial advisor to Georgetown Bancorp and not as an advisor to or agent of any other person. As part of KBW’s investment banking business,
KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of bank and bank holding company securities in connection with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, KBW has experience in, and knowledge of, the
valuation of banking enterprises. In the ordinary course of their broker-dealer businesses and pursuant to certain existing sales and trading relationships, KBW and its affiliates may from
time to time purchase securities from, and sell securities to, Georgetown Bancorp and Salem Five Bancorp, and as market makers in securities, KBW and its affiliates may from time to
time have a long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of Georgetown Bancorp  for its and their own accounts and for the accounts of its and their respective
customers and clients.
 

Pursuant to the KBW engagement agreement, Georgetown Bancorp agreed to pay KBW a total cash fee equal to 1.10% of the aggregate merger consideration, $100,000 of which
became payable to KBW with the

rendering of KBW’s opinion and the balance of which is contingent upon the completion of the merger. Georgetown Bancorp also agreed to reimburse KBW for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and disbursements incurred in connection with its engagement and to indemnify KBW against certain liabilities relating to or arising out of KBW’s engagement or KBW’s role in
connection therewith. Other than in connection with this present engagement, during the two years preceding the date of its opinion, KBW has not provided investment banking and
financial advisory services to Georgetown Bancorp. During the two years preceding the date of its opinion, KBW has not provided investment banking and financial advisory services to
Salem Five Bancorp. KBW may in the future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to Georgetown Bancorp or Salem Five Bancorp and receive compensation for
such services.
 
Certain Prospective Financial Information Provided by Georgetown Bancorp
 

Georgetown Bancorp does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to its future performance, earnings or other results due to, among other
things, the inherent uncertainty of certain underlying assumptions and estimates. However, during the third quarter of 2016, Georgetown Bancorp provided to Salem Five Bancorp a
summary of certain internal financial forecasts prepared in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015, and updated these projections in the third fiscal quarter of 2016. These internal financial
forecasts were prepared by Georgetown Bancorp’s management as part of the annual budget process. A summary of these financial forecasts is included in this proxy statement because
such forecasts were made available to Salem Five Bancorp. They were also provided to KBW, along with other prospective financial information described below.
 

The selected financial forecasts described below were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or compliance with published guidelines of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for Prospective Financial Information, or generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”), and are included in this proxy statement only because they were made available in part to Salem Five Bancorp and KBW in connection with the proposed merger. The
prospective financial information included in this proxy statement has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Georgetown Bancorp’s management. Georgetown Bancorp’s
independent auditor, Baker Newman & Noyes, P.A., LLC, did not examine, compile or perform any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information described below and,
accordingly, such firm does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
 

The financial forecasts described below are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such
estimates and should be read with caution. Although presented with numerical specificity, these estimates are based upon a variety of assumptions made by Georgetown Bancorp’s
management with respect to, among other things, industry performance, general economic, market, interest rate, and financial conditions, the timing and level of new loan originations and
deposit generation, operating and other revenues and expenses, effective tax rates, capital expenditures, working capital and other matters. Some or all of the assumptions may not be
realized, and as historical performance suggests, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to
predict and many of which are beyond the control of Georgetown Bancorp. In addition, some of these assumptions, by their nature, are subjective in many respects.
 

Accordingly, the assumptions made in preparing these estimates may prove to be inaccurate and actual results may differ materially from these estimates. In addition, the
forecasts do not take into account any of the expense savings or charges expected to result from the merger or any other matters contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including
limitations imposed in the Merger Agreement on Georgetown Bancorp’s ability to engage in certain activities pending completion of the merger without Salem Five Bancorp’s consent.
 

For these reasons, the description of the financial forecasts in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that they are necessarily predictive of actual future
performance and they should not be relied on as such. No one has made, or makes, any representation regarding these estimates by their inclusion in this proxy statement and, except as
may be required by applicable securities laws, Georgetown Bancorp does not intend to update or otherwise revise the projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date when
made or to reflect the occurrences of future events even if any or all of the assumptions underlying the projections are shown to be in

error. For additional information on factors that may cause future financial results to materially vary from those reflected in the projections prepared by Georgetown Bancorp’s
management, see the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information.”
 

Below are certain financial projections that were prepared by Georgetown Bancorp’s management and were provided to Salem Five Bancorp in connection with the proposed

Georgetown Bancorp did not provide Salem Five Bancorp updated financial information at or for the year ending December 31, 2018.
 

The prospective financial information for Georgetown Bancorp that was provided to KBW (but not Salem Five Bancorp) by Georgetown Bancorp’s management and utilized and
relied upon by KBW, as described in “—
 

32

Table of Contents
 
Opinion of Georgetown Bancorp’s Financial Advisor,” included additional information from the financial projections disclosed above. Specifically, KBW was provided with and used the
following: (a) that Georgetown Bancorp’s asset growth would be 7.5% per year after a 2018 estimate of $376 million; and (b) that Georgetown Bancorp’s earnings estimates (before
expected cost savings) would be $1.1 million ($0.62 per share) in 2018, $1.5 million ($0.85 per share) in 2019, $1.9 million ($1.07 per share) in 2020 and $2.3 million ($1.30 per share) in
2021.
 
Surrender of Certificates; Payment of Merger Consideration
 

No later than one business day prior to the effective time of the merger, Salem Five Bancorp will deposit with an exchange agent cash in an amount equal to $26.00 per
outstanding share of Georgetown Bancorp common stock, other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The exchange agent will facilitate the payment of the
merger consideration to the holders of certificates representing shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock. Salem Five Bancorp will select an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to
Georgetown Bancorp.
 

As promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger, but no later than five business days after the effective time of the merger, the exchange agent will mail to each
holder of record of Georgetown Bancorp common stock certificates a letter of transmittal with instructions on how to surrender certificates representing shares of Georgetown Bancorp
common stock for the merger consideration.
 

Please do not send in your Georgetown Bancorp stock certificates until you receive the letter of transmittal and instructions from the exchange agent. Do not return
your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy.
 

After you mail the letter of transmittal and your Georgetown Bancorp stock certificates in accordance with the instructions you will receive, you will then be mailed a check in
the amount of cash for the merger consideration that you are entitled to receive. The stock certificates you surrender will be canceled. You will not be entitled to receive interest on any
portion of the merger consideration.
 

Any portion of the merger consideration that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Georgetown Bancorp for more than 12 months after the effective time of the merger will
be repaid to Salem Five Bancorp. If you have not complied with the exchange procedures described above within the time period previously described, you may only look to Salem Five
Bancorp for payment of the merger consideration you are entitled to receive in exchange for your shares of common stock, without any interest, and subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat and similar laws.
 

If your Georgetown Bancorp stock certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, you will be required to sign an affidavit before you receive any consideration for your shares.
The exchange agent will send you instructions on how to complete such an affidavit. You may be required to post a bond in an amount sufficient to protect Salem Five Bancorp,
Georgetown Bancorp, the exchange agent or any of their respective representatives or agents against claims related to your common stock.
 

Salem Five Bancorp or the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the merger consideration otherwise payable to any Georgetown Bancorp stockholder the
amounts Salem Five Bancorp or the exchange agent, as the case may be, are required to deduct and withhold under any applicable federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If Salem Five
Bancorp or the exchange agent withholds any amounts, these amounts will be treated for all purposes of the merger as having been paid to the stockholders from whom they were
withheld.
 
Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders
 

The following is a discussion of certain federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of Georgetown Bancorp common stock whose shares
are converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash per share at closing. This discussion does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to
Georgetown Bancorp stockholders. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applicable current and proposed U.S.
Treasury
 

33

Table of Contents
 

Regulations, judicial authority, and administrative rulings and practice, all of which are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. Any such change could alter the tax
consequences described herein.
 

For purposes of this discussion, we use the term “U.S. holder” to mean a beneficial owner of shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock that is:
 

·                                          an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
 

·                                          a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof (or the District of Columbia);
 

·                                          a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions
of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or

 
·                                          an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

 
This discussion assumes that the Georgetown Bancorp common stock is held for investment purposes. This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S federal income tax that

may be relevant to a Georgetown Bancorp stockholder in light of its particular circumstances, or that may apply to a Georgetown Bancorp stockholder that is subject to special treatment
under the U.S. federal income tax laws (including but not limited to foreign persons (generally, a person that is not a citizen or resident of the United States, a U.S. domestic corporation,
or a person that would otherwise be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis with respect to their Georgetown Bancorp common stock), financial institutions, tax-exempt
organizations, dealers in securities or foreign currencies, entities that are treated for federal income tax purposes as partnerships or other pass-through entities, insurance companies or
employees who acquired the stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements). This discussion is for general information only and is not
tax advice. The U.S. federal income tax consequences described below are not intended to constitute a complete description of all tax consequences relating to the merger.
Georgetown Bancorp stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the tax consequences to them of, including the application and effect of any U.S.
federal, state, local and foreign income, estate, gift and other tax laws to, the receipt of the cash consideration in exchange for Georgetown Bancorp common stock pursuant to
the merger.



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1542299/000110465917000182/a16-21651_1defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1542299/000110465917000182/a16-21651_1defm14a.htm 24/72

 
The receipt of the merger consideration by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for

U.S. federal income tax purposes (and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and foreign income or other tax laws). For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.
holder of Georgetown Bancorp common stock generally will recognize capital gain or loss at the effective time of the merger equal to the difference, if any, between:
 

·                                          $26.00 in cash received by the U.S. holder in exchange for such Georgetown Bancorp common stock; and
 

·                                          the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Georgetown Bancorp common stock.
 

Such gain or loss generally will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period for the Georgetown Bancorp common stock surrendered in the merger
exceeds one year as of the date of the merger. In general, long-term capital gain of individuals currently is subject to U.S. federal income tax at a maximum rate of 20%. The deductibility
of capital losses is subject to limitations under the Code. The amount and character of gain or loss must be determined separately for each block of Georgetown Bancorp common stock
(i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) exchanged for the merger consideration in the merger.
 

34

Table of Contents
 

Under the Code, the cash consideration received in the merger by a U.S. holder may be subject to U.S. information reporting and backup withholding. Backup withholding
(currently at a rate of 28%) will apply with respect to the amount of cash received by a non-corporate U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or a
correct taxpayer identification number on an IRS Form W-9 (enclosed with the letter of transmittal sent by the exchange agent), and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements
of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a U.S.
holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.
 

THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION DOES NOT CLAIM TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF THE POTENTIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER.
GEORGETOWN BANCORP STOCKHOLDERS ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO
THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN INCOME, ESTATE, GIFT AND
OTHER TAX LAWS IN THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. NOTHING IN THIS DISCUSSION IS INTENDED TO BE, OR SHOULD BE CONSTRUED AS, TAX
ADVICE.
 
Certain Effects of the Merger
 

If the Merger Agreement and the merger are approved by Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders and certain other conditions to the closing of the merger are either satisfied or
waived, Bright Star, Inc., the merger subsidiary of Salem Five Bancorp, will merge with and into Georgetown Bancorp, with Georgetown Bancorp as the surviving corporation, and
thereafter Georgetown Bancorp will be dissolved and liquidated into Salem Five Bancorp. As a result, the separate corporate existence of Georgetown Bancorp will cease, and Salem Five
Bancorp will continue as the surviving entity. In addition, Georgetown Bank will merge with and into Salem Five Cents Savings Bank. As a result of the bank merger, the separate
corporate existence of Georgetown Bank will cease, and Salem Five Cents Savings Bank will continue as the surviving entity.
 

When the merger is completed, each share of common stock of Georgetown Bancorp (other than shares of common stock owned by Georgetown Bancorp as treasury stock or
owned by any subsidiary of Georgetown Bancorp) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash
per share at closing. At the effective time of the merger, Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders will cease to have ownership interests in Georgetown Bancorp or rights as stockholders of
Georgetown Bancorp.
 

Georgetown Bancorp’s shares of common stock are currently registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market
under the symbol “GTWN.” As a result of the merger, Georgetown Bancorp’s common shares will cease to be traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market. In addition, the registration of
Georgetown Bancorp common shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, will be terminated, and Georgetown Bancorp will no longer file periodic and other reports
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Effects on Georgetown Bancorp and Our Stockholders if the Merger is Not Completed
 

If the Merger Agreement is not approved by Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders will
not receive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Georgetown Bancorp would be obligated to
pay a $2.0 million termination fee to Salem Five Bancorp. For a description of the circumstances obligating payment of the termination fee, see “—Termination Fee.”
 
Appraisal Rights
 

Under Georgetown Bancorp’s Articles of Incorporation, Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders are not entitled to exercise any rights of an objecting stockholder provided under
Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the Maryland General
 

35

Table of Contents
 
Corporation Law, unless the Board of Directors determines that such rights apply with respect to a transaction. The Board of Directors of Georgetown Bancorp has not made such a
determination with respect to the merger. Accordingly, the stockholders of Georgetown Bancorp do not have appraisal rights with respect to the merger.
 
Financial Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
 

As described below, certain of Georgetown Bancorp’s executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that are in addition to, or different from, the interests of
Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders generally. Georgetown Bancorp’s Board of Directors was aware of these interests and took them into account in approving the merger. These interests
represent an aggregate estimated amount of approximately $3.8 million and include the following:
 

Stock Options. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, outstanding and unexercised stock options to purchase shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock granted under
Georgetown Bancorp’s 2009 Equity Incentive Plan and 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, whether or not vested or exercisable, will become fully vested and will entitle the holder to a cash
payment equal to the excess of the merger consideration over the exercise price per option multiplied by the number of stock options held, less applicable taxes required to be withheld. 
Set forth below is the number of outstanding and unexercised stock options held by each director and executive officer and the weighted-average exercise price of each individual’s stock
options:

Acceleration of Vesting of Restricted Stock Awards. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Georgetown Bancorp restricted stock awards that have not yet vested will

become fully vested and will be exchanged for the merger consideration at the completion of the merger. Based upon the equity holdings as of the Georgetown Bancorp record date, the
number of unvested restricted stock awards that will become vested as a result of the merger held by the executive officers and non-employee directors of Georgetown Bancorp, assuming
the merger closes on March 31, 2017, are as follows:

Employment Agreements and Change in Control Agreements. Georgetown Bancorp and Georgetown Bank are parties to employment agreements with each of Messrs. Robert
E. Balletto and Joseph W. Kennedy, and Georgetown Bank is a party to a change in control agreement with Mr. Frederick Weismann, which agreements provide for severance benefits that
may be triggered on termination of employment in connection with the merger.   Salem Five Bancorp has agreed to have Georgetown Bancorp and Georgetown Bank terminate these
agreements in connection with the merger and to make certain payments to the executives in consideration of the termination of such agreements, provided, that no payments will be made
that will result in excess parachute payments under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.
 

The estimated cash payments that would be made to Messrs. Balletto and Kennedy in cancellation of their employment agreements and to Mr. Weismann in cancellation of his
change in control agreement are approximately $778,158, $531,032 and $184,000, respectively, which takes into consideration the estimated reductions necessary to avoid penalties under
Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.
 

Continued Employment Offer to Certain Georgetown Bancorp Named Executive Officers. Salem Five Cents Savings Bank has offered continued employment to
Messrs. Balletto and Kennedy pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth below, subject to any regulatory limitations. As a condition to accepting continued employment with Salem
Five Cents Savings Bank, each executive has agreed to terminate his existing employment agreement or change in control agreement with Georgetown Bancorp and/or Georgetown Bank,
as applicable.
 

Each of Mr. Balletto and Mr. Kennedy has entered into a one-year employment agreement with Salem Five Cents Savings Bank that will pay an annual rate of base salary of
$241,500, with respect to Mr. Balletto, and $234,400, with respect to Mr. Kennedy.  In addition to base salary, each executive will receive a bonus at the end of the employment agreement
term of $60,300 in the case of Mr. Balletto, and $58,600 in the case of Mr. Kennedy.  In addition, the executives will be entitled to participate in medical, dental, disability, retirement, life
insurance and other employee benefits on the same basis as may be provided to other similarly situated employees, will be entitled to reasonable sick and vacation leave consistent with
Salem Five Cents Savings Bank’s policies, and will be entitled to a continuation of their existing split dollar life insurance benefits for a period of three years following the closing date.
 

In the event of either Mr. Balletto’s or Mr. Kennedy’s (i) involuntary termination without cause by Salem Five Cents Savings Bank or (ii) resignation for good reason (as defined
in the employment agreements), the executive will be entitled to any accrued but unpaid benefits, his base salary and bonus compensation that he would have earned had he remained
employed with Salem Five Cents Savings Bank through the last day of the one-year employment term and the continuation of his split dollar death benefit for the term set forth in the
employment agreement.  In addition, in exchange for an additional payment of $301,800, in the case of Mr. Balletto, and $293,000, in the case of Mr. Kennedy, each of the executives will
be subject to a restrictive covenant that will generally preclude their ability, without written consent, to compete with Salem Five Cents Savings Bank, within a

25-mile radius of any branch office of Salem Five Cents Savings Bank or to solicit any customer or employee of Salem Five Cents Savings Bank for the restrictive period that ends on the
later of the one-year anniversary after the executive’s employment terminates or the one-year anniversary of the scheduled expiration date of the executive’s employment agreement.  In
addition, each of Mr. Balletto and Mr. Kennedy will be required to enter into a release of claims in order to receive the payments under the employment agreement, including the
restrictive covenant payment.
 

Executive Supplemental Retirement Agreements. Georgetown Bank is a party to Executive Supplemental Retirement Agreements with Messrs. Balletto and Kennedy. Under
these agreements, Messrs. Balletto and Kennedy are each entitled to a supplemental retirement benefit that is payable upon termination following attainment of his normal retirement age,
which is age 65. The normal retirement benefit is a lump sum amount that is the actuarial equivalent of an annual lifetime benefit (for 20 years certain) equal to 45% of the executive’s
final average compensation, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the executive’s years of employment with Georgetown Bank and the denominator of which is 23. The
executive’s final average compensation is based on the three fiscal years of the last five fiscal years of employment with Georgetown Bank in which the executive’s base salary and bonus
was the highest. If the executive has a separation from service prior to age 65 (other than due to death, disability or cause), the executive is entitled to his accrued annuity benefit
calculated in the manner set forth above, and if applicable multiplied by the executive’s vesting rate set forth in his participation agreement. If the executive is less than age 62 at the time
of commencement of the supplemental benefit, his benefit will be further reduced by 5% per year for each year prior to age 62 that the benefit payment commences.  In the event of a



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1542299/000110465917000182/a16-21651_1defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1542299/000110465917000182/a16-21651_1defm14a.htm 26/72

change in control, followed by the executive’s involuntary separation from service within two years, the executive would be entitled to a lump sum payment that is the actuarial equivalent
of the normal retirement benefit, assuming the executive had reached age 65 at the time of the change in control and received a five percent increase in base salary for each year until age
65.  Assuming the merger is consummated at March 31, 2017, the lump sum payment would be the actuarial equivalent of an annual benefit of $98,569 for Mr. Balletto, and $52,807 for
Mr. Kennedy, subject to reduction to avoid an excess parachute payment.  The present value of the benefit is payable in a lump sum within 90 days of the executive’s separation from
service.  In order to be entitled to the benefit, each executive is required to enter into a general release of claims.
 

In accordance with the Merger Agreement, Georgetown Bank and Salem Five Bancorp have agreed to terminate the Executive Supplemental Retirement Agreements and
distribute the present value of the vested accrued benefits thereunder in a lump sum payment at the effective time of the merger in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.  In order to
avoid an excess parachute payment under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, the parties have agreed that the executives will receive only their fully vested and accrued benefits under
the Executive Supplemental Retirement Agreements, without regard to the change in control.
 

Assuming a merger date of March 31, 2017, and taking into consideration of the reduction of the stated change in control benefit under the Executive Supplemental Retirement
Agreements to avoid an excess parachute payment, the estimated accrued benefit that will be payable under the Executive Supplemental Retirement Agreements is as follows:
Mr. Balletto, $1,219,927 and, Mr. Kennedy, $550,364.
 

Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The Georgetown Bank ESOP is a tax-qualified plan that covers substantially all of the employees of Georgetown Bank who have at least one
year of service and have attained age 21.  The ESOP received a loan from Georgetown Bancorp, the proceeds of which were used to acquire shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock
for the benefit of plan participants. The ESOP has pledged the shares acquired with the loan as collateral for the loan and holds them in a suspense account, releasing them to participants’
accounts as the loan is repaid, with contributions received from Georgetown Bank. Prior to the effective time of the merger, the outstanding balance of the ESOP loan will be repaid by the
ESOP by selling a sufficient number of unallocated shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock to Georgetown Bancorp. All of the Georgetown Bancorp common stock in the ESOP,
including any unallocated shares remaining in the suspense account (after the repayment of the outstanding loan) will be exchanged for the merger consideration.  At the closing of the
merger, the ESOP will be terminated, all participants’ accounts will be fully vested and all shares of Georgetown Bancorp common stock held by the ESOP will be converted into the
merger consideration.  Any remaining proceeds in the suspense account after
 

38

Table of Contents
 
the sale of the suspense account shares will be allocated to ESOP participants in accordance with the terms of the ESOP.
 

As a result of the foregoing, Georgetown Bank’s executive officers, as well as Georgetown Bank’s other employees who participate in the ESOP on the ESOP termination date,
would receive a benefit in connection with the ESOP’s termination to the extent that the stock price of Georgetown Bancorp common stock multiplied by the number of shares held in the
suspense account exceeds the outstanding loan used to acquire those shares.  Assuming the excess assets are allocated to ESOP participants as earnings of the plan based on estimated
compensation for the year ending December 31, 2016, and a stock price of $26.00, the estimated value of the additional benefit that would be payable to the executive officers under the
ESOP at the closing of the merger is as follows: Mr. Balletto, $78,579, Mr. Kennedy, $52,991, and Mr. Weismann, $69,435.
 

Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Georgetown Bancorp’s Named Executive Officers. The following table and related footnotes provide information about the
compensation to be paid to Georgetown Bancorp’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger (the “Merger-Related Executive Compensation”). The
Merger-Related Executive Compensation shown in the table and described in the footnotes below is subject to an advisory (non-binding) vote of Georgetown Bancorp stockholders as
more fully described in “Proposal II—Approval of the Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.”

(1) The amount in this column represents the cash payment that will be made to the executives in connection with the termination of their existing employment and change in control
agreements with Georgetown Bank, subject to adjustment/cutback pursuant to Section 280G of the Code.  The termination of the employment and change in control agreements in
consideration of a cash payment, as required by the Merger Agreement, is a single trigger event upon a change in control and is not conditioned upon the termination of the
executives’ employment.

(2) The amounts in this column represent, with respect to Georgetown Bancorp stock options and restricted stock awards, the total value of the accelerated vesting of outstanding stock
options and restricted stock awards, based on a per share value of $26.00, less the applicable per share exercise price in the case of accelerated stock options.  For Mr. Balletto, his
equity amount represents $79,519 attributable to the value of 9,730 Georgetown Bancorp stock options for which vesting is accelerated and $119,860 attributable to the value of
4,610 Georgetown Bancorp restricted stock awards for which vesting is accelerated. For Mr. Kennedy, his equity amount represents $48,559 attributable to the value of 6,002
Georgetown Bancorp stock options for which vesting is accelerated and $80,210 attributable to the value of 3,085 Georgetown Bancorp restricted stock awards for which vesting is
accelerated.  For Mr. Weismann, his equity amount represents $61,522 attributable to the value of 7,716 Georgetown Bancorp stock options for which vesting is accelerated and
$109,928 attributable to the value of 4,228 Georgetown Bancorp restricted stock awards for which vesting is accelerated.  The amounts set forth in this column include only
amounts for which vesting is accelerated and do not include income recognized on previously vested restricted stock or paid to the executives in exchange for previously vested
stock options.

(3) Since no benefits payable under the Executive Supplemental Retirement Agreements will be enhanced as a result of the merger, no value is reflected in this column for each
executive. However, under the Merger Agreement, the Executive Supplemental Retirement Agreements will be terminated and the accrued benefits thereunder will be distributed
at the effective time of the merger in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. The termination and liquidation of the agreements is a single trigger event upon a change in
control and is not conditioned upon the termination of the executive’s employment. As of March 31, 2017, the estimated accrued benefits payable to each executive under his
Executive Supplemental Retirement Agreement is as follows: Mr. Balletto, $1,219,927 and Mr. Kennedy, $550,364. Mr. Weismann is not a party to an Executive Supplemental
Retirement Agreement with Georgetown Bank.

(4) The amount in this column represents the value of the continued split dollar life insurance coverage for Mr. Balletto and Mr. Kennedy for a period of three years following the
effective date of the merger. 

(5) The amounts in this column represent: (i) with respect to all the executives, the additional benefit attributable to the ESOP as a result of its termination (see “—Financial Interests
of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Employee Stock Ownership Plan” above for further details) and (ii) with respect to Messrs. Balletto and Kennedy, the amount
payable under the restrictive covenant that will be paid following the later of their termination with Salem Five Cents Savings Bank or the end of the term of their one-year
employment agreements (see “—Financial Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Employment Agreements and Change in Control Agreements” above for

further details).  We have not included in the Merger Related Executive Compensation table the amount of salary and bonus that will be paid to Messrs. Balletto and Kennedy

and Executive Officers in the Merger —Employment Agreements and Change in Control Agreements.”

 
Indemnification. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Salem Five Bancorp has agreed that, for a period of six years following the effective time of the merger, it will indemnify,

defend and hold harmless each present and former officer or director of Georgetown Bancorp and its subsidiaries, against any costs or expenses (including
 

40

Table of Contents
 

reasonable attorneys fees) judgments, fines, losses, damages, or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal or administrative, whether arising before or after the effective time of the merger, arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of
Georgetown Bancorp or any of its subsidiaries and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions occurring at or before the closing of the merger (including in connection with the approval of
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement), and will Salem Five Bancorp will also advance expenses to an indemnified party, provided that the
indemnified party to whom any expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is ultimately determined that such indemnified party is not entitled to
indemnification.
 

Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. Salem Five Bancorp has further agreed, for a period of three years after the effective time of the merger, to maintain the current directors’
and officers’ liability insurance policies covering the officers and directors of Georgetown Bancorp (provided, that Salem Five Bancorp may substitute policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially less favorable) with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger. Salem Five Bancorp is
not required to spend, in the aggregate, more than 175% of the annual premiums currently paid by Georgetown Bancorp for its insurance coverage.
 
Regulatory Approvals

Georgetown Bank.

Savings Bank and Georgetown Bank. The approval process also requires a public hearing, which generally occurs within 60 calendar days from the date that the application is submitted.
 
Accounting Treatment
 

Salem Five Bancorp will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting. This means that Salem Five Bancorp and Georgetown Bancorp will be treated as one

Salem Five Bancorp has agreed that, prior to the effective time of the merger (or the termination of the Merger Agreement), except as disclosed to Georgetown Bancorp,
expressly contemplated or permitted by the Merger Agreement, required by law, or with the prior written consent of Georgetown Bancorp, Salem Five Bancorp will not, and will not
permit any of its subsidiaries to, subject to certain exceptions, undertake the following actions:
 

·                                          take any action that is intended or reasonably expected to result in the conditions to the closing of the merger not being satisfied in a timely manner; or
 

·                                          agree to take or make any commitment to take any of the above prohibited actions.
 

Regulatory Matters. Georgetown Bancorp and Salem Five Bancorp have also agreed to cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and
file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications and other similar documents, and to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and governmental entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Salem Five Bancorp and Georgetown
Bancorp have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, any filing made with any third party or governmental entities in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Additionally, Salem Five Bancorp and Georgetown Bancorp agree to consult with each other with respect to obtaining all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of third parties or governmental entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
and each party will keep the other party apprised promptly of the status of filings and applications, including applicable communications with governmental entities.
 

To the extent permitted by law, Georgetown Bancorp and Salem Five Bancorp will promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any governmental entity
pertaining to the merger that causes such

party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any required regulatory approval will not be obtained or may be materially delayed.
 

Employee Benefit Plans. Salem Five Bancorp and Salem Five Cents Savings Bank will honor the terms of all Georgetown Bancorp and Georgetown Bank compensation and
benefit plans, including employment, consulting, change in control, termination and severance agreements, and deferred compensation or supplemental retirement plans, subject to the
terms of the Merger Agreement.   Salem Five Bancorp and/or Salem Five Cents Savings Bank shall provide continuing employees with compensation and benefits that are, in the
aggregate, substantially similar to the compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Salem Five Bancorp and/or Salem Five Cents Savings Bank as of the date
any such compensation or benefit is provided.  Salem Five Bancorp or its applicable subsidiary will offer to Georgetown Bancorp and Georgetown Bank employees who continue to be
employed by Salem Five Bancorp and its subsidiaries health coverage on the same basis as it provides such coverage to similarly situated employees of Salem Five Bancorp and its
subsidiaries, provided, that pre-existing conditions, exclusions, evidence of insurability (other than with respect to life insurance) and waiting periods will be waived for such continuing
employees.  In addition, Salem Five Bancorp and its subsidiaries will recognize all service of continuing Georgetown Bancorp and Georgetown Bank employees for all purposes in any
Salem benefit plan, except: (i) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (ii) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or the
employer premium subsidy under any retiree medical plan, or (iii) for any benefit plan that is frozen or provides a benefit to a grandfathered employee population.
 

Georgetown Tax-Qualified Retirement Plans. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, unless otherwise requested by Salem Five Bancorp no later than 30 days prior to
the closing date of the merger, Georgetown Bank is required to take all necessary action to terminate the Georgetown Bank 401(k) Plan, contingent on the closing.  In the event
Georgetown Bank is required to terminate the Georgetown Bank 401(k) Plan, Salem Five Cents Savings Bank will take all necessary action to ensure that continuing employees who have
satisfied the eligibility requirements as of the date of such termination will be eligible to enter the Salem Five Cents Savings Bank 401(k) Plan as of the effective date of the merger.  In
addition, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, the ESOP shall be terminated at the closing of the merger and all ESOP participants’ accounts shall be fully vested.  The ESOP will
be required to sell a sufficient number of shares in the ESOP suspense account (which would include a sale to Georgetown Bancorp at $26.00 per share) in order to extinguish the ESOP
loan.  In the event that shares exist in the ESOP suspense account following the sale, the remaining shares will be converted to the merger consideration and will be allocated to ESOP
participants who are active employees of Georgetown Bank at the termination date of the ESOP, as earnings, in accordance with the terms of the ESOP.  In the unlikely event that the loan
repayment amount exceeds the proceeds from the sale of the shares in the ESOP suspense account, the remainder of the ESOP loan will be forgiven and Georgetown Bancorp shall have
no further obligation with respect to the ESOP loan.
 

Severance Benefits. Any employee of Georgetown Bank, other than an employee who is a party to an employment agreement, change in control agreement or other separation
agreement that provides a benefit on a termination of employment, whose employment is terminated involuntarily (other than for cause) within one year following the completion of the
merger, shall receive a cash severance payment from Salem Five Cents Savings Bank equal to two weeks’ pay at the base salary or average hourly rate then in effect, for each full year of
employment with Georgetown Bank, subject to a minimum of four weeks and a maximum of 26 weeks. Such employees will also have the right to continued health coverage under group
health plans of Salem Five Cents Savings Bank in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code.
 

Retention Bonuses.  Salem Five Bancorp will establish a retention bonus pool of up to $300,000 to induce key employees of Georgetown Bancorp and Georgetown Bank to
remain employed through specified dates.  The allocation of the retention bonus pool will be jointly determined by the chief executive officers of Salem Five Cents Savings Bank and
Georgetown Bank.
 

D&O Indemnification and Insurance. Salem Five Bancorp has agreed that it will indemnify current and former directors and officers of Georgetown Bancorp and its
subsidiaries for a period of six years following the completion of the merger, and will maintain Georgetown Bancorp’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for three years
following the completion of the merger, subject to a limit on premium payments.  See

Agreement—Financial Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Directors and Officers Insurance” above for a complete description.
 

Certain Additional Covenants. The Merger Agreement also contains additional covenants, including covenants relating to the filing of this proxy statement, filing certain reports
with the SEC, providing notice of a material adverse effect or a breach of a representation, warranty or agreement, obtaining required consents, access to information of the other company
and public announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
 
Georgetown Bancorp’s Stockholder Meeting and Recommendation of Georgetown Bancorp’s Board of Directors
 

Georgetown Bancorp has agreed to hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of voting upon approval of the Merger Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable.
Georgetown Bancorp will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger by its stockholders, including by recommending that its
stockholders approve the Merger Agreement and the merger (subject to the provisions governing making a change in Georgetown Bancorp’s recommendation as described below) and by
retaining a proxy solicitation firm acceptable to Salem Five Bancorp.
 

Georgetown Bancorp’s Board of Directors has unanimously agreed to recommend that Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders vote in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement
and the merger.  Provided, however, that if Georgetown Bancorp’s Board of Directors determines, in good faith, based upon the advice of outside counsel and, with respect to financial



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1542299/000110465917000182/a16-21651_1defm14a.htm

matters, its financial advisor, that it would be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary obligations under applicable law to continue to recommend the Merger Agreement and the merger,
then the Board of Directors may submit the Merger Agreement and the merger to the stockholders without recommendation, in which event the Board of Directors may communicate the
basis for its lack of a recommendation to the extent required by law.
 
Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers
 

Georgetown Bancorp has agreed that it will not, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives not to, directly or
indirectly:
 

·                                         initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to an acquisition proposal;
 

·                                         engage or participate in any negotiations regarding an acquisition proposal; or
 

·                                         provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to any acquisition proposal (as defined
below).

 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, prior to the approval of the Merger Agreement by the Georgetown Bancorp stockholders and after Georgetown Bancorp and its Board

of Directors has concluded in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that such acquisition proposal would
reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal (as defined below), Georgetown Bancorp may, with respect to an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal furnish or cause
to be furnished nonpublic information or data previously provided to Salem Five Bancorp, and participate in negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes
in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that prior to providing any confidential information or data, Georgetown Bancorp will have entered into a confidentiality agreement with
such third party on terms no less favorable to Georgetown Bancorp than the confidentiality agreement with Salem Five Bancorp and which will not provide such person with any exclusive
right to negotiate with Georgetown Bancorp.
 

49

Table of Contents
 

Georgetown Bancorp and its subsidiaries have agreed to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations that had been conducted before
signing of the Merger Agreement with any third party with respect to any acquisition proposal.
 

Georgetown Bancorp must advise Salem Five Bancorp orally within 24 hours, and in writing within two business days, of the receipt of any acquisition proposal or any inquiry
which could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal, and the substance of such proposal. Georgetown Bancorp has also agreed to keep Salem Five Bancorp reasonably
apprised of any developments related to an acquisition proposal.
 

For purposes of the Merger Agreement, an “acquisition proposal” means any offer or proposal relating to any third-party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of Georgetown Bancorp and its subsidiaries or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Georgetown Bancorp
or one or more of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of Georgetown Bancorp, (ii) any tender offer
(including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
Georgetown Bancorp or one or more of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of Georgetown Bancorp, or
(iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving Georgetown Bancorp or
one or more of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of Georgetown Bancorp.
 

For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “superior proposal” means a bona fide unsolicited written acquisition proposal (substituting “50%” for “20%” in the definition
thereof) that the Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisor, taking into account all relevant legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of such offer or proposal and the person making the proposal, that, (i) if consummated, would be more favorable to Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders, from a financial
point of view, than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (after taking into account any proposed revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement) and (ii) is more likely
than not to be completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis.

·                                          if the merger has not been completed by January 5, 2018;

 
·                                          if there is a breach by the non-terminating party of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement,

which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would constitute the failure of a condition to the obligations of the terminating party under the Merger Agreement,
and which is not cured within 30 days (or such fewer days as remain prior to January 5, 2018) following written notice to the breaching party or by its nature or timing
cannot be cured during such period;

 
·                                          if Georgetown Bancorp stockholders fail to approve the Merger Agreement at the special meeting; or

 
·                                          if the Federal Reserve Board or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency requests in writing that Georgetown Bancorp or Salem Five Bancorp withdraw (other than

for technical reasons), and is not be permitted to resubmit within 60 days, any application for regulatory approval.
 

Salem Five Bancorp may terminate the Merger Agreement in the following circumstances:
 

·                                          if Georgetown Bancorp breaches its covenants regarding the solicitation of competing offers or its obligation to call a stockholders’ meeting, if Georgetown Bancorp’s
Board of Directors fails to issue a press release opposing a third-party acquisition proposal within ten business days after such proposal is announced, or if Georgetown
Bancorp’s Board of Directors fails to recommend approval of the merger or withdraws, qualifies, or revises its recommendation to approve the merger; or

 
·                                          if the Federal Reserve Board or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has granted a regulatory approval but such approval contains or would result in the

imposition of a materially burdensome regulatory condition and there is no meaningful possibility that such approval could be revised prior to January 5, 2018.
 

In addition, Georgetown Bancorp may terminate the Merger Agreement after it has received and accepted a superior proposal.
 
Effect of Termination
 

If the Merger Agreement is terminated, it will become void, except that (i) any liability of either Salem Five Bancorp or Georgetown Bancorp for any willful and material breach
of the Merger Agreement will survive the termination, and (ii) designated provisions of the Merger Agreement will survive the termination, including those relating to payment of fees and
expenses and the confidential treatment of information.

Termination Fee
 

In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Georgetown Bancorp must pay Salem Five Bancorp in immediately available funds a
termination fee of $2.0 million.
 

Georgetown Bancorp must pay the termination fee if: (1) Salem Five Bancorp terminates the Merger Agreement as a result of a breach by Georgetown Bancorp of its covenants
regarding the solicitation of competing offers or its obligation to call a stockholders’ meeting, if Georgetown Bancorp’s Board of Directors fails to issue a press release opposing a third-
party acquisition proposal within ten business days after such proposal is announced, or if Georgetown Bancorp’s Board of Directors fails to recommend approval of the merger or
withdraws, qualifies, or revises its recommendation to approve the merger; or (2) Georgetown Bancorp terminates the Merger Agreement after it has received and accepted a superior
proposal.
 

Georgetown Bancorp also must pay the termination fee if: (1) prior to the effective time of the merger, any person shall have made an acquisition proposal, which proposal has
been publicly disclosed or made known to management of Georgetown Bancorp or its stockholders generally, or any person shall have publicly announced or made known to management
of Georgetown Bancorp an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an acquisition proposal, (2) thereafter the Merger Agreement is terminated by (a) either party after January 5,
2018, (b) either party if Georgetown Bancorp has held its stockholders meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) to consider the Merger Agreement and the merger
and stockholders have not approved the Merger Agreement and the merger by the required vote, or (c) Salem Five Bancorp due to a breach by Georgetown Bancorp of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement, which breach would, individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches, result
in the conditions to closing the merger not being satisfied, and which breach either is not cured within a specified time period or cannot be cured, and (3) within 12 months after such
termination of the Merger Agreement, Georgetown Bancorp enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an acquisition proposal (whether or not the
same acquisition proposal as that referred to above).  For these purposes, all references in the definition of acquisition proposal in the Merger Agreement to “20%” shall instead refer to
“50%”.
 
Amendment, Waiver and Extension of the Merger Agreement
 

Subject to applicable law, Salem Five Bancorp and Georgetown Bancorp may amend the Merger Agreement by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors.
Such amendment must be in writing and signed by each of the parties to the Merger Agreement. However, after any approval of the Merger Agreement by Georgetown Bancorp’s
stockholders, there may not be, without further approval by Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders, any amendment of the Merger Agreement that requires further approval under applicable
law.
 

At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, each party, to the extent legally allowed, may extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other party; waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party; and waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements and conditions
contained in the Merger Agreement. Any such extension or waiver must be in writing and signed by the agreeing party. However, after any approval of the Merger Agreement by
Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders, there may not be, without further approval by Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders, any extension or waiver of the Merger Agreement that requires
further approval under applicable law.
 
Expenses and Fees
 

Except as set forth above regarding the termination fee, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will
be paid by the party incurring such expense.

PROPOSAL II — APPROVAL OF THE MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS
 

As required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K and Regulation 14A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Georgetown Bancorp is providing its stockholders
with the opportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the completion of the merger,
as disclosed in the section of this Proxy Statement captioned “Proposal I—Approval of the Merger Agreement—Financial Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Georgetown Bancorp’s Named Executive Officers” and the related table and narratives. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends
that stockholders vote “FOR” the Merger-Related Executive Compensation Proposal.
 

Your vote is requested. Georgetown Bancorp believes that the amount of compensation that may become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the
completion of the merger, as described in this proxy statement, is reasonable and demonstrates that Georgetown Bancorp’s executive compensation program was designed appropriately
and structured to ensure the retention of talented executives and a strong alignment with the long-term interests of Georgetown Bancorp’s stockholders. This vote is not intended to address
any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation that may become payable to the Georgetown Bancorp named executive officers in connection with the completion
of the merger. In addition, this vote is separate and independent from the vote of stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement. However, the compensation will not be payable in the
event the merger is not completed. Georgetown Bancorp asks that its stockholders vote “FOR” the following resolution:
 

RESOLVED, that the compensation that may become payable to Georgetown Bancorp’s named executive officers in connection with the completion of the merger, as disclosed
in the section captioned “Proposal I—Approval of the Merger Agreement—Financial Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Merger-Related Executive
Compensation for Georgetown Bancorp’s Named Executive Officers” and the related table and narratives, is hereby APPROVED.

 
This vote is advisory and, therefore, it will not be binding on Georgetown Bancorp, nor will it overrule any prior decision of Georgetown Bancorp or require Georgetown

Bancorp’s Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) to take any action. However, Georgetown Bancorp’s Board of Directors values the opinions of Georgetown Bancorp’s
stockholders, and to the extent that there is any significant vote against the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, Georgetown Bancorp’s Board of
Directors will consider stockholders’ concerns and will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. Georgetown Bancorp’s Board of Directors will consider the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast of Georgetown Bancorp common stock at the special meeting “FOR” the foregoing resolution as advisory approval of the compensation
that may become payable to Georgetown Bancorp’s named executive officers in connection with the completion of the merger.
 

PROPOSAL III — ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING
 

In the event that there are not sufficient votes to constitute a quorum or approve Proposal I at the time of the special meeting, the proposal may not be approved unless the special
meeting is adjourned to a later date or dates in order to permit further solicitation of proxies. In order to allow proxies that have been received by Georgetown Bancorp at the time of the
special meeting to be voted for an adjournment, if necessary, Georgetown Bancorp has submitted the question of adjournment to its stockholders as a separate matter for their
consideration. The special meeting may be postponed or adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that
stockholders vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal. If it is necessary to adjourn the special meeting, no notice of the adjourned special meeting is required to be given to stockholders
(unless a new record date is fixed), other than an announcement at the special meeting of the hour, date and place to which the special meeting is adjourned.
 

56

Table of Contents
 

Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting requires the approval of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting, in person or by proxy.
 

OTHER MATTERS
 

The Board of Directors is not aware of any business to come before the special meeting other than those matters described above in this proxy statement. However, if any other
matters should properly come before the special meeting, it is intended that proxies will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the person or persons voting the proxies.
 

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
 

The merger is expected to be consummated prior to the next regularly scheduled annual meeting of our stockholders, in which case the annual meeting would not be convened.
However, if the merger is not consummated prior to the next regularly scheduled annual meeting of our stockholders, any proposal which a stockholder wishes to have included in our
proxy materials for the next annual meeting of stockholders must have been received at Georgetown Bancorp’s executive office, 2 East Main Street, Georgetown, Massachusetts 01833, no
later than December 5, 2016. Any such proposals will be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted under the Exchange Act.
 

ADVANCE NOTICE OF BUSINESS TO BE CONDUCTED AT AN ANNUAL MEETING
 

Georgetown Bancorp’s bylaws provide an advance notice procedure for certain business, or nominations to the Board of Directors, to be brought before an annual meeting of
stockholders. In order for a stockholder to properly bring business before an annual meeting, or to propose a nominee to the board of directors, Georgetown Bancorp’s Secretary must
receive written notice not earlier than the 90th day nor later than the 80th day prior to date of the annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than 90 days’ notice or prior
public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting is provided to stockholders, then, to be timely, notice by the stockholder must be so received not later than the tenth day following the
day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.
 



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1542299/000110465917000182/a16-21651_1defm14a.htm

The notice with respect to director nominations must include (1) as to each individual whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director, (A) all information
relating to such person that would indicate such person’s qualification under Article 2, Section 12 of Georgetown Bancorp’s bylaws, including an affidavit that such person would not be
disqualified under the provisions of Article 2, Section 12 of the bylaws and (B) all other information relating to such individual that is required to be disclosed in connection with
solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any
successor rule or regulation; and (2) as to the stockholder giving the notice, (A) the name and address of such stockholder as they appear on Georgetown Bancorp’s books and of the
beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made; (B) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of Georgetown Bancorp which are owned beneficially or of
record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner; (C) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and each proposed nominee and any other person
or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made by such stockholder; (D) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by
proxy at the meeting to nominate the persons named in its notice; and (E) any other information relating to such stockholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or
other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any
successor rule or regulation. Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.
 

The merger is expected to be consummated prior to the next regularly scheduled annual meeting of our stockholders, in which case the annual meeting would not be convened.
However, if the merger is not consummated prior to the next regularly scheduled annual meeting of our stockholders, the scheduled date on which the next annual meeting is to be held is
May 15, 2017. Advance written notice for certain business, or nominations to the

 
57

Table of Contents
 

Board of Directors, to be brought before the next annual meeting must be given to us no earlier than February 15, 2017 and no later than February 25, 2017.  If notice is received before
February 15, 2017 or after February 25, 2017, it will be considered untimely, and we will not be required to present the matter at the annual meeting.

W I T N E S S E T H:
 

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of Parent, and the Boards of Directors of Merger Sub and the Company have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
companies and the Boards of Directors of Merger Sub and the Company have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective constituents to consummate the strategic business
combination transactions provided for herein, pursuant to which Merger Sub will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), so
that the Company is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the “Surviving Corporation”);
 

WHEREAS, immediately following the Merger, Georgetown Bank (“GB”) will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Bank Merger Agreement (as
defined below), merge with and into Salem Five Cents Savings Bank (“SFCSB”) (the “Bank Merger”), so that SFCSB is the surviving bank in the Bank Merger;
 

WHEREAS, immediately following the Bank Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall dissolve and liquidate into Parent;
 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent is entering into Voting and Support Agreements with certain directors and executive officers of the
Company, in each case in the form agreed to by the parties; and
 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.
 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
agree as follows:
 

ARTICLE I
THE MERGER

 
Section 1.1                                    The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”), at the Effective

Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company. The Company shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the
State of

Table of Contents
 
Maryland. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.
 

Section 1.2                                    Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place at 10:00 a.m. Boston time at the offices
of K&L Gates LLP, on a date which shall be no later than five (5) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth
in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless extended by mutual
agreement of the parties (the “Closing Date”).
 

Section 1.3                                    Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the certificate of merger to be filed with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and
Taxation (the “Maryland Department”) on the Closing Date (the “Certificate of Merger”). The term “Effective Time” shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set
forth in the Certificate of Merger.
 

Section 1.4                                    Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the MGCL.
 

Section 1.5                                    Conversion of Company Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder of any of the following securities:
 

(a)                                 Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Company
Stock”), except for shares of Company Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock, or owned by any Subsidiary of the Company), shall be converted into the right to receive
$26.00 in cash without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).

 
(b)                                 All of the shares of Company Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and

shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a “Certificate”, it being understood that any reference herein to
“Certificate” shall be deemed to include as applicable (and as reasonably interpreted by Parent) reference to book-entry account arrangements for the ownership of shares of
Company Stock) previously representing any such shares of Company Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Certificates previously
representing shares of Company Stock shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2. If, prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities
as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares,
or any stock dividend or

stock distribution with a record date during such period, merger or other similar change in capitalization (not including, for the avoidance of doubt, for any such change in the
number of outstanding shares of Company Stock as a result of exercises of Company Stock Options, in accordance with their terms), the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change; provided that nothing in this Section 1.5(b) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 
(c)                                  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury

stock or owned by any Subsidiary of the Company shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
 

Section 1.6                                    Merger Sub Common Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Merger Sub Common Stock”) shall be converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.
 

Section 1.7                                    Treatment of Company Equity Awards.
 

(a)                                 At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Stock under the Company’s 2009 Equity Incentive Plan and the
Company’s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Company Stock Plans”) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company
Stock Option”), whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall entitle the holder of such
Company Stock Option to receive (without interest), at the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of
Company Stock of such Company Stock Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock
Option which has an exercise price per share of Company Stock that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no
consideration or payment.

 
(b)                                 At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock award (a “Company RSA”) under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall,

automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall entitle the holder of such Company RSA to receive (without interest), at the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company RSA immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(B) the Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Stock Options, and Company RSAs
(collectively, the “Company Equity Awards”) pursuant to this Section 1.7. The Company shall take all reasonable actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective
Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Equity Awards.

Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law.
 

Section 1.10                             Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. The directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and

(30) days after the date of this Agreement, SFCSB and GB shall enter into the agreement and plan of merger in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Bank Merger Agreement”) and
(a) the Company shall cause the Bank Merger Agreement to be duly authorized, executed and delivered by GB and (b) Parent shall cause the Bank Merger Agreement to be duly
authorized, executed and delivered by SFCSB. The Company shall cause GB, and Parent shall cause SFCSB, to execute such certificates of merger and articles of combination and such
other documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (“Bank Merger Certificates”) immediately following the Merger. Within thirty (30) days after the date
hereof, (i) the Company, in its capacity as sole stockholder of GB, shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement and the Bank Merger and (ii) Parent, in its capacity as sole stockholder of
SFCSB, shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement and the Bank Merger.

revise the structure of the transaction described in Article I, provided that (a) there are no adverse federal or
 

A-4

Table of Contents
 
state income tax consequences to the Company and its stockholders as a result of the modification; (b) the consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Stock, Company Stock
Options and Company RSAs under this Agreement is not thereby changed in kind or value or reduced in amount; (c) there are no adverse changes to the benefits and other arrangements
provided to or on behalf of the Company’s directors, officers and other employees; and (d) such modification will not delay materially or jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory
approvals or non-objection of Governmental Entities. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company agree to amend this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement and any related documents
appropriately in order to reflect any such revised structure.
 

ARTICLE II
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENT OF COMPANY EQUITY AWARDS

 
Section 2.1                                    Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available. No later than one (1) business day prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be

deposited, with an exchange agent designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (the “Exchange Fund”), to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Stock.
 

Section 2.2                                    Delivery of Merger Consideration.



8/28/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1542299/000110465917000182/a16-21651_1defm14a.htm

(a)                                 As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each

holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares of Company Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration, as applicable. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check representing the amount of the
Merger Consideration and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable to holders of
Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive,
upon surrender, the Merger Consideration, as applicable.

 
(b)                                 In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing Company Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, the

proper amount of cash shall be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
 

A-5

Table of Contents
 

surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish
to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 
(c)                                  After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Stock that were issued and

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures in this Article II.

 
(d)                                 Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid to

Parent. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Certificate or Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 
(e)                                  Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration or any other consideration

otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Stock, as applicable, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be,
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 
(f)                                   In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be

lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.3                                    Payment of Company Equity Awards. At the Effective Time, Parent or Company shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of a Company Equity Award the
amounts to which such holder is entitled as determined in accordance with Sections 1.7(a), and 1.7(b).
 

ARTICLE III
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

 
Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent concurrently herewith (the “Company Disclosure Schedule”); provided, that (i) no such

item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect,
(ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company that such item
represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) any disclosures made
with respect to a section of this Article III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article III specifically referenced or cross-referenced therein and (2) other sections of
this Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) to a reader unfamiliar with the Company’s business from
reading only the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections, or (b) as disclosed in any Company Reports filed by the Company after January 1, 2015 and prior to the date
hereof (but disregarding any disclosures contained under the heading “Risk Factors,” or disclosures of risks set forth in any “forward-looking statements” disclaimer or any other
statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:
 

Section 3.1                                    Corporate Organization.
 

(a)                                 The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland, is a savings and loan holding
company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act of 1933 (the “HOLA”) and is duly registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
“Federal Reserve Board”). The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term “Material Adverse Effect” means, with
respect to Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, any event, occurrence, fact, condition or change that is, or could reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of such party and its Subsidiaries (provided,
that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall

not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or applicable regulatory accounting
requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in Laws of general applicability to companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations
thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in general economic or capital market conditions affecting financial institutions or their holding
companies, including, but not limited to, changes in general interest rates, (D) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions (including the
outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries,
(E) public disclosure of the execution of this Agreement, public disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any effect on a party’s
relationships with its customers or employees) or actions expressly required by this Agreement (excluding the obligations with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
operating in the ordinary course of business) in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that, for purposes of Section 3.3(b) and
Section 7.2(a) (to the extent relating to Section 3.3(b)), the exceptions set forth in this clause (E) shall not apply in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has
occurred), or (F) the reasonable and customary expenses incurred by the Company or Parent in negotiating, documenting, effecting and consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; except, with respect to subclause (A), (B), (C) or (D), to the extent that the effects of such change are disproportionately adverse to the business,
properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of such party and its Subsidiaries as compared to other companies in the industry in which
such party and its Subsidiaries operate), or (ii) the ability of such party or any Subsidiary of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in
this Agreement, the word “Subsidiary” shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Section 10(a)(1)(G) of HOLA. True and complete copies of the articles of incorporation of the
Company (the “Company Articles”) and the amended and restated bylaws of the Company (the “Company Bylaws”), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available by the Company to Parent, and the Company is not in violation of the Company Articles and Company Bylaws.

 
(b)                                 Each Subsidiary of the Company (a “Company Subsidiary”) (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is

duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable Law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its
ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any Company Subsidiary to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of a
Company Subsidiary that is a regulated

whatsoever (“Liens”), and all of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights,
with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of any
Company Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of any Company Subsidiary.

attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

or required to be contributed to, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of any current or former employee, consultant, officer or director of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and with respect to which any ongoing obligation exists or any potential liability is borne by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 
(b)                                 The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true and complete copies of (i) each Company Benefit Plan, including any amendments thereto, and

(the “Company Qualified Plans”). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each Company Qualified Plan and the related trust, and there are no existing
circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Company Qualified Plan or the related trust.

investigations, audits (other than routine audits by a Governmental Entity), proceedings or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to the Company’s knowledge, no
set of circumstances exists that may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim, lawsuit, investigation, audit (other than a routine audit by a Governmental Entity), proceeding
or arbitration against the Company Benefit Plans, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

 
(i)                                     Except as set forth in Section 3.11(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the

transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of, cause the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any material benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other
benefit to any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend,

comply with applicable Law.

shall be deemed to require Parent or permit the Company to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction that would (i) reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby (but measured on a scale
relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole as of the date hereof), (ii) cause Parent to lose, suffer any material diminution in or have otherwise materially and
adversely modified or impaired any of its legislative or regulatory rights, statuses or privileges or have an adverse effect on the regulatory exemptions available to Parent due to

made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 
(e)                                  To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any

Governmental Entity pertaining to the Merger whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party
to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed. As
used in this Agreement, “Requisite Regulatory Approvals” shall mean all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders or approvals from the FDIC, OCC, the Federal Reserve
Board, the Commissioner, the Massachusetts BBI, MHPF, DIF and the New Hampshire Banking Department.

securities Laws or federal or state banking Laws (other than reports or documents that the Company is not permitted to disclose under applicable Law), and (ii) all other
information concerning the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or
control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any
Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, or be related to discussions by the Board of Directors or any of its committees relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

of the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of the Company the Requisite Company Vote, including by communicating to its stockholders
its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Proxy Statement) that they approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the “Company
Recommendation”). The Company may engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Parent to assist in the solicitation of proxies from stockholders relating to the Requisite
Company Vote. However, subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of the Company, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend this
Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company may submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the
Company without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of
Directors of the Company may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement
thereto to the extent required by Law; provided, that the Board of Directors of the Company may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i)(A) the Company has received
an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 6.9 (and such proposal is not withdrawn) and the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as
defined below) or (B) an Intervening Event shall have occurred and the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that continuing to recommend this Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, (ii) the Company gives Parent at least five (5) business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including (A) in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity
of the third party making, any such Acquisition Proposal and any amendment or modification thereof or (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the nature of the Intervening
Event in reasonable detail) and (iii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement
proposed by Parent (which shall be negotiated in good faith by the Company) and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend this Agreement, as
modified or amended. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a

new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3(a) and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3(a). The Company shall adjourn or postpone the
Company Meeting if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote. For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to the immediately preceding sentence, unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Meeting for the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby as provided for in this Agreement and nothing herein shall be
deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation. Except as set forth in this Section 6.3(a), the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (I) withdraw, change, qualify or
modify or publicly and affirmatively propose to withdraw, change, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation, (II) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender
offer or exchange offer for Company Stock within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such offer or (III) approve, resolve, adopt or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve, resolve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clauses (I) through (III) being referred to as a “Change in Company
Recommendation”).

 
(b)                                 For purposes of this Agreement, an “Intervening Event” means any event, change, effect, development or occurrence occurring or arising after the date of this

Agreement that (i) was not known, or reasonably foreseeable, to the Board of Directors of the Company as of or prior to the date of this Agreement and did not result from a
breach of this Agreement by the Company and (ii) does not relate to or involve an Acquisition Proposal.

 
Section 6.4                                    Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries

to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal and regulatory requirements that may be
imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b)                                 Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the consummation of the Merger, (i) the Company and GB shall each terminate their

respective employment agreements with Robert E. Balletto and Joseph W. Kennedy, and (ii) GB shall terminate the change in control agreements with Frederick H. Weismann,
Pamela H. Kentley, Sharon E. Plante, and James T. Allen, in each case in exchange for a payment, with respect to Messrs. Balletto and Kennedy, calculated and paid in the
manner set forth in Section 6.5(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and with respect to Frederick H. Weismann, Pamela H. Kentley, Sharon E. Plante, and James T. Allen,
calculated in the manner set forth in Section 3(a) of each executive’s change in control agreement.  In exchange for such payment, each of Messrs. Balletto and Kennedy and
Frederick H. Weismann, Pamela H. Kentley, Sharon E. Plante, and James T. Allen shall enter into a release of claims against the Company and GB, effective immediately prior to
the Effective Time, containing the material terms set forth in Section 6.5(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (“General Release”).  Contemporaneously with the execution
of this Agreement, Parent shall enter into employment agreements with each of Messrs. Balletto and Kennedy that shall be effective as of the Effective Time, which executed
agreements are set forth in Section 6.5(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

 
(c)                                  Parent shall offer or cause to be offered to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries

(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) immediately following the Effective Time (collectively, the “Continuing Employees”) with employee benefits (other
than equity-based compensation) comparable to those provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Nothing set forth in this Section 6.5(c) shall create
a contract of employment with or for the benefit of any employee, or change such employee’s status as an employee at-will.

 
(d)                                 In the event of termination of any Company Benefit Plan which is a health plan or consolidation of any such plan with any New Plan that is also a health plan,

Parent, or its applicable Subsidiary, shall make available to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents health coverage on the same basis as it provides such coverage to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage under a Company Benefit Plan which is a health
plan prior to the time that such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in a New Plan which is a comparable health plan, no coverage of any of the Continuing
Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any such Company Benefit Plan prior to the time such Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible to
participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to employees of the Company and SFCSB. With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”),

Parent shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions, evidence of insurability (other than with respect to life insurance), and waiting periods with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or
waiting periods would apply under the most closely analogous Company Benefit Plan or to the extent prohibited under the applicable New Plan; (ii) assume all obligations to
provide continued health coverage in accordance with Section 4980B of the Code and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA to the qualified beneficiaries of Continuing Employees;
and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into
account under the most closely analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; provided, that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it
would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension or the employer premium subsidy
under any retiree medical plan, or (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or that provides benefits to a grandfathered employee population.

 
(e)                                  Any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary who is not a party to an employment, change in control, termination or severance agreement and who is not

eligible for and entitled to severance under any other severance plan or program maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, who is not offered employment
with Parent or one of its Subsidiaries or whose employment is terminated by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (other than for cause) within one year of the Effective Date;
shall receive a cash payment equal to two (2) weeks of such employee’s current base salary (or average hourly wage over a two (2) week period) for each year of service with the

(f)                                   Parent and the Company shall each, and shall cause each of their respective affiliates to, comply with all Laws regarding the maintenance, use, sharing and
processing of Employee Personal Data, including (i) compliance with any applicable legal requirements to provide notice to, or obtain consent from, the employee for processing
of the data and (ii) taking any other steps necessary to ensure compliance with applicable data protection Laws. “Employee Personal Data”“ means any information relating to the

terminate, in accordance with all applicable Laws, effective on the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date, with such termination being contingent on the Closing.
Such resolutions shall be subject to Parent’s reasonable prior review and approval. Unless Parent makes the request set forth in this Section, Parent shall or shall cause SFCSB to
take such action, if any, required to ensure that Continuing Employees who have satisfied the eligibility requirements of Parent’s or SFCSB’s 401(k) plan as of the Effective Time
(after giving credit for service with Company and GB, as required by Section 6.5(d) hereof) shall be eligible to enter such Parent or SFCSB 401(k) plan as of the Effective Time.
If Parent or SFCSB terminate or freeze the Company 401(k) Plan following the Effective Time, Parent or SFCSB shall ensure that Continuing Employees who have satisfied the
eligibility requirements as of the date of such termination or freeze (after giving credit for service with Company and GB, as required by Section 6.5(d) hereof) shall be eligible to
enter such Parent or SFCSB 401(k) plan as of the effective date of such termination or freeze.

 
(h)                                 Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, SFCSB and GB shall take all actions, including through resolutions of the SFCSB Board of Directors

(or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof or other appropriate governing body) and the GB Board of Directors (or a duly constituted and authorized committee
thereof or other appropriate governing body), respectively, that may be necessary or appropriate to cause the Supplemental Retirement Plan for Senior Executives, as adopted by
Georgetown Savings Bank effective June 30, 2008 (the “SERP”), to terminate, in accordance with all applicable Laws, effective immediately upon the Closing, with such
termination being contingent on the Closing. Any resolutions of the GB Board of Directors (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof or other appropriate
governing body) pursuant to this provision shall be subject to Parent’s reasonable prior review and approval. Subject to each participant executing a General Release, amounts
owed to participants under the SERP shall be paid as set forth in Section 6.5(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 
(i)                                     If requested by Parent not later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions, including through resolutions of the

Company’s Board of Directors (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof or other appropriate governing body) that may be necessary or appropriate to cause each
Company Benefit Plan requested by Parent, to terminate, in accordance with all applicable Laws, effective on the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date, with
such termination being contingent on the Closing. Such resolutions shall be subject to Parent’s reasonable prior review and approval.

 
(j)                                    Prior to making any written broad-based communications to the employees of the Company of its Subsidiaries with respect to employment, compensation or

benefits matters addressed in this Agreement or related, directly or indirectly, to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (excluding any communications relating to
ordinary course employment, compensation or benefits matters unrelated thereto), the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall
have a reasonable period of

time to review and comment on the communication, and the Company shall consider Parent’s comments in good faith.
 

(k)                                 Parent shall establish a retention bonus pool of up to $300,000 to induce retention of Key Employees of the Company and GB after the Effective Time. 
Allocation of the retention bonuses shall be jointly determined by the Chief Executive Officers of SFCSB and GB.  Neither party shall communicate the amounts considered for
individual bonuses with the affected employees until such amounts are finally determined.

 
(l)                                     Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to

continue in the employ or service of the Parent, the Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify
any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.11. Except for the provisions of Section 6.6 below, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever (including the creation of any third-party beneficiary rights) under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 
Section 6.6                                    Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.

 
(a)                                 For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each

present and former director or officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the “Company Indemnified Parties”) against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and the

Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; provided, that the Company Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification. Parent and the Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company Indemnified Party, and the Company Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent and the Parent, in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(b)                                 The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a three (3)-year “tail” policy under the Company’s existing directors
and officers insurance policy providing coverage equivalent to the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof
if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the an amount in excess of 175% of the current annual premium paid as of
the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”). If the Company purchases such a “tail policy,” Parent shall maintain such “tail policy” in full force and
effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.  If Company is unable to obtain such policy, for a period of three (3) years after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided, that the Parent may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims against the present and former officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time
(including the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, that the Parent shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis,
the Premium Cap, and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Parent shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which,
in the Parent’s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.

 
(c)                                  Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.6, upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation

described above, will promptly notify the Parent; provided, that failure to so notify will not affect the obligations of the Parent under this Section 6.6 unless and to the extent that
the Parent is actually and materially prejudiced as a consequence.

 
(d)                                 The obligations of the Parent and the Company under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a manner so as to

adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.6 without the prior written consent of the affected Company
Indemnified Party or affected person.

(e)                                  The provisions of this Section 6.6 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company

Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Parent or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate with or merge into any other entity and not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of its assets or liabilities to any other entity or engage in any similar transaction,
then in each case to the extent the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6 are not otherwise transferred and assumed by such successors and assigns by operation of law or
otherwise, the Parent will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Parent will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.
 
Section 6.7                                    Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement to

vest the Surviving Corporation or its assignee with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and
directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

 
Section 6.8                                    Advice of Changes. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand (in such capacity, the “Notifying Party”), shall promptly advise the other party

of any change or event (a) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Notifying Party or (b) which the Notifying Party believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a breach of any of the Notifying Party’s representations, warranties or covenants contained herein.  From time to time prior to the Effective Time
(and on the date prior to the Closing Date), each party will supplement or amend its Disclosure Schedules delivered in connection with the execution of this Agreement to reflect any
matter which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure Schedules or which is necessary to
correct any information in such Disclosure Schedules which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such Disclosure Schedules shall have any effect for the
purpose of determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties contained in Article III and Article IV in order to determine the fulfillment of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a) hereof, as the case may be, or the compliance by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, with the respective covenants and agreements of such
parties contained herein.

 
Section 6.9                                    Acquisition Proposals.

 
(a)                                 The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively,

“Representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or

 
A-51

participate in any discussions with, any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify a person that makes any inquiry with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, of
the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.9(a); provided, that, prior to the approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company by the Requisite Company Vote,
in the event the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement (which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach
of this Section 6.9) and its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of
Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that failure to take such actions
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, further, that, prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to
the foregoing proviso, (A) the Company shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality
Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and (B) any non-public information to be
provided to such third party shall have been previously provided to Parent. The Company will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
the Company shall promptly request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any such other person. The Company will promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent orally, and within two (2) business days, in writing, of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions thereof, and the identity of the person
making such inquiry), and will keep Parent reasonably apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any amendments to or
revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. The Company shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to on its behalf,
enter into any binding acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other definitive transaction agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in
accordance with this Section 6.9(a)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal. As used in this Agreement, “Acquisition Proposal” shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any offer or proposal relating to any third party indication of interest in, (I) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 20% or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or

a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of the
Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of the Company, or (III) a merger,

of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of the Company.

 
(b)                                 As used in this Agreement, “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (substituting “50%” for “20%” in the definition

thereof) which the Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors, taking into account all relevant legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such offer or proposal and the person making the proposal, that, (i) if consummated, would be more favorable to the holders of Company Stock,
from a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any proposed revisions to the terms of this Agreement) and (ii) is
more likely than not to be completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis.

 
(c)                                  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act

or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any legally required disclosure to the Company’s stockholders; provided, that such
Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.
 
Section 6.10                             Public Announcements. The Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan to ensure that all press

releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan and, except as required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical,
otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 
Section 6.11                             Takeover Statutes. None of the Company, Parent or their respective Boards of Directors or Trustees shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute

to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant

such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated

Section 6.13                             Stock Exchange Delisting. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all

“NASDAQ”) to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Stock from the NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Company Stock under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 
Section 6.14                             Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall cooperate and consult with Parent in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company

and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall afford Parent the opportunity to participate at their own expense in the defense or
settlement of any such litigation, and no such settlement shall be offered or agreed to without Parent’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 
Section 6.15                             Transition. Commencing following the date hereof, and in all cases subject to applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate

with Parent and its Subsidiaries to facilitate the integration of the parties and their respective businesses effective as of the Closing Date or such later date as may be determined by Parent.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date hereof through the Closing Date and consistent with the performance of their day-to-day operations and the continuous
operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, the Company shall cause the employees, officers and representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries
to use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide support, including support from its outside contractors and vendors, as well as data and records access, and take actions and assist
Parent in performing all tasks, including conversion planning, assisting in any post-closing divestiture, post-closing equipment installation, training, the provision of customer
communications and notices (including joint communications and notices relating to anticipated account changes, branch closures, divestiture and/or systems conversion), and other
matters reasonably required to result in a successful transition and integration at the Closing or such later date as may be determined by Parent. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession
or control of such information

or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement,  or be related to discussions by the Board of Directors or any of its

control or direct the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

 
Section 6.16                             Employee Cooperation. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) assist Parent in

identifying key employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (such employees as are so identified by Parent, “Key Employees”), including providing any information as reasonably
requested by Parent about individual employees and groups of employees with respect to their roles, job descriptions, performance, compensation levels, and other similar information,
(b) to the extent requested by Parent, cooperate in good faith with Parent to help establish and implement, on behalf of Parent, any employee retention and transition incentive programs
designed to encourage the retention and performance of Key Employees and (c) ensure that no executive officer of, or written communication by, the Company or its Subsidiaries
disparages Parent or any of its affiliates in any way or interferes with Parent’s retention efforts with respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 
Section 6.17                             ESOP Matters. The Trustee and the Company shall take or cause to be taken all such actions as may be necessary to effect the actions set forth below relating to

the ESOP prior to or simultaneous with the Closing, as applicable:
 

(a)                                 Upon the Closing, the ESOP shall be terminated and all ESOP participants’ accounts shall be fully vested and 100% non-forfeitable.  The Company shall cause
the Plan Administrator (as defined in the ESOP) to direct the Trustee to sell a sufficient amount of the Suspense Shares to repay the outstanding ESOP Loan in full, and the
proceeds of the sale of the Suspense Shares shall be used to repay the outstanding balance of the ESOP Loan.  If any proceeds from the sale of the Suspense Shares remain after
the outstanding balance of the ESOP Loan is repaid in full, the remaining proceeds shall be deemed to be earnings and shall be allocated to ESOP participants’ accounts in

accordance with Section 8.1 of the ESOP.  If the proceeds of the sale of the Suspense Shares are insufficient to repay the outstanding balance of the ESOP Loan in full, the
Company shall forgive the remaining balance of the ESOP Loan (after application of the proceeds of the sale of the Suspense Shares).  The Company acknowledges and agrees
that following the Company’s forgiveness of the remaining balance on the ESOP Loan the ESOP shall have no further obligation to the Company with respect to the ESOP Loan,
and the Company shall have no recourse against the ESOP for any amounts then remaining due under the ESOP Loan.

of the Company:

(a)                                 by the mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument, if the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

 
(b)                                 by Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger, the Bank Merger

and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order permanently enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger, the Bank Merger; provided that if the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to
the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein, such party shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b);

 
(c)                                  by Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the fifteenth (15th) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the

“Termination Date”); provided that if the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein such party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c);

 
(d)                                 by Parent or the Company (provided, that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement

contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall
cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of a termination by the
Company, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be
true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Section 7.3, in
the case of a termination by the Company, and which is not cured within thirty (30) days (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date) following written notice to
the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period;

Vote shall not have been obtained;

 
(f)                                   by Parent prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (A) failed to recommend in the

Proxy Statement that the stockholders of the Company approve this Agreement, (B) effected a Change in Company Recommendation, (C) failed to issue a press release
announcing its opposition to an Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) business days after such Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced or (D) submitted this Agreement to the
holders of Company Stock for approval without a recommendation for approval or (ii) the Company or its Board of Directors has breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or
Section 6.9 in any material respect;

 
(g)                                  by Parent, if the Federal Reserve Board or the OCC has granted a Requisite Regulatory Approval but such Requisite Regulatory Approval contains or would

result in the imposition of a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition and there is no meaningful possibility that such Requisite Regulatory Approval could be revised prior
to the Termination Date so as not to contain or result in a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition; provided that if (i) Parent does not elect to terminate this Agreement
within 60 days following any such termination right arising under this Section 8.1(g) and (ii) Parent has not by the end of such 60 day period waived the Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition with respect to which such termination right arose, then the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g); provided, further, that,
if during the 60 day period referred to in the preceding proviso any new material condition or restriction is imposed by a Governmental Entity (regardless of whether such new
condition or restriction would itself constitute a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition) such 60 day period shall be extended until 60 days after such new condition or
restriction was imposed with there being no meaningful possibility that such new condition or restriction would be revised prior to the Termination Date so as not to be a material
condition or restriction; or

 
(h)                                 by Parent or the Company if the Federal Reserve Board or the OCC shall have requested in writing that the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates

withdraw (other than for technical reasons), and not be permitted to resubmit within 60 days, any application with respect to a Requisite Regulatory Approval.

Superior Proposal and the Company complies with Section 8.2(b) below.

 
The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) or (i) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination to the other party in
accordance with Section 9.5, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

(a)                                 In the event of termination of this Agreement by Parent or the Company as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no

effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their respective affiliates or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever
hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b), this Section 8.2 and Article IX (provided that in such event Section 9.12
shall, for the avoidance of doubt, survive only with respect to the other surviving provisions) shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or its
willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement (which, in the case of the Company, shall include the loss to the holders of Company Stock of the economic
benefits of the Merger, including the loss of the premium offered to the holders of Company Stock, it being understood that the Company shall be entitled to pursue damages for
such losses and to enforce the right to recover such losses on behalf of its stockholders in its sole and absolute discretion, and any amounts received by the Company in
connection therewith may be retained by the Company).

 
(b)                                 In the event that:

 
(i)                                     (A) prior to the Effective Time and after the date hereof, any person shall have made an Acquisition Proposal, which proposal has been publicly

disclosed or made known to management of Company or its stockholders generally, or any person shall have publicly announced or made known to management of
Company an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to
Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained or Section 8.1(e), or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d) and (C) within twelve (12) months
after the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether
or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above); provided that, for purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(i), all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to “20%” shall instead refer to “50%”; or

 
(ii)                                  this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(i);

then the Company shall pay Parent a fee, in immediately available funds, in the amount of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (the “Termination Fee”) upon, in the case of
Section 8.2(b)(i), the earlier of the date it enters into the applicable definitive agreement and the date of the consummation of such transaction, and in the case of Section 8.2(b)
(ii), as promptly as practicable after (and in any event within two (2) business days of) the termination of this

Agreement. In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay Parent the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 
(c)                                  The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this

Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. The amounts payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) constitute
liquidated damages and not a penalty and, except in the case of fraud or a willful and knowing breach, shall be the sole monetary remedy in a circumstance where the Termination
Fee is payable and is paid in full. In the event that the Company fails to pay when due any amounts payable under Section 8.2(b), then the Company shall (i) reimburse Parent for
all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and (ii) pay Parent interest on
such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is
actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to be made.

Merger, dated as of October 5, 2016 (as amended from time to time, the “Parent Merger Agreement”), which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, provides for the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “Parent Merger”), with the Company as the surviving company in the Parent Merger;
 
WHEREAS, contingent upon, and immediately following the time at which the Parent Merger becomes effective, on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement,
the parties to this Agreement intend to effect the merger of GB with and into SFCSB, with SFCSB surviving the merger (the “Bank Merger”); and
 
WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of SFCSB and GB have each determined that the Bank Merger is desirable and in the best interests of their respective banks, and have unanimously

property, franchises, and interests, including appointments, designations, and nominations, and all other rights and interests as trustee, executor, administrator, registrar of stocks and
bonds, guardian of estates, assignee, and receiver, and in every other fiduciary capacity, in the same manner and to the same extent as such rights, franchises, and interests were held or

Massachusetts Division of Banks and Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The date and time so specified shall be immediately following the effective time of the
Merger when all of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the Bank Merger specified in this Agreement shall have been satisfied or duly waived by the party entitled to
satisfaction thereof (such date and time of the Bank Merger being herein referred to as the “Effective Time”).
 

1.3                               Charter and Bylaws. The charter and bylaws of SFCSB in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the charter and the bylaws of the Surviving Bank, in

1.6                               Tax Treatment. It is the intention of the parties that the Bank Merger be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a “reorganization” pursuant to Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 

1.7                               GB Liquidation Account.  From and after the Effective Time, depositors of GB who become depositors of SFCSB shall have the same rights of all other depositors of
SCFSB, including rights to any distributions upon liquidation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, SCFSB shall, to the extent required by law, assume the liquidation account established by
GB in connection with the second step conversion of GB’s former mutual holding company, as such liquidation account shall be in effect as of the Effective Time.
 

ARTICLE 2
CONSIDERATION

 
2.1                               Effect on GB Capital Stock. By virtue of the Bank Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of SFCSB, at the Effective Time, all

into by and among Georgetown, Salem Five and Merger Sub (the “Agreement”). Pursuant to the Agreement and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth
therein, at the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Salem Five, Merger Sub, Georgetown, or the
holders of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Georgetown (the “Georgetown Common Stock”), each share of Georgetown Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time  (except for shares owned by Georgetown as treasury stock or owned by any subsidiary of Georgetown) will be
converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash without interest (the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the
Agreement.
 

The Agreement further provides that, immediately following the Merger, Georgetown Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Georgetown (“Georgetown Bank”),
will merge with and into Salem Five Cents Savings Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Salem Five (“Salem Five Bank”), with Salem Five Bank being the surviving
bank (the “Bank Merger”), pursuant to a separate agreement and plan of merger.
 

KBW has acted as financial advisor to Georgetown and not as an advisor to or agent of any other person. As part of our investment banking business, we are
continually engaged in the valuation of bank and bank holding company securities in connection with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of
listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, we have experience in,
and knowledge of, the valuation of banking enterprises.  In the ordinary course of their broker-dealer businesses and pursuant to certain existing sales and trading
relationships, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time purchase securities from, and sell securities to, Georgetown and Salem Five, and as market makers in
securities, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time have a long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of Georgetown for its and their own
accounts and for the accounts of its and their respective customers and clients. We have acted exclusively for the board of directors of Georgetown (the “Board”) in
rendering this opinion and will receive a fee from Georgetown for our services.  A portion of our fee is payable upon the rendering of this opinion, and a significant
portion is contingent upon the successful completion of the Merger. In addition, Georgetown has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our
engagement.

Other than in connection with this present engagement, in the past two years KBW has not provided investment banking and financial advisory services to
Georgetown. In the past two years, KBW has not provided investment banking and financial advisory services to Salem Five. We may in the future provide investment
banking and financial advisory services to Georgetown or Salem Five and receive compensation for such services.
 

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating condition of Georgetown and
bearing upon the Merger, including among other things, the following: (i) a draft of the Agreement dated October 4, 2016 (the most recent draft made available to us);
(ii) the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 of Georgetown; (iii) the unaudited
quarterly financial statements and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 of Georgetown; (iv) certain
regulatory filings of Georgetown and Georgetown Bank, including (as applicable) the semi-annual reports on Form FR Y-9SP and quarterly reports on Form FR Y-9C and
quarterly call reports required to be filed with respect to each semi-annual period and quarter (as the case may be) during the three year period ended December 31, 2015,
to the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and to the semi-annual period and quarter ended June 30, 2016; (v) certain other interim reports and other communications of
Georgetown to its shareholders; and (vi) other financial information concerning the business and operations of Georgetown and Salem Five that was furnished to us by
Georgetown or Salem Five or that we were otherwise directed to use for purposes of our analyses.  Our consideration of financial information and other factors that we
deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to our analyses included, among others, the following:  (i) the historical and current financial position and results
of operations of Georgetown; (ii) the assets and liabilities of Georgetown; (iii) the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the
banking industry; (iv) a comparison of certain financial and stock market information for Georgetown with similar information for certain other companies the securities
of which are publicly traded; and (v) financial and operating forecasts and projections of Georgetown that were prepared by, and provided to us and discussed with us by,
Georgetown management and that were used and relied upon by us at the direction of such management and with the consent of the Board. We have also performed such
other studies and analyses as we considered appropriate and have taken into account our assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and our
experience in other transactions, as well as our experience in securities valuation and knowledge of the banking industry generally. We have also participated in
discussions that were held with the respective managements of Georgetown and Salem Five regarding the past and current business operations, regulatory relations,
financial condition and future prospects of their respective companies and such other matters as we have deemed relevant to our inquiry.  In addition, we have considered
the results of the efforts undertaken by or on behalf of Georgetown, with our assistance, to solicit indications of interest from third parties regarding a potential transaction
with Georgetown.
 

In conducting our review and arriving at our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other
information that was provided to us or that was publicly available and we have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of any such information or
assumed any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or completeness. We have relied upon the management of Georgetown as to the reasonableness and
achievability of the financial and operating forecasts and projections of Georgetown referred to above (and the assumptions and bases therefor) that were prepared by, and
provided to us and discussed with us by, such management and we have assumed that such forecasts and projections were reasonably prepared on a bases reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments of such management and that such forecasts and projections will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods
currently estimated by such management.

It is understood that the forecasts, projections and estimates provided to us and used and relied upon by us were not prepared with the expectation of public
disclosure, that all such information is based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, including, without limitation, factors related to general
economic and competitive conditions and that, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in such forecasts, projections and estimates. We
have assumed, based on discussions with the management of Georgetown and with the consent of Georgetown, that the forecasts, estimates and projections of
Georgetown that were prepared and provided to us by Georgetown management provide a reasonable basis upon which we could form our opinion and we express no
view as to any such information or the assumptions or bases therefor. We have relied on all such information without independent verification or analysis and do not in
any respect assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof.
 

We also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of Georgetown since
the date of the last financial statements that were made available to us. We are not experts in the independent verification of the adequacy of allowances for loan and lease
losses and we have assumed, without independent verification and with your consent, that the aggregate allowances for loan and lease losses for Georgetown are adequate
to cover such losses.  In rendering our opinion, we have not made or obtained any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities
(contingent or otherwise) of Georgetown or Salem Five, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor have we
examined any individual loan or credit files, nor did we evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of Georgetown or Salem Five under any state or federal
laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters. Estimates of values of companies and assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect
the prices at which companies or assets may actually be sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, we assume no responsibility or liability for
their accuracy.
 

We have assumed, in all respects material to our analyses, the following: (i) that the Merger and any related transaction (including the Bank Merger) will be
completed substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement (the final terms of which we have assumed will not differ in any respect material to our
analyses from the draft reviewed by us referred to above) with no adjustments to the Merger Consideration and with no other payments in respect of Georgetown
Common Stock; (ii) that the representations and warranties of each party in the Agreement and in all related documents and instruments referred to in the Agreement are
true and correct; (iii) that each party to the Agreement and all related documents will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by such party
under such documents; (iv) that there are no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary regulatory or governmental approval for the
Merger or any related transaction (including the Bank Merger) and that all conditions to the completion of the Merger and any related transaction (including the Bank
Merger) will be satisfied without any waivers or modifications to the Agreement or any of the related documents; and (v) that in the course of obtaining the necessary
regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the Merger and any related transaction (including the Bank Merger), no restrictions, including any divestiture
requirements, termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that will have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations
or financial condition of Georgetown. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a manner that complies with all applicable federal and state statutes,
rules and regulations.  We have further been advised by Georgetown that Georgetown has relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or other appropriate

consideration to be received by, holders of any class of securities of Georgetown (other than the holders of Georgetown Common Stock (solely with respect to the Merger
Consideration, as described herein and not relative to any consideration to be received by holders of any other class of securities)) or any other party to any transaction
contemplated by the Agreement, (v) whether Salem Five has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it to pay the Merger
Consideration to the holders of Georgetown Common Stock at the closing of the Merger, (vi) any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Agreement, or (vii) any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to Georgetown, Salem Five,
their respective shareholders, Merger Sub, or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the Merger or any related transaction (including the Bank Merger).
 

This opinion is for the information of, and is directed to, the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the
Merger. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board as to how it should vote on the Merger, or to any holder of Georgetown Common Stock or any
shareholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with the Merger or any other matter, nor does it constitute a recommendation regarding whether or not any
such shareholder should enter into a voting, shareholders’, or affiliates’ agreement with respect to the Merger or exercise any dissenters’ or appraisal rights that may be
available to such shareholder.
 

This opinion has been reviewed and approved by our Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with our policies and procedures established under the
requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
