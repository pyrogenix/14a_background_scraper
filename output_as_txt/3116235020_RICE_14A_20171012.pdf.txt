MERGER PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT

Dear Shareholders of EQT Corporation and Stockholders of Rice Energy Inc.:

          On June 19, 2017, EQT Corporation ("EQT"), Eagle Merger Sub I, Inc., an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of EQT ("Merger
Sub"), and Rice Energy Inc. ("Rice") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "merger agreement"), providing for the merger of
Merger Sub with and into Rice, with Rice surviving the merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of EQT (the "merger"). Following
the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will merge with and into an indirect, wholly owned limited liability company
subsidiary of EQT, with the limited liability company subsidiary surviving the second merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
EQT.

          In connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, EQT will issue shares of common stock of EQT to
stockholders of Rice (the "share issuance"). Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), EQT is required to obtain
shareholder approval of the share issuance. Accordingly, EQT will hold a special meeting of shareholders (the "EQT special meeting") to
vote on the share issuance (the "share issuance proposal"). At the EQT special meeting, EQT will also propose that its shareholders
approve proposals (i) to amend and restate EQT's Restated Articles of Incorporation to provide that the number of members of the board of
directors of EQT (the "EQT board") be not less than five nor more than thirteen (the "charter amendment proposal") and (ii) to approve the
adjournment of the EQT special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to
approve the share issuance proposal (the "EQT adjournment proposal"). Approval of each of these proposals requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of the votes cast on each such proposal by holders of EQT's common stock. The EQT special meeting will be held on
November 9, 2017 at EQT Plaza, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222, at 8:00 a.m. local time. The EQT board unanimously
recommends that EQT shareholders vote "FOR" the share issuance proposal, "FOR" the charter amendment proposal and
"FOR" the EQT adjournment proposal.

          In addition, Rice will hold a special meeting of stockholders (the "Rice special meeting") to vote on a proposal to adopt the merger
agreement (the "merger agreement proposal") and approve related matters as described in the attached joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Under the laws of the State of Delaware, the approval of Rice's stockholders must be obtained before the merger can be completed.
Approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares
of Rice stock, in person or by proxy, entitled to vote on the merger agreement proposal. At the Rice special meeting, Rice will also propose
that its stockholders approve proposals (i) to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to Rice's named executive officers in connection with the merger (the "advisory compensation proposal") and (ii) to approve the
adjournment of the Rice special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt
the merger agreement (the "Rice adjournment proposal"). Approval of each of the advisory compensation proposal and the Rice
adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of Rice stock, present in
person or represented by proxy at the Rice special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposals. The Rice special meeting will be held on
November 9, 2017 at Rice's executive offices at 2200 Rice Drive, Canonsburg, PA 15317, at 8:00 a.m. local time. Rice's board of
directors unanimously recommends that Rice stockholders vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement, "FOR" the
advisory compensation proposal and "FOR" the Rice adjournment proposal.

          If the merger is completed, each outstanding share of Rice common stock (with certain exceptions described in the accompanying
joint proxy statement/prospectus) will convert into the right to receive 0.37 of a share of EQT common stock and $5.30 in cash, without
interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes. Although the number of shares of EQT common stock that Rice stockholders will
receive is fixed, the market value of the merger consideration will fluctuate with the market price of EQT common stock and will not be
known at the time that Rice stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement or at the time EQT shareholders vote to approve the share
issuance. Based on the closing price of EQT's common stock on the NYSE on June 16, 2017, the last trading day before the public
announcement of the merger, the 0.37 exchange ratio together with the $5.30 in cash represented approximately $27.04 in value for each
share of Rice common stock. Based on EQT's closing price on October 11, 2017 of $63.10, the 0.37 exchange ratio together with the $5.30
in cash represented approximately $28.65 in value for each share of Rice common stock. Based upon the estimated number of shares of
capital stock as well as the outstanding equity of the parties that will be outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the merger,
we estimate that, upon consummation of the transaction, existing EQT shareholders will hold approximately 65% and former Rice
stockholders will hold approximately 35% of the outstanding common stock of EQT. We urge you to obtain current market quotations
for EQT (trading symbol "EQT") and Rice (trading symbol "RICE").

          The obligations of EQT and Rice to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth
in the merger agreement, a copy of which is included as Annex A to the attached joint proxy statement/prospectus. The attached joint
proxy statement/prospectus describes the EQT special meeting, the Rice special meeting, the merger, the documents and agreements
related to the merger, the share issuance and other related matters. It also contains or references information about EQT and Rice and
certain related agreements and matters. Please carefully read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including "Risk Factors,"
beginning on page 34, for a discussion of the risks relating to the proposed merger. You also can obtain information about EQT and
Rice from documents that each has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

          Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the
securities to be issued in connection with the merger described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or determined if this joint
proxy statement/prospectus is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

          This document is dated October 12, 2017 and is first being mailed to shareholders of record of EQT and stockholders of record of
Rice on or about October 12, 2017.

Sincerely,

EQT CORPORATION
625 Liberty Avenue, Suite 1700
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON NOVEMBER 9, 2017

        This is a notice that a special meeting of shareholders (the "EQT special meeting") of EQT Corporation ("EQT") will be held on
November 9, 2017 at EQT Plaza, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222, at 8:00 a.m. local time. This special meeting will be held for
the following purposes:

1. to approve the issuance of shares of common stock of EQT, no par value, to shareholders of Rice Energy Inc. ("Rice") in
connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 19, 2017 (as it may be amended from time to time, the
"merger agreement"), by and among EQT, Eagle Merger Sub I, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of EQT, and Rice
(the "share issuance proposal"); 

2. to approve an amendment and restatement of EQT's Restated Articles of Incorporation in the form attached to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B to provide that the number of members of the board of directors of EQT (the "EQT
board") be not less than five nor more than thirteen (the "charter amendment proposal"); and 

3. to approve the adjournment of the EQT special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
not sufficient votes to approve the share issuance proposal (the "EQT adjournment proposal").

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the proposals listed above in more detail. Please refer to the attached
document, including the merger agreement and all other annexes and any documents incorporated by reference, for further
information with respect to the business to be transacted at the EQT special meeting. You are encouraged to read the entire
document carefully before voting. In particular, see the section titled "The Merger" beginning on page 56 for a description of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the share issuance contemplated by the share issuance proposal,
and the section titled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 34 for an explanation of the risks associated with the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the share issuance.

        The EQT board unanimously (i) determined the merger agreement and the other agreements and transactions contemplated
thereby, including, without limitation, the merger and the share issuance, are fair to and in the best interests of EQT and its
shareholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
share issuance and the charter amendment and (iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement.
The EQT board recommends that EQT shareholders vote "FOR" the share issuance proposal, "FOR" the charter amendment
proposal and "FOR" the EQT adjournment proposal.

        The EQT board has fixed September 25, 2017 as the record date for determination of EQT shareholders entitled to receive notice of,
and to vote at, the EQT special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. Only holders of record of EQT common stock at
the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the EQT special meeting.

        YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES THAT YOU OWN.    The merger
between EQT and Rice cannot be completed without the approval of the share issuance proposal by the affirmative vote of a majority of
the votes cast on the proposal by holders of EQT's common stock.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

        The following are some questions that you, as a shareholder of EQT Corporation ("EQT") or a stockholder of Rice Energy Inc.
("Rice"), may have regarding the merger, the issuance of shares of EQT common stock to Rice stockholders in connection with the merger
and other matters being considered at the special meetings of EQT's shareholders and Rice's stockholders (the "EQT special meeting" and
the "Rice special meeting," respectively) and the answers to those questions. EQT and Rice urge you to carefully read the remainder of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus because the information in this section does not provide all the information that might be important to
you with respect to the merger, the issuance of shares of EQT common stock in connection with the merger and the other matters being
considered at the EQT special meeting and the Rice special meeting. Additional important information is also contained in the annexes to
and the documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: Why am I receiving this document? 

A: EQT, Rice and Eagle Merger Sub I, Inc., an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of EQT ("Merger Sub"), have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 19, 2017 (as it may be amended from time to time, the "merger agreement"),
providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Rice, with Rice surviving the merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of EQT (the "merger"). Following the effective time of the merger (the "effective time," and the date of the effective time the
"closing date"), the surviving corporation in the merger will merge with and into an indirect wholly owned limited liability
company subsidiary of EQT, with the limited liability company subsidiary surviving the second merger as an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of EQT (the "post-closing merger" and together with the merger, the "mergers").

In order to complete the merger, EQT shareholders must approve the proposal to issue EQT common stock, no par value (the
"EQT common stock"), to the Rice stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement (the "share issuance proposal") and Rice
stockholders must approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement (the "merger agreement proposal"), and all other conditions
to the merger must be satisfied or waived.

EQT and Rice will hold separate special meetings to obtain these approvals and other related matters, including, in the case of
EQT, a vote to amend and restate EQT's Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "EQT articles") in the form attached to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B to provide that the number of members of EQT's board of directors (the "EQT board") be
not less than five nor more than thirteen (the "charter amendment proposal") and, in the case of Rice, a vote to approve, on an
advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Rice's named executive officers in
connection with the merger (the "compensation proposal").

This joint proxy statement/prospectus, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the share
issuance and other matters being considered at the EQT special meeting and the Rice special meeting.

Q: What will Rice stockholders receive for their shares of Rice common stock in the merger? 

Q: At the effective time, each share of Rice common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Rice common stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares of Rice common stock (1) (a) held in treasury by Rice or
(b) owned by EQT, Merger Sub or EQT Investments Holdings, LLC, the intermediate subsidiary of EQT that holds all of Merger
Sub's outstanding capital stock, which will automatically be canceled and cease to exist, (2) held by any wholly owned subsidiary
of EQT (other than Merger Sub or EQT Investments Holdings, LLC) or any wholly owned subsidiary of Rice, which will
automatically be converted into a number of shares of EQT common stock equal to the sum of (x) the stock consideration and
(y) the quotient

of the cash consideration and the last reported sale price of EQT common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE")
(as reported in The Wall Street Journal) on the closing date, or (3) held by any holder of record who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to and in compliance with the Delaware General Corporate Law (the "DGCL")
(the shares of Rice common stock described in clauses (1) through (3) together, "excluded shares")), will be cancelled and
converted automatically into the right to receive (i) 0.37 shares of EQT common stock (the "exchange ratio") in book-entry form
(the "stock consideration") (with cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any) and (ii) $5.30 in cash, without interest and subject to
applicable withholding taxes (the "cash consideration" and, together with the stock consideration, the "merger consideration").

In addition, Rice will take all actions as may be necessary so that at the effective time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award
or performance stock unit award in respect of Rice common stock will be treated as described in "The Merger—Interests of Certain
Rice Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

For additional information regarding the consideration to be received in the merger, see the section entitled "The Merger—Effects
of the Merger."

Q: If I am a Rice stockholder, how will I receive the merger consideration to which I am entitled? 

A: As soon as practicable after the effective time (but no later than the second business day after the closing date), an exchange agent
will mail to each holder of record of Rice common stock (whose shares were converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration pursuant to the merger agreement) a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
certificates of Rice common stock ("Rice stock certificates") and book-entry shares representing the shares of Rice common stock
("Rice book-entry shares") in exchange for the merger consideration. Upon receipt by the exchange agent of (i) either Rice stock
certificates or Rice book-entry shares and (ii) a signed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be required pursuant
to such instructions, the holder of such shares will be entitled to receive the merger consideration in exchange therefor. 

Q: Who will own EQT immediately following the transactions? 

A: EQT and Rice estimate that, upon completion of the merger, EQT shareholders as of immediately prior to the merger will hold
approximately 65% and Rice stockholders will hold approximately 35% of the outstanding common stock of EQT. 

Q: How important is my vote? 

A: Your vote "FOR" each proposal presented at the EQT special meeting and/or the Rice special meeting is very important, and you
are encouraged to submit a proxy as soon as possible.

Approval of the share issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal by holders of
EQT's common stock. Any abstention by an EQT shareholder will have the same effect as a vote against the share issuance
proposal. The failure of any EQT shareholder to submit a vote will not be counted in determining the votes cast in connection with
this proposal and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of the share issuance proposal. Approval of the charter amendment
proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal by holders of EQT's common stock. Failure to
vote and abstentions will not be counted as votes cast "for" or "against" the charter amendment proposal and will have no effect on
the outcome of the charter amendment proposal. Approval of the proposal to adjourn the EQT special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of the share issuance proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such
adjournment to

approve the share issuance (the "EQT adjournment proposal") requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the
proposal by holders of EQT's common stock. Failure to vote and abstentions will not be counted as votes cast "for" or "against" the
EQT adjournment proposal and will have no effect on the outcome of the charter amendment proposal.

Approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting power of the
outstanding shares of Rice stock, in person or by proxy, entitled to vote on the merger agreement proposal. Any abstention by a
Rice stockholder and the failure of any Rice stockholder to submit a vote will have the same effect as voting against the merger
agreement proposal. Adoption of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting
power of the shares of Rice stock, present in person or represented by proxy at the Rice special meeting and entitled to vote on the
compensation proposal. Abstentions are considered shares present and entitled to vote and will have the same effect as votes
"against" the compensation proposal. Since the compensation proposal is non-binding, if the merger agreement is approved by
Rice stockholders and the merger is completed, the compensation that is the subject of the compensation proposal, which includes
amounts EQT or Rice are contractually obligated to pay, would still be paid regardless of the outcome of the non-binding advisory
vote. Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Rice special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor
of the merger agreement proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to adopt the merger agreement
(the "Rice adjournment proposal") requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of Rice
stock, present in person or represented by proxy at the Rice special meeting and entitled to vote on the Rice adjournment proposal.
Abstentions are considered shares present and entitled to vote and will have the same effect as votes "against" the Rice
adjournment proposal.

Q: How do the EQT board and the Rice board recommend that I vote? 

A: The EQT board unanimously (i) determined the merger agreement and the other agreements and transactions contemplated
thereby, including, without limitation, the merger and the share issuance, are fair to and in the best interests of EQT and its
shareholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
share issuance and the charter amendment and (iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement. For
a detailed description of the various factors considered by the EQT board, see the section titled "The Merger—Recommendation of
the EQT Board and Reasons for the Merger."

Accordingly, the EQT board unanimously recommends that EQT shareholders vote "FOR" the share issuance proposal, "FOR" the
charter amendment proposal and "FOR" the EQT adjournment proposal.

Rice's board of directors (the "Rice board"), after considering the various factors described under "The Merger—Recommendation
of the Rice Board and Reasons for the Merger," the comprehensive process conducted by the Rice board and the alternatives to the
merger (including remaining as a stand-alone company), has unanimously determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
Rice's stockholders to enter into the merger agreement, and unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, and resolved to recommend the adoption of the merger agreement by
Rice's stockholders and that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of Rice's stockholders.

Accordingly, the Rice board recommends that you vote "FOR" the merger agreement proposal, "FOR" the compensation proposal
and "FOR" the Rice adjournment proposal.

Table of Contents

Q: Will the EQT common stock received at the time of completion of the merger be traded on an exchange? 

A: Yes. It is a condition to the consummation of the merger that the shares of EQT common stock to be issued to Rice stockholders in
connection with the merger be authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. 

Q: How will EQT shareholders be affected by the merger? 

A: Upon completion of the merger, each EQT shareholder will hold the same number of shares of EQT common stock that such
shareholder held immediately prior to completion of the merger. As a result of the merger, EQT shareholders will own shares in a
larger company with more assets. However, because in connection with the merger, EQT will be issuing additional shares of EQT
common stock to Rice stockholders in exchange for their shares of Rice common stock, each outstanding share of EQT common
stock immediately prior to the merger will represent a smaller percentage of the aggregate number of shares of EQT common stock
outstanding after the merger. 

Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger? 

A: It is intended that the merger and the post-closing merger, taken together, qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). It is a condition to each of EQT's and Rice's
obligation to complete the mergers that it receive a written opinion from its counsel, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Vinson &
Elkins LLP, respectively, to the effect that the mergers, taken together, will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Accordingly, assuming the receipt and accuracy of such opinions, a U.S. holder (as defined under "The
Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences") of shares of Rice common stock that receives shares of EQT common
stock and cash in exchange for shares of Rice common stock pursuant to the merger generally will recognize gain (but not loss) in
an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount by which the sum of the fair market value of the EQT common stock and cash
received by the U.S. holder exceeds such U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares of Rice common stock surrendered and
(ii) the amount of cash received by such U.S. holder. Holders of Rice common stock that are not U.S. holders and that receive
shares of EQT common stock and cash pursuant to the merger may be subject to U.S. withholding tax with respect to cash
received.

Holders of Rice common stock should read the section entitled "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences" for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers. Tax matters can
be complicated, and the tax consequences to a particular holder will depend on such holder's particular facts and
circumstances. Rice stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the specific consequences to them of
receiving EQT common stock and cash pursuant to the merger.

Q: When do EQT and Rice expect to complete the merger? 

A: EQT and Rice currently expect to complete the merger in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. However, neither EQT nor Rice
can predict the actual date on which the merger will be completed, nor can the parties assure that the merger will be completed,
because completion is subject to conditions beyond either company's control. See the sections entitled "The Merger—Regulatory
Approvals" and "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger." 

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed? 

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by Rice's stockholders, the share issuance is not approved by EQT's shareholders or the
merger is not completed for any other reason, Rice's stockholders

company, Rice common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and Rice will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Rice's
common stock.

Under specified circumstances, Rice and/or EQT may be required to reimburse the other party's expenses or pay a termination fee
upon termination of the merger agreement, as described under "The Merger Agreement—Expenses and Termination Fees Relating
to the Termination of the Merger Agreement."

at the EQT special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the EQT special meeting, so long as such shares remain

Each outstanding share of Rice common stock entitles its holder of record to one vote on each matter considered at the Rice special
meeting; each 1/1000th of an outstanding share of Rice Class A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Rice preferred
stock" and together with the Rice common stock, "Rice stock") entitles its holder of record to one vote on each matter considered
at the Rice special meeting. Only Rice stockholders who held shares of record at the close of business on September 21, 2017 are
entitled to vote at the Rice special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the Rice special meeting, so long as such
shares remain outstanding on the date of the Rice special meeting.

Q: Who can vote at each of the EQT special meeting and the Rice special meeting? 

A: All holders of shares of EQT common stock who hold such shares of record at the close of business on September 25, 2017, the
record date for the EQT special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the EQT special meeting.

All holders of shares of Rice common stock and Rice preferred stock who hold such shares of record at the close of business on
September 21, 2017, the record date for the Rice special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Rice special
meeting.

Q: What are the record dates in connection with each of the EQT special meeting and the Rice special meeting? 

A: The record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the EQT special meeting is September 25,

A: If you submit your proxy via the Internet, by telephone or by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card,
your proxy will be voted in accordance with your instructions.

Additional information on voting procedures can be found under the section titled "EQT Special Meeting" and under the section

Q: Who will count the votes?

the close of business on September 21, 2017, you may attend your special meeting and vote your shares in person, in lieu of
submitting your proxy by Internet, telephone or by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card.

If you are a beneficial holder of EQT common stock or Rice common stock, you are also invited to attend the EQT special meeting

valid "legal proxy" from your bank, broker or nominee.

Q: What must I bring to attend my special meeting?

license or passport) for admittance. The additional items, if any, that attendees must bring depend on whether they are shareholders
or stockholders of record, beneficial owners or proxy holders.

Additionally, EQT shareholders planning to attend the EQT special meeting will need an admission ticket. Holders of shares in
registered name or through EQT's Employee Savings Plan or EQT's 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "EQT 2014 LTIP") can
obtain an admission ticket by checking the appropriate box on their proxy card or direction card, or by writing to EQT's Corporate
Secretary at 625 Liberty Avenue, Suite 1700, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, Attn: Corporate Secretary. Beneficial owners
holding through a broker, bank or other holder of record, must write to EQT's Corporate Secretary at 625 Liberty Avenue,
Suite 1700, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, Attn: Corporate Secretary AND must include proof of your ownership of EQT
common stock as of the record date, such as a copy of your brokerage account statement or an omnibus proxy, which you can
obtain from your broker, bank or other holder of record, and EQT will send you an admission ticket for the special meeting.

Additional information on attending the EQT special meeting and the Rice special meeting can be found under the section titled
"EQT Special Meeting" and under the section titled "Rice Special Meeting."

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the EQT special meeting or the Rice special
meeting? 

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials for the EQT special meeting or the Rice special meeting or both, including
multiple copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction forms. For example, if you
hold your EQT common stock or Rice common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting
instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a holder of record and your shares are registered
in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please submit each separate proxy or voting instruction form
that you receive by following the instructions set forth in each separate proxy or voting instruction form. 

Q: What's the difference between holding shares as a shareholder or stockholder of record and holding shares as a beneficial
owner? 

A: If your shares of EQT common stock or Rice common stock are registered directly in your name with EQT's transfer agent,
Computershare, or Rice's transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to
those shares, to be the shareholder of record, in the case of EQT, or the stockholder of record, in the case of Rice. If you are a
shareholder or stockholder of record, then this joint proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by EQT or
Rice, as applicable.

If your shares of EQT common stock or Rice common stock are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered
the beneficial owner of the shares of EQT common stock or Rice common stock held in "street name." In that case, this proxy
statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be
the shareholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote
your shares by following their instructions for voting, and you are also invited to attend the EQT special meeting or the Rice
special meeting, as applicable. However, because you are not the shareholder or stockholder of record, you may not vote your
shares in person at the EQT special meeting or the Rice special meeting, as applicable, unless you request and obtain a valid "legal
proxy" from your bank, broker or nominee.

Q: If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker, bank or other nominee
automatically vote my shares for me? 

A: No. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive separate instructions from your broker,
bank or other nominee describing how to vote your shares. The availability of Internet or telephonic voting will depend on the
nominee's voting process. Please check with your broker, bank or other nominee and follow the voting procedures provided by
your broker, bank or other nominee on your voting instruction form.

You should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares. Under the rules applicable to broker-dealers, your
broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on any of the proposals scheduled to be
voted on at the EQT special meeting or the Rice special meeting. A so-called "broker non-vote" results when banks, brokers and
other nominees return a valid proxy but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to
vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. EQT and Rice do
not expect any broker non-votes at the EQT special meeting or Rice special meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers
and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine, whereas
each of the proposals to be presented at the EQT special meeting and Rice special meeting are considered non-routine. As a result,
no broker will be permitted to vote your shares at the EQT special meeting or Rice special meeting without receiving instructions.
Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote your shares will have no effect on the outcome of the share issuance proposal or the
charter amendment proposal, but will have the same effect as a vote "against" the adoption of the merger agreement proposal.

Additional information on voting procedures can be found under the section titled "EQT Special Meeting" and under the section
titled "Rice Special Meeting."

Q: How do I vote shares of EQT common stock held through EQT's Employee Savings Plan? 

A: If you hold shares through EQT's Employee Savings Plan, you will receive a separate voting direction card. The trustee of the EQT
Employee Savings Plan will vote your shares in accordance with the instructions on your returned direction card.

If you do not return a direction card or if you return a direction card with no instructions, the trustee will vote your shares in
proportion to the way other plan participants voted their shares. Please note that the direction cards have an earlier return date than
the proxy cards. Please review your direction card for the date by which your instructions must be received in order for your shares
to be voted.

In the case of Internet or telephone voting, you should have your direction card in hand and retain the card until you have
completed the voting process. If you vote by Internet or telephone, you do not need to return the direction card by mail.

Q: How do I vote restricted shares of EQT common stock held through EQT's 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan? 

A: Employees of EQT holding restricted shares through the EQT 2014 LTIP will receive a separate voting direction card. The
administrator of the EQT 2014 LTIP (or its designee) will vote your restricted shares in accordance with the instructions on your
returned direction card.

If you return a direction card with no instructions, the administrator or its designee will vote your shares as recommended by the
EQT board. If you do not return a direction card, your shares will not be voted. Please note that the direction cards have an earlier
return date than the proxy cards.

Q: What do I do if I am an EQT shareholder and I want to revoke my proxy? 

A: Shareholders of record may revoke their proxies at any time before their shares are voted at the EQT special meeting in any of the
following ways: 

• sending a written notice of revocation to EQT at 625 Liberty Avenue, Suite 1700, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222,
Attention: Corporate Secretary, which must be received before their shares are voted at the EQT special meeting; 

• properly submitting a later-dated, new proxy card, which must be received before their shares are voted at the EQT special
meeting (in which case only the later-dated proxy is counted and the earlier proxy is revoked); 

• submitting a proxy via the Internet or by telephone at a later date, which must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
November 8, 2017 (in which case only the later-dated proxy is counted and the earlier proxy is revoked); or 

• attending the EQT special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the EQT special meeting will not, however, in and
of itself, constitute a vote or revocation of a prior proxy.

Beneficial owners of EQT common stock may change their voting instruction by submitting new voting instructions to the brokers,
banks or other nominees that hold their shares of record or by requesting a "legal proxy" from such broker, bank or other nominee
and voting in person at the EQT special meeting.

Additional information can be found under the section titled "EQT Special Meeting."

Q: What do I do if I am a Rice stockholder and I want to revoke my proxy? 

A: Stockholders of record may revoke their proxies at any time before their shares are voted at the Rice special meeting in any of the
following ways: 

• sending a written notice of revocation to Rice at 2200 Rice Drive, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317, Attention: Investor
Relations, which must be received before their shares are voted at the Rice special meeting; 

• properly submitting a later-dated, new proxy card, which must be received before their shares are voted at the Rice special
meeting (in which case only the later-dated proxy is counted and the earlier proxy is revoked); 

• submitting a proxy via the Internet or by telephone at a later date, which must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
November 8, 2017 (in which case only the later-dated proxy is counted and the earlier proxy is revoked); or 

• attending the Rice special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Rice special meeting will not, however, in and
of itself, constitute a vote or revocation of a prior proxy.

Beneficial owners of Rice common stock may change their voting instruction by submitting new voting instructions to the brokers,
banks or other nominees that hold their shares of record or by requesting a "legal proxy" from such broker, bank or other nominee
and voting in person at the EQT special meeting.

Additional information can be found under the section entitled "Rice Special Meeting."

Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of EQT common stock before the EQT special meeting? 

A: The record date for shareholders entitled to vote at the EQT special meeting is September 25, 2017, which is earlier than the date
of the EQT special meeting. If you sell or otherwise transfer your shares after the record date but before the EQT special meeting,
unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you transfer your shares
and each of you notifies us in writing of such special arrangements, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the EQT
special meeting but will otherwise transfer ownership of your shares of EQT common stock. 

Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Rice common stock before the Rice special meeting? 

A: The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Rice special meeting is September 21, 2017, which is earlier than the date of
the Rice special meeting. If you sell or otherwise transfer your shares after the record date but before the Rice special meeting,
unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you transfer your shares
and each of you notifies us in writing of such special arrangements, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the Rice
special meeting but will otherwise transfer ownership of your shares of Rice common stock. 

Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Rice common stock before the completion of the merger? 

A: Only holders of shares of Rice common stock at the effective time will become entitled to receive the merger consideration. If you
sell your shares of Rice common stock prior to the completion of the merger, you will not become entitled to receive the merger
consideration by virtue of the merger. 

Q: Do any of the officers or directors of Rice have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in addition to my interests
as a Rice stockholder? 

A: In considering the recommendation of the Rice board that Rice stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement proposal, to
approve the compensation proposal and to approve the Rice adjournment proposal, Rice stockholders should be aware that some of
Rice's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
Rice stockholders generally. The Rice board was aware of and considered these potential interests, among other matters, in
evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, in approving the merger and in
recommending the adoption of the merger and the approval of the compensation proposal and the Rice adjournment proposal.

For more information and quantification of these interests, please see "The Merger—Interests of Certain Rice Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger."

Q: Where can I find voting results of the EQT special meeting and the Rice special meeting? 

A: Rice and EQT intend to announce their respective preliminary voting results at each of the Rice and EQT special meetings and
publish the final results in Current Reports on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the Rice special meeting and the
EQT special meeting, respectively. All reports that Rice and EQT file with the SEC are publicly available when filed. See the
section titled "Where You Can Find More Information."

Q: Do EQT shareholders and Rice stockholders have dissenters' rights or appraisal rights, as applicable? 

A: EQT shareholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights in connection with the merger. Rice stockholders are entitled to appraisal
rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL, provided they satisfy the special criteria and conditions set
forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Rice common stock held by stockholders that do not vote for approval of the merger and make a
demand for appraisal in accordance with Delaware law will not be converted into EQT common stock, but will be converted into
the right to receive from the combined company consideration determined in accordance with Delaware law. For further

Merger—Appraisal Rights and Dissenters' Rights" and "Appraisal Rights and Dissenters' Rights."

The Parties (see pages 41 and 42) 

EQT Corporation

        EQT Corporation conducts its business through three business segments: EQT Production, EQT Gathering and EQT
Transmission. EQT Production is the largest natural gas producer in the Appalachian Basin, based on average daily sales volumes,
with 13.5 Tcfe of proved natural gas, natural gas liquids ("NGLs") and crude oil reserves across approximately 3.6 million gross
acres, including approximately 790,000 gross acres in the Marcellus play, as of December 31, 2016. EQT Gathering and EQT
Transmission provide gathering, transmission and storage services for EQT's produced gas, as well as for independent third parties
across the Appalachian Basin, through EQT's ownership and control of EQT Midstream Partners, LP ("EQM") (NYSE: EQM), a
publicly traded limited partnership formed by EQT to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets in the Appalachian
Basin.

        In 2015, EQT formed EQT GP Holdings, LP ("EQGP") (NYSE: EQGP), a Delaware limited partnership, to own EQT's
partnership interests, including the incentive distribution rights ("IDRs"), in EQM. As of June 30, 2017, EQT owned the entire non-
economic general partner interest and 239,715,000 common units, which represented a 90.1% limited partner interest, in EQGP. As
of June 30, 2017, EQGP's only cash-generating assets were the following EQM partnership interests: 21,811,643 EQM common
units, representing a 26.6% limited partner interest in EQM; 1,443,015 EQM general partner units, representing a 1.8% general
partner interest in EQM; and all of EQM's IDRs, which entitle EQGP to receive 48.0% of all incremental cash distributed in a
quarter after $0.5250 has been distributed in respect of each common unit and general partner unit of EQM for that quarter. EQT is
the ultimate parent company of EQGP and EQM.

Eagle Merger Sub I, Inc.

        Merger Sub is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of EQT. Merger Sub was formed by EQT solely in contemplation of the
merger, has not conducted any business and has no assets, liabilities or other obligations of any nature other than as set forth in the
merger agreement. Its principal executive offices are located at c/o EQT Corporation, 625 Liberty Avenue, Suite 1700, Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania 15222 and its telephone number is (412) 553-5700.

Rice Energy Inc.

        Rice Energy Inc. is an independent natural gas and oil company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of
natural gas, oil and NGL properties in the Appalachian Basin. Rice operates in three business segments, which are managed
separately due to their distinct operational differences. The Exploration and Production segment is engaged in the acquisition,
exploration and development of natural gas, oil and NGLs. The Rice Midstream Holdings segment is engaged in the gathering and
compression of natural gas production in Belmont and Monroe Counties, Ohio. The Rice Midstream Partners segment is engaged in

statement/prospectus as the compensation proposal), discussed under the heading "The Merger—Interests of Certain
Rice Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

meeting, so long as such shares remain outstanding on the date of the Rice special meeting. Each share of Rice common stock
entitles its holder of record to one vote at the Rice special meeting on each matter considered at the Rice special meeting. Each
outstanding share of Rice common stock entitles its holder of record to one vote on each matter considered at the Rice special
meeting and each 1/1000th of an outstanding share of Rice preferred stock will be entitled to one vote on each matter considered at
the Rice special meeting.

        Quorum.    In order for business to be conducted at the Rice special meeting, a quorum must be present. A quorum requires the

the Rice special meeting. For purposes of determining whether there is a quorum, all shares that are present and entitled to vote will
count towards the quorum, including abstentions.

        Vote Required.    The votes required for each proposal are as follows:

• Proposal 1—the merger agreement proposal.  The affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting power of the
outstanding shares of Rice stock, in person or by proxy, entitled to vote on the merger agreement proposal is
required to adopt the merger agreement proposal. 

• Proposal 2—the compensation proposal.  The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the
shares of Rice stock, present in person or represented by proxy at the Rice special meeting and entitled to vote on the
compensation proposal, is required to approve the compensation proposal. Since the votes for the merger-related
compensation proposal are non-binding, if the merger agreement is approved by Rice's stockholders and the merger
is completed, the compensation that is the subject of the compensation proposal, which includes amounts Rice or
EQT are contractually obligated to pay, would still be paid regardless of the outcome of the non-binding advisory
vote on the compensation proposal. 

• Proposal 3—the Rice adjournment proposal.  The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of
the shares of Rice stock, present in person or represented by proxy at the Rice special meeting and entitled to vote on
the Rice adjournment proposal, is required to approve the Rice adjournment proposal.

        As of the close of business on the record date, there were 227,957,481 shares of Rice common stock outstanding, held by 23
holders of record and 15,217 shares of Rice preferred stock outstanding held by six holders of record. As of the record date,
directors and executive officers of Rice, as a group, owned and were entitled to vote 3,492,019 shares of Rice common stock and no
shares of Rice preferred stock, or approximately 1.44% of the voting power of outstanding shares of Rice.

The Merger (see page 56) 

        Upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing in the merger agreement, on the closing date, Merger Sub, an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of EQT formed for the purpose of effecting the merger, will merge with and into Rice. Rice will be the
surviving company in the merger. At the effective time, each share of Rice common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time (other than excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive 0.37 of a share of EQT common stock,
with cash paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of EQT common stock, and $5.30 in cash, without interest and subject to
applicable withholding taxes. In addition, Rice will take all actions as may be necessary so that at the effective time, each
outstanding restricted stock unit award or performance stock unit award in respect of Rice common stock will be treated as
described in "The Merger—Treatment of Rice Equity Awards."

Recommendation of the EQT Board and Reasons for the Merger (see page 68) 

        The EQT board recommends that EQT shareholders vote "FOR" the share issuance proposal, "FOR" the charter
amendment proposal and "FOR" the EQT adjournment proposal.

        In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the share issuance and the charter amendment, the EQT board considered a number of factors in its
deliberations. For a more complete discussion of these factors, see "The Merger—Recommendation of the EQT Board and Reasons
for the Merger."

Recommendation of the Rice Board and Reasons for the Merger (see page 73) 

        The Rice board recommends that Rice stockholders vote "FOR" the merger agreement proposal, "FOR" the
compensation proposal and "FOR" the Rice adjournment proposal.

        In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger contemplated by the merger agreement,
the Rice board considered a number of factors in its deliberations. For a more complete discussion of these factors, see "The Merger
—Recommendation of the Rice Board and Reasons for the Merger."

Opinion of EQT's Financial Advisor (see page 86) 

        In connection with the mergers, EQT's financial advisor, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("Citi"), delivered a written opinion,
dated June 19, 2017, to the EQT board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the
merger consideration to be paid by EQT pursuant to the merger agreement. The full text of Citi's written opinion, dated June 19,
2017, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the
review undertaken, is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus by reference. The description of Citi's opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of Citi's opinion. Citi's opinion was provided for the information of the EQT board (in its capacity as such) in connection
with its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view and did not address any other terms, aspects
or implications of the mergers or related transactions. Citi expressed no view as to, and its opinion did not address, the
underlying business decision of EQT to effect or enter into the mergers or any related transactions, the relative merits of the
mergers or any related transactions as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for EQT or the effect
of any other transaction in which EQT might engage or consider. Citi's opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute
a recommendation to any securityholder as to how such securityholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the
proposed mergers, any related transactions or otherwise.

Opinion of Rice's Financial Advisor (see page 106) 

        In connection with the merger, on June 18, 2017, Rice's financial advisor, Barclays Capital Inc., ("Barclays") rendered its oral
opinion (which opinion was subsequently confirmed in writing) to the Rice board that, as of such date and based upon and subject
to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the merger consideration to be offered to Rice stockholders
(other than holders of shares of Rice common stock (a) that are subject to perfected appraisal rights, (b) held in treasury by Rice or
owned by EQT, Merger Sub or EQT Investments Holdings, LLC, which will automatically be canceled and cease to exist or (c) held
by any other wholly owned subsidiary of EQT or Rice (collectively, the "excluded shares") is fair, from a financial point of view, to
such stockholders. The full text of Barclays' written opinion, dated June 19, 2017, which describes the assumptions made,
procedures followed, factors considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering its opinion, is attached
as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. The
summary of Barclays' opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Barclays' opinion.

        Barclays' opinion is addressed to the Rice board, addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Rice
stockholders (other than holders of excluded shares) of the merger consideration to be offered to such stockholders and does
not constitute a recommendation to any Rice stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the merger
or any other matter. The terms of the merger were determined through arm's-length negotiations between Rice and EQT
and were unanimously approved by the Rice board. Barclays did not recommend any specific form of consideration to Rice
or that any specific form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. Barclays was not
requested to opine as to, and its opinion does not in any manner address, Rice's underlying business decision to proceed with
or effect the merger or the likelihood of consummation of the merger. In addition, Barclays expressed no opinion on, and its
opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers,
directors or employees of any parties to the merger or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be offered to
Rice stockholders in connection with the merger. Barclays' opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as
compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which Rice might engage.

        For further information, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "The Merger—Opinion of Rice's
Financial Advisor" and Annex D.

Financing of the Transactions (see page 128) 

        Excluding any funds required to refinance and/or pay off any indebtedness of Rice and its subsidiaries on the closing date and
cash severance costs, EQT anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to finance the transactions and to pay transaction fees
and expenses will be approximately $1.8 billion. This amount is expected to be funded through a combination of available cash on
hand, borrowings under EQT's existing revolving credit facility and proceeds from the issuance and sale by EQT of senior
unsecured notes. In connection with the transactions, EQT received debt financing commitments in the amount of $1.4 billion. On
October 4, 2017 EQT terminated its $1.4 billion debt financing commitments and closed an offering of $3.0 billion of its fixed and
floating rate senior notes. The merger, however, is not conditioned upon receipt of this or any other financing by EQT. For a more
complete discussion of the financing of the transactions, see "The Merger—Financing of the Transactions."

Interests of Certain Rice Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 128) 

        Rice's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
the Rice stockholders generally. The members of the Rice board were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters,
in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending that Rice stockholders adopt the merger
agreement.

Table of Contents

        These interests include, among others:

• Rice's directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the
merger agreement. 

• If the effective time occurs before the time that Rice's 2017 bonuses would be paid in the ordinary course of
business, each Rice executive officer will receive a bonus payment equal to 200% of the executive's target bonus
opportunity in respect of any 2017 bonus to which they would otherwise be entitled. 

• Each Rice executive officer is a party to an employment agreement with Rice that would provide that executive with
certain compensation and benefits in the event that the executive experiences a qualifying termination in connection
with the merger. 

• Rice performance stock units held by the executive officers will be converted into time-based restricted stock units
of EQT, and the performance conditions applicable to such Rice performance stock units will be deemed to have
been met at the maximum level at the effective time.

        Rice's directors and executive officers hold equity compensation plan awards under Rice's Amended and Restated 2014 Long-
Term Incentive Plan (the "Rice LTIP"), the vesting of which will be accelerated if the executive experiences a qualifying
termination. See the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled "The Merger—Interests of Certain Rice Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger" for a more detailed description of the interests of Rice's executive officers and directors.

Board of Directors and Management of EQT Following Completion of the Merger (see page 135) 

        In the merger agreement, EQT has agreed, subject to the approval of the charter amendment proposal by EQT's shareholders,
to increase the size of the EQT board to thirteen directors and cause Daniel J. Rice IV and Robert F. Vagt (each, a "Rice designee")
to become members of the EQT board upon the effective time. If EQT's shareholders do not approve the charter amendment
proposal at the EQT special meeting, EQT has agreed to increase the size of the EQT board to twelve directors and appoint either
Mr. Rice or Mr. Vagt, at Rice's election, upon the effective time and to seek shareholder approval to increase the maximum size of
the EQT board specified in the EQT articles to thirteen directors at its next annual meeting of shareholders and appoint the Rice
designee not appointed upon the effective time.

        Upon completion of the merger, the current directors and executive officers of EQT are expected to continue in their current
positions, other than as may be publicly announced by EQT in the normal course.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (see page 135) 

        It is intended that the merger and the post-closing merger, taken together, qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. It is a condition to each of EQT's and Rice's obligation to complete the mergers that it receive a written
opinion from its counsel, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Vinson & Elkins LLP, respectively, to the effect that the mergers,
taken together, will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Accordingly, assuming the
receipt and accuracy of such opinions, a U.S. holder (as defined under "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences") of shares of Rice common stock that receives shares of EQT common stock and cash in exchange for shares of
Rice common stock pursuant to the merger generally will recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the
amount by which the sum of the fair market value of the EQT common stock and cash received by the U.S. holder exceeds such
U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares of Rice common stock surrendered and (ii) the amount of cash received by such U.S.
holder. Holders of Rice common stock that are not U.S. holders and that receive shares of EQT common stock and cash pursuant to
the merger may be subject to U.S. withholding tax with respect to cash received.

Table of Contents

        Holders of Rice common stock should read the section entitled "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences" for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers. Tax matters can
be complicated, and the tax consequences to a particular holder will depend on such holder's particular facts and
circumstances. Rice stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the specific consequences to them of
receiving EQT stock and cash pursuant to the merger.

Accounting Treatment (see page 138) 

        EQT prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
("GAAP"). The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with EQT being considered the acquirer of
Rice for accounting purposes. This means that EQT will allocate the purchase price to the fair value of Rice's tangible and
intangible assets and liabilities at the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price (if any) being recorded as goodwill. Under the
acquisition method of accounting, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually.

Regulatory Approvals Required to Complete the Merger (see page 139) 

        The completion of the merger is subject to antitrust review in the United States. Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and the rules promulgated thereunder, the merger cannot be completed
until the parties to the merger agreement have given notification and furnished information to the Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), and until the applicable waiting period has expired or has been
terminated.

        On June 30, 2017, EQT and Rice each filed a premerger notification and report form under the HSR Act and on July 18, 2017,
the FTC granted early termination under the HSR Act.

        Additionally, in connection with the share issuance proposal, EQT must file a registration statement with the SEC under the
Exchange Act that is declared effective by the SEC.

Treatment of Rice Equity Awards (see page 139) 

        At the effective time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award or performance stock unit award in respect of Rice common
stock that is held by an employee or other service provider of Rice (including Rice directors) who will be continuing with EQT
following the effective time will be converted into a restricted stock unit award, with substantially the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to the pre-conversion award, in respect of a number of shares of EQT common stock equal to the product (rounded
to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Rice common stock subject to the pre-conversion award multiplied by
(ii) the sum of (a) the exchange ratio plus (b) the quotient of the cash consideration divided by the average closing price of EQT
common stock for the five consecutive trading days ending on the last complete trading day prior to the effective time (the "stock
award exchange ratio"). Performance conditions that are applicable to any such Rice performance stock units will be deemed to
have been met at the maximum level specified in the award at the effective time, and the converted awards will be subject solely to
time-based vesting.

        For Rice employees identified by EQT prior to the effective time as not continuing to be employed following the effective
time, at the effective time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award or performance stock unit award in respect of Rice common
stock will vest and be settled within seven business days following the closing date for the merger consideration with respect to
each share of Rice common stock subject to such awards. Performance conditions that are applicable to such Rice performance
stock units will be deemed to have been met at the maximum level specified in the award at the effective time.

Table of Contents

        See the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "The Merger—Interests of Certain Rice Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger" for a detailed description of the treatment of Rice equity awards.

Agreement with Certain Rice Stockholders (see page 140) 

        Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, EQT entered into a voting and support agreement, a copy of which
is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex F (the "voting agreement"), with Rice Energy 2016 Irrevocable Trust,
Rice Energy Holdings LLC, Daniel J. Rice III, Daniel J. Rice IV, Derek A. Rice and Toby Z. Rice (collectively, the "named Rice
stockholders"), pursuant to which each of the named Rice stockholders has agreed, among other matters and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the voting agreement, to vote all of their shares of Rice common stock in favor of the merger
agreement proposal and the other actions contemplated by the merger agreement and against any proposal that would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the consummation of the merger set forth in the merger agreement not being fulfilled. As of
the record date for the Rice special meeting, the named Rice stockholders held approximately 36,832,830 shares of Rice common
stock in the aggregate, or approximately 15.1% of the voting power of Rice as of the record date.

Agreements with Certain Executive Officers and Directors of Rice (see page 132) 

        In connection with the execution of the merger agreement and effective immediately following the closing of the merger, Rice
entered into (i) an amendment to the employment agreements with each of the executive officers and (ii) a confidentiality, non-
solicitation and non-competition agreement with Daniel J. Rice III (the "Daniel J. Rice, III Agreement"), each as described in the
"The Merger—Interests of Certain Rice Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger." The amendments amend terms of the
executive officers' existing obligations under their respective employment agreements to refrain from competing with the business
of Rice. The employment agreement amendments provide, among other terms, that the executive officers may not engage in certain
competitive activities with Rice during the time of their employment and for a period of three years after the end of such
employment in any location within the Appalachian Basin, as defined by the United States Energy Information Administration (the
"Appalachian Basin"). The Daniel J. Rice, III Agreement imposes confidentiality and noncompetition covenants on Mr. Rice III that
are comparable to those applicable to the executive officers under their amended employment agreements, with the noncompetition
period running for three years from the closing of the merger.

Listing of EQT Common Stock; Delisting of Rice Common Stock (see page 140) 

        It is a condition to the consummation of the merger that the shares of EQT common stock to be issued to Rice stockholders in
the merger be authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. As a result of the merger, shares of Rice
common stock currently listed on the NYSE will cease to be listed on the NYSE.

Appraisal Rights and Dissenters' Rights (see page 141) 

        Rice stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, provided they satisfy the special criteria and
conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Rice common stock held by stockholders that do not vote for approval of the
merger and make a demand for appraisal in accordance with Delaware law will not be converted into EQT common stock, but will
be converted into the right to receive from the combined company consideration determined in accordance with Delaware law.

        Under the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law ("PBCL"), as well as the governing documents of EQT, EQT shareholders
are not entitled to dissenters' rights in connection with the merger or the transactions contemplated by the merger.

Litigation Relating to the Merger (see page 144) 

        On August 2, 2017, a class action lawsuit related to the merger was filed against Rice and its directors. On August 3, 2017, a
second class action lawsuit was filed against Rice and its directors, also naming EQT and Merger Sub as defendants. On August 11,
2017, two additional class action lawsuits were filed against Rice and its directors, one of which also named EQT and Merger Sub
as defendants. On August 15, 2017, a fifth class action lawsuit was filed against Rice and its directors. Also on August 15, 2017, a
derivative lawsuit was filed against members of the EQT board, with EQT as a nominal defendant; the parties have entered into a
memorandum of understanding providing for the resolution of this matter. EQT and Rice believe the claims in each complaint are
without merit. See the section entitled "Litigation Relating to the Merger."

No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals (see page 155) 

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, each of EQT and Rice have agreed that they will not, and will cause their respective
subsidiaries and will use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals, or offers regarding, or the making of a competing
proposal (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals"), (ii) engage in any discussions or
negotiations with respect to a competing proposal or (iii) furnish any non-public information, or access to its properties, assets or
employees, to any person in connection with or in response to a competing proposal or enter into any letter of intent or agreement in
principle, or other agreement providing for a competing proposal.

        The parties are permitted, prior to obtaining the applicable shareholder or stockholder approval of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, to engage in the activities described above solely with and to any person who has made a
written, bona fide competing proposal that did not result from a breach of the applicable party's non-solicitation obligations;
provided, that (A) no non-public information may be furnished until the party receives an executed confidentiality agreement
containing limitations on the use and disclosure of non-public information no less favorable to that party in the aggregate than the
terms of the confidentiality agreement between EQT and Rice; and (B) prior to taking any such actions, the party's board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such competing proposal is, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a superior proposal (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative
Proposals"), and, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to engage in such activities would be inconsistent
with the board's duties under applicable law.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (see page 161) 

        The obligations of Rice and EQT to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permissible
under applicable laws) of the following mutual conditions:

• adoption of the merger agreement proposal by Rice stockholders and approval of the share issuance proposal by
EQT shareholders; 

• any waiting period applicable to the merger under the HSR Act shall have been terminated or expired; 

• absence of any order, decree, ruling, injunction or other action that is in effect (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger, and no law shall have
been adopted that makes consummation of the merger illegal or otherwise prohibited; 

• the registration statement on Form S-4 filed by EQT in connection with the share issuance having been declared
effective by the SEC and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Form S-4 having been issued by the
SEC and no proceedings for that purpose having been sought by the SEC; and

• EQT common stock issued in the merger having been approved for listing on the NYSE, upon official notice of
issuance.

        The obligation of Rice to effect the merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Rice of the following additional
conditions:

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties of EQT and Merger Sub set forth in the merger agreement, subject
to the materiality standards set forth in the merger agreement, as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the
closing date of the merger (except to the extent such representations and warranties are expressly made as of a
specific date, in which case such representations and warranties will be true and correct as of such specific date
only), and Rice's receipt of an officer's certificate from EQT to such effect; 

• performance of, or compliance with, in all material respects all agreements and covenants required to be performed
or complied with under the merger agreement by EQT at or prior to the effective time (and Rice's receipt of an
officer's certificate from EQT to such effect); 

• the absence, since the date of the merger agreement, of any event, change, effect or development that, individually or
in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect with respect to EQT; and

• the receipt by Rice of a written tax opinion from Vinson & Elkins LLP, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Rice and dated as of the closing date, to the effect that, on the basis of the facts, representations and
assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the mergers, taken together, will qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

        The obligations of EQT and Merger Sub to effect the merger are also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by EQT of the
following additional conditions:

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Rice set forth in the merger agreement, subject to the
materiality standards set forth in the merger agreement, as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing
date of the merger (except to the extent such representations and warranties are expressly made as of a specific date,
in which case such representations and warranties will be true and correct as of such specific date only), and EQT's
receipt of an officer's certificate from Rice to such effect: 

• performance of, or compliance with, in all material respects all agreements and covenants required to be performed
or complied with under the merger agreement by Rice at or prior to the effective time (and EQT's receipt of an
officer's certificate from Rice to such effect); 

• the absence, since the date of the merger agreement, of any event, change, effect or development that, individually or
in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect with respect to Rice; and

• the receipt by EQT of a written tax opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to EQT and dated as of the closing date, to the effect that, on the basis of the facts, representations and
assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the mergers, taken together, will qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

        As further discussed under the section titled "Risk Factors," neither EQT nor Rice can be certain when, or if, the conditions to
the merger will be satisfied or waived, or that the merger will be completed.

        None of EQT, Rice or Merger Sub may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the merger or for terminating the merger
agreement (as described below), on the failure of any condition set forth above, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure
was caused by such party's breach in any material respect of any provision of the merger agreement.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 162) 

        Rice and EQT may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement before consummating the merger, even after adoption of
the merger agreement proposal by Rice stockholders and approval of the share issuance proposal by EQT shareholders.

        In addition, either EQT or Rice may terminate the merger agreement if:

• any governmental authority having jurisdiction over any party shall have issued any order, decree, ruling or
injunction or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the merger and injunction shall have become final and nonappealable, or if there shall be adopted any law that
permanently makes consummation of the merger illegal or otherwise permanently prohibited (provided that this right
to terminate the merger agreement shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any material covenant
or agreement under the merger agreement has been the cause of or resulted in such injunction or law); 

• subject to certain exceptions, the merger is not consummated by February 19, 2018, subject to one three-month
extension to May 19, 2018, at the election of EQT or Rice, if the only conditions not satisfied at such time relate to
an antitrust law (such date, as may be extended, the "end date") (provided that this right to terminate the merger
agreement shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any material covenant or agreement under the
merger agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before the end date); 

• subject to certain exceptions, there has been a breach of the merger agreement by the other party or there has been a
failure to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement,
which breach or failure to perform (i) if it was continuing to occur on the closing date, would result in a failure of a
condition to close by such breaching party and (2) is incapable of being cured during the time period set forth in the
merger agreement or, if curable, is not cured during the applicable cure period (provided the party seeking to
terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this provision is not then in terminable breach); 

• if the Rice special meeting has concluded without adoption of the merger agreement proposal by Rice stockholders
or if the EQT special meeting has concluded without approval of EQT shareholders of the share issuance proposal;
or 

• prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Rice stockholders or approval of the share issuance by EQT
shareholders, as applicable, the other party (i) makes an adverse recommendation change or (ii) is in material
violation of its non-solicitation obligations.

        Rice may also terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Rice superior
proposal (provided that contemporaneous with such termination Rice tenders a termination fee payment to EQT).

Expenses and Termination Fees Relating to the Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 163) 

        Rice or EQT, as applicable, will be obligated to pay the other party a termination fee of $255 million in the following
circumstances:

• if such party effects an adverse recommendation change or such party commits a material breach of its non-
solicitation obligations; or 

• (i) a competing proposal has been announced, disclosed or otherwise communicated to the Rice board or the EQT
board, as applicable, and not withdrawn by a date that is at least three business days prior to the Rice special meeting
or EQT special meeting, as applicable, or at least three business days prior to the termination of the merger
agreement due to occurrence of the

end date or a terminable breach by Rice or EQT, as applicable, (ii) thereafter, the merger agreement is terminated
because the other party's shareholders fail to adopt the merger agreement or approve the share issuance, as
applicable, or because of the occurrence of the end date or a terminable breach by the other party and (iii) within
twelve months of the termination of the merger agreement, the other party enters into a definitive agreement with a
third party with respect to or consummates a transaction that is a competing proposal with a third party.

        Rice will also be required to pay a termination fee of $255 million if Rice terminates the merger agreement in order to enter
into a superior proposal.

        In addition, unless otherwise entitled to the $255 million termination fee, EQT or Rice will be obligated to pay the other party
an expense reimbursement fee of $67 million if such party's shareholders fail to adopt the merger agreement or approve the share
issuance, as applicable.

        In no event shall either party be entitled to receive more than one termination fee and one expense reimbursement fee. If a
party receives a termination fee, then such party will not be entitled to also receive an expense reimbursement fee, and any payment
of the expense reimbursement fee shall be fully creditable against any subsequent payment of the termination fee.

Specific Performance (see page 164) 

        In addition to any other remedy that may be available to each party, including monetary damages, each of the parties will be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches
of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically its terms and provisions.

Expected Timing of the Merger (see page 148) 

        The merger is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. However, neither EQT nor Rice can predict
the actual date on which the merger will be completed, nor can the parties assure that the merger will be completed, because
completion is subject to conditions beyond each party's control.

Comparison of Rights of Common Shareholders of EQT and Common Stockholders of Rice (see page 186) 

        Rice stockholders receiving shares of EQT common stock in connection with the merger will have different rights once they
become shareholders of EQT due to differences between laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Delaware and
the governing corporate documents of EQT and Rice. These differences are described in more detail under "Comparison of Rights
of Common Shareholders of EQT and Common Stockholders of Rice."

Risk Factors (see page 34) 

        Before voting at the Rice special meeting or the EQT special meeting, you should carefully consider all of the information
contained in or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, as well as the specific factors under the heading
"Risk Factors."

Table of Contents

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

        Adjusted EBITDAX is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by Rice's management and external users of
Rice's consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies.

        Rice defines Adjusted EBITDAX as net (loss) income before noncontrolling interest; interest expense; depreciation, depletion
and amortization; amortization of deferred financing costs; amortization of intangible assets; equity in loss (income) of their joint
ventures; derivative fair value loss (gain), excluding net cash receipts (payments) on settled derivative instruments; gain on
purchase of Marcellus joint venture; acquisition expense; non-cash stock compensation expense; non-cash incentive unit expense;
restricted unit expense; income tax (benefit) expense; loss on extinguishment of debt; write-off of deferred financing costs; (gain)
loss from sale of interest in gas properties; exploration expenses; and other non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDAX is not a
measure of net income as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.

        Rice's management believes Adjusted EBITDAX is a useful measure to the users of Rice's financial statements because it
allows them to more effectively evaluate Rice's operating performance and compare the results of Rice's operations from period to
period and against Rice's peers without regard to Rice's financing methods or capital structure. Rice excludes the items listed above
from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within
Rice's industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets
were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as
determined in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in
understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the
historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. Rice's computations of Adjusted
EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Rice believes that Adjusted EBITDAX is
a widely followed measure of operating performance also used by investors.

(1) The adjustments for the derivative fair value (gains) losses and net cash receipts on settled commodity
derivative instruments have the effect of adjusting net income (loss) for changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments, which are recognized at the end of each accounting period because Rice does not designate
commodity derivative instruments as accounting hedges. This results in reflecting commodity derivative gains
and losses within Adjusted EBITDAX on a cash basis during the period the derivatives settled. 

(2) Represents gain recognized on the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in Rice's Marcellus joint venture. 

(3) The above Adjusted EBITDAX reconciliation deducts the impact of noncontrolling interest attributable to
midstream entities and excludes the elimination of intercompany water revenues between Rice's subsidiaries
and Rice Midstream Partners LP. Included in the above reconciliation is the non-controlling interest
attributable to Rice Energy Operating, LLC, as Rice views their business on a fully diluted basis.

Rice Common Stock 

        As of the close of business on September 25, 2017, the record date for the EQT special meeting, there were approximately
173,832,392 shares of EQT common stock outstanding and approximately 2,211 holders of record of EQT common stock. As of the
close of business on September 21, 2017, the record date, for the Rice special meeting, there were 227,957,481 shares of Rice
common stock outstanding, held by 23 holders of record.

        Because the exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either EQT common stock or Rice common
stock, the market value of the shares of EQT common stock that holders of Rice common stock will have the right to receive on the
date the merger is completed may vary significantly from the market value of the shares of EQT common stock that holders of Rice
common stock would receive if the merger were completed on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. As a result, you
should obtain recent market prices of EQT common stock and Rice common stock prior to voting your shares. See "Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to the Merger."

Dividends 

        EQT has paid a quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share in respect of its common stock for the past several years. Any future
decisions to pay dividends on EQT common stock will be at the discretion of the EQT board and will depend on the financial
condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors that the EQT board may deem relevant. Subject to limited
exceptions, including for EQT's ordinary course quarterly dividends of $0.03 per share, the merger agreement prohibits EQT (unless
consented to in advance by Rice, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) from paying dividends
to holders of EQT common stock until the earlier of the effective time and the termination of the merger agreement in accordance
with its terms.

        Since its initial public offering, Rice has not declared any dividends and does not anticipate declaring or providing any cash
dividends to holders of Rice common stock in the foreseeable future. Subject to limited exceptions, the merger agreement prohibits
Rice (unless consented to in advance by EQT, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) from
paying dividends to holders of Rice common stock until the earlier of the effective time and the termination of the merger
agreement in accordance with its terms.

obtain the required approvals of the EQT shareholders and Rice stockholders, which may have adverse effects on the
business and the stock price of EQT and Rice;

        EQT and Rice caution that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Additional information concerning these and other risk
factors is contained in EQT's and Rice's most recently filed Annual Reports on Form 10-K, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q,
recent Current Reports on Form 8-K and other SEC filings, as such filings may be amended from time to time. All subsequent written and
oral forward-looking statements concerning EQT, Rice, the merger or other matters attributable to EQT or Rice or any person acting on
their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. Neither EQT nor Rice undertakes any obligation to
update publicly any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date hereof.

RISK FACTORS 

        In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the
matters addressed in the section titled "Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," you should carefully consider the
following risk factors before deciding whether to vote for the merger agreement proposal, in the case of Rice stockholders, or for the share
issuance proposal, in the case of EQT shareholders. In addition, you should read and consider the risks associated with each of the
businesses of Rice and EQT because these risks will relate to the combined company following the completion of the merger. Descriptions
of some of these risks can be found in the Annual Reports of EQT and Rice on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016,
and any amendments thereto for each of EQT and Rice, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in each company's subsequently
filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. You should also consider the other information in this document and the other documents incorporated by reference
into this document. See the section titled "Where You Can Find More Information."

Risks Relating to the Merger 

Because the exchange ratio is fixed and the market prices of EQT common stock and Rice common stock may fluctuate, Rice
stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the EQT common stock they will receive on the closing date.

        At the effective time, each share of Rice common stock (other than excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive 0.37 of
a share of EQT common stock and $5.30 in cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes. If applicable, the exchange
ratio will be adjusted appropriately to fully reflect the effect of any stock dividend, subdivision, stock split, reclassification, reorganization
or other similar change with respect to the shares of either EQT common stock or Rice common stock prior to the completion of the
merger. The exchange ratio will not, however, be adjusted for changes in the market price of either EQT common stock or Rice common
stock between the date of signing the merger agreement and the effective time. Accordingly, at the time of the EQT special meeting and at
the time of the Rice special meeting, neither EQT shareholders nor Rice stockholders will know, or be able to determine, the value of EQT
common stock to be issued in connection with the merger. For that reason, the market price of EQT common stock on the date of the EQT
special meeting and the Rice special meeting may not be indicative of the value of EQT common stock that Rice stockholders will receive
upon completion of the merger.

        The market prices of EQT common stock and Rice common stock are subject to general price fluctuations in the market for publicly
traded equity securities and have experienced volatility in the past. Neither EQT nor Rice is permitted to terminate the merger agreement
or re-solicit the vote of EQT shareholders or Rice stockholders, as applicable, solely because of changes in the market prices of either
company's common stock. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions and
changes in the respective businesses, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations of EQT and Rice. Market assessments of the
benefits of the proposed merger and the likelihood that the transactions will be completed, as well as general and industry-specific market
and economic conditions, may also affect market prices of EQT common stock and Rice common stock. Many of these factors are beyond
EQT's and Rice's control. Rice stockholders should obtain current market quotations for shares of EQT common stock and for shares of
Rice common stock.

Table of Contents

The market value of EQT common stock could be negatively affected by risks and conditions that apply to EQT, which may be different
from the risks and conditions applicable to Rice, and EQT shareholders will have different rights than Rice stockholders.

        Following the merger, EQT shareholders and former Rice stockholders will own interests in a combined company operating an
expanded business with more assets and a different mix of liabilities. The business of EQT and its subsidiaries and other companies it may
acquire in the future are different from those of Rice. There is a risk that various factors, conditions and developments that would not
affect the price of Rice common stock could negatively affect the price of EQT common stock. Current EQT shareholders and Rice
stockholders may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company, or may wish to reduce their investment in the combined
company, including in order to comply with institutional investing guidelines, to increase diversification, to track any rebalancing of stock
indices in which EQT common stock is included, to respond to the risk profile of the combined company or to realize a gain. In addition,
if, following the merger, large amounts of EQT common stock are sold, the price of EQT common stock could decline.

        Holders of shares of EQT common stock will have rights as EQT shareholders that differ from the rights they had as Rice
stockholders before the merger. For a detailed comparison of the rights of EQT shareholders to the rights of Rice stockholders, see
"Comparison of Rights of Common Shareholders of EQT and Common Stockholders of Rice."

The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be
satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the merger, could have material and adverse effects on EQT and Rice.

        Completion of the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval by EQT shareholders of the share issuance
proposal and approval by Rice stockholders of the merger agreement proposal, which make the completion and timing of the completion
of the transactions uncertain. See the section titled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger" for a more detailed
discussion. Also, either EQT or Rice may terminate the merger agreement if the merger has not been consummated by February 19, 2018
or, at either party's discretion—if the only conditions to closing that have not been satisfied or waived by that date are those related to the
termination or expiration of any waiting period under the HSR Act or the issuance of an order, decree, ruling, injunction or other action
that is in effect and is restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger—May 19, 2018, except that this
right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any party whose material breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement of such party under the merger agreement resulted in the failure of the transactions to be consummated on or before that
date.

        If the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are not completed, EQT's and Rice's respective ongoing businesses may be
adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the transactions, EQT and Rice will be subject to a
number of risks, including the following:

• EQT and Rice will be required to pay their respective costs relating to the transactions, such as legal, accounting, financial
advisory and printing fees, whether or not the transactions are completed; 

• time and resources committed by EQT's and Rice's management to matters relating to the transactions could otherwise have
been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; 

• the market price of EQT common stock or Rice common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price
reflects a market assumption that the transactions will be completed;

• if the merger agreement is terminated and the Rice board seeks another business combination, Rice stockholders cannot be
certain that Rice will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction agreement on terms equivalent to or more
attractive than the terms agreed to in the merger agreement; and 

• if the merger agreement is terminated and the EQT board seeks another acquisition, EQT shareholders cannot be certain
that EQT will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction as attractive to EQT as the acquisition of Rice.

The merger agreement contains provisions that limit Rice's and EQT's ability to pursue alternatives to the transactions, could
discourage a potential competing acquiror of Rice or EQT from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in specified
circumstances, could require Rice or EQT to pay the other party a termination fee of $255 million.

        The merger agreement contains certain provisions that restrict Rice's and EQT's ability to initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals, or offers regarding, or the making of a competing proposal, engage in any discussions or
negotiations with respect to a competing proposal or furnish any non-public information to any person in connection with a competing
proposal. Further, even if the Rice board or the EQT board changes, withholds, modifies, withdraws or qualifies its recommendation with
respect to the merger agreement proposal or the share issuance proposal, as applicable, unless the merger agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, both parties will still be required to submit the merger agreement proposal and the share issuance proposal, as
applicable, to a vote at the its special meeting. In addition, the other party generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in response to any third-party alternative transaction proposal before a party's board of
directors may change, withhold, modify, withdraw or qualify its recommendation with respect to the merger agreement proposal or the
share issuance proposal, as applicable. In some circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, Rice or EQT will be required to
pay a termination fee of $255 million to the other party. See the sections entitled "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative
Proposals," "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" and "The Merger Agreement—Expenses and Termination
Fees Relating to the Termination of the Merger Agreement."

        These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a
significant portion of Rice or EQT or pursuing an alternative transaction with either from considering or proposing such a transaction,
even if, in the case of an acquisition of Rice, it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share price than the per share price
proposed to be received in the merger or might result in a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner proposing to pay a lower price to
the stockholders of Rice or the shareholders of EQT than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the
$255 million termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.

Rice's executive officers and directors have interests in the transactions that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
Rice stockholders generally.

        When considering the recommendation of the Rice board with respect to the merger, you should be aware that Rice's executive
officers and directors may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of Rice's stockholders more
generally. The Rice board was aware of these interests during its deliberations on the merits of the merger and in deciding to recommend
that Rice stockholders vote for the adoption of the merger agreement at the Rice special meeting.

        Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding restricted stock unit award or performance stock unit award in respect of Rice
common stock will be treated as described in "The Merger—Interests of Certain Rice Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

        See the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "The Merger—Interests of Certain Rice Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger" for a more detailed description of the interests of Rice's executive officers and directors.

Rice and EQT will be subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending, which could adversely affect their business.

        In connection with the pendency of the transactions, it is possible that certain persons with whom Rice and EQT have a business
relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships
with Rice or EQT, as the case may be, as a result of the transactions, which could negatively affect Rice's or EQT's revenues, earnings and
cash flows, as well as the market price of Rice's or EQT's respective common stock, regardless of whether the merger is completed.

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, each of Rice and EQT are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior
to the effective time, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies, including the ability in certain cases
to enter into contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures, as applicable. Such limitations could
negatively affect Rice's and EQT's businesses and operations prior to the completion of the transactions.

The merger is subject to the receipt of approvals, consents or clearances from regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that
could have an adverse effect on EQT or Rice or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the transactions.

        Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental approvals. Although each party has agreed to use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite governmental approvals, there can be no assurance that these approvals will
be obtained and that the other conditions to completing the merger will be satisfied. In addition, the governmental authorities from which
the regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger
or other agreements to be entered into in connection with the merger agreement. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining
regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying or impeding consummation of the transaction or of imposing additional costs or
limitations on EQT or Rice following completion of the merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on EQT or Rice following
completion of the merger. For additional information about the regulatory approvals process, see "The Merger—Regulatory Approvals."

identified as the acquirer under GAAP and reflects adjustments based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets to be acquired
and liabilities to be assumed.

Completion of the merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Rice is a party.

        The completion of the transactions may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Rice is a party. If
EQT and Rice are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the
agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if EQT and Rice are able to negotiate waivers, the
counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Rice.

Risks Relating to EQT After Completion of the Merger 

Following the merger, the market price of EQT common stock may be volatile, and holders of EQT's common stock could lose a
significant portion of their investment due to drops in the market price of EQT's common stock following completion of the
transactions.

        The market price of EQT's common stock may be volatile, and following completion of the merger, shareholders may not be able to
resell their shares of EQT common stock at or above the price at which they acquired the common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
or otherwise due to fluctuations in its market price, including changes in price caused by factors unrelated to EQT's performance or
prospects.

        Specific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for EQT's common stock include, among others, the following:

• changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding EQT's common stock or other
comparable companies; 

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in EQT's revenue stream or future prospects; 

• reaction to public announcements by EQT following the merger; 

• strategic actions taken by EQT or its competitors, such as acquisitions; 

• failure of EQT to achieve the perceived benefits of the merger, including financial results, as rapidly as or to the extent
anticipated by financial or industry analysts; 

• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to EQT's business and operations
or the natural gas industry; 

• changes in tax or accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; 

• adverse conditions in the financial markets or general U.S. or international economic conditions, including those resulting
from war, incidents of terrorism and responses to such events; and 

• sales of EQT common stock by members of EQT's management team or significant shareholders.

If the merger is completed, EQT may not achieve the intended benefits and the transaction may disrupt its current plans or operations.

        There can be no assurance that EQT will be able to successfully integrate Rice's assets or otherwise realize the expected benefits of
the transaction. EQT also may not be able to finance the transaction on attractive terms, which could result in increased costs, dilution to
its shareholders and/or have an adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, EQT's

Table of Contents

business may be negatively impacted following the transaction if it is unable to effectively manage its expanded operations. The
integration will require significant time and focus from EQT's management following the transaction. Additionally, consummating the
merger could disrupt current plans and operations, which could delay the achievement of EQT's strategic objectives.

EQT has a material amount of indebtedness that involves debt service obligations, could expose EQT to interest rate fluctuations and
exposes EQT to the risk of default under its debt obligations and EQT expects to incur more indebtedness in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        EQT has a material amount of indebtedness and debt service requirements. As of June 30, 2017, EQT had approximately $3.3 billion
in long-term indebtedness in the form of outstanding senior unsecured notes. On October 4, 2017, EQT closed an offering of $3.0 billion
of its fixed and floating rate senior notes.

        In addition, EQT expects to incur more indebtedness in connection with the transactions. EQT's material indebtedness could have
important consequences to you, including the following:

• it may limit EQT's ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, debt service requirements and general corporate or other purposes; 

• a material portion of EQT's cash flows will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on EQT's indebtedness,
including indebtedness it may incur in the future, and will not be available for other purposes, including to pay dividends
and make acquisitions; 

• it could limit EQT's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates
and place EQT at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged; 

• it could make EQT more vulnerable to downturns in general economic or industry conditions or in EQT's business, or
prevent EQT from carrying out activities that are important to its growth; 

• it could increase EQT's interest expense if interest rates in general increase because any indebtedness under EQT's senior
unsecured credit facility and floating rate notes will bear interest at floating rates; 

• it could limit EQT's ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities; and 

• it could make it more difficult for EQT to satisfy its obligations with respect to its indebtedness, including under the notes,
and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of EQT's debt instruments, including any financial and other
restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the indentures governing the notes or under the agreements
governing EQT's other indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of EQT's indebtedness
under the senior unsecured credit facility and/or the notes.

        EQT cannot assure you that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available
to EQT under its senior unsecured credit facility or from other debt financing, in an amount sufficient to enable EQT to pay its
indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund its other liquidity needs. If EQT does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to
satisfy its debt service obligations, including payments on the notes, EQT may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as
refinancing or restructuring its indebtedness, selling assets or seeking to raise additional capital, including by issuing equity securities or
securities convertible into equity securities. EQT's ability to restructure or refinance its indebtedness will depend on the capital markets
and its financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of EQT's indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require EQT to
comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict its business operations. EQT's inability to generate sufficient cash flow
to satisfy its debt service

Table of Contents

requirements, including the inability to service the notes, or to refinance its obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have an
adverse effect, which could be material, on its business, financial position and results of operations, as well as on EQT's ability to satisfy
its obligations in respect of the notes. To the extent that EQT will incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risks
associated with EQT's leverage, including its possible inability to service its debt, would increase.

Adverse changes in EQT's credit rating may affect EQT's borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.

        EQT's outstanding debt is periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The credit ratings are based upon EQT's
operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as
relevant to both EQT's industry and the economic outlook. EQT's credit rating may affect the amount of capital EQT can access, as well as
the terms of any financing EQT obtains. Because EQT relies in part on debt financing to fund growth, adverse changes in EQT's credit
rating may have a negative effect on EQT's future growth.

After the merger is completed, Rice stockholders will become shareholders of a Pennsylvania corporation and have their rights as
shareholders governed by EQT's organizational documents and Pennsylvania law.

        Upon consummation of the merger, Rice stockholders will receive EQT common stock that will be governed by EQT's organizational
documents and the PBCL. For a detailed discussion of the differences between rights as a stockholders of Rice and rights as a shareholder
of EQT, see "Comparison of Rights of Common Shareholders of EQT and Common Stockholders of Rice."

EQT is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the transactions.

        The combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the merger and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. While EQT and Rice have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred,
there are many factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the expenses.

Other Risk Factors of EQT and Rice 

        EQT's and Rice's businesses are and will be subject to the risks described above. In addition, EQT and Rice are, and will continue to
be subject to the risks described in EQT's and Rice's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, as
updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, all of which are filed with the SEC and
incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The risks described above and in those filings represent all known
material risks with respect to EQT's and Rice's businesses. See "Where You Can Find More Information" for the location of information

outstanding shares of EQT common stock entitled to vote at the EQT special meeting. For purposes of determining whether there is a
quorum, all shares that are present, including abstentions, will count towards the quorum.

Vote Required 

        The votes required for each proposal are as follows:

        Proposal 1—the share issuance proposal.    The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the share issuance proposal by
holders of EQT's common stock is required to approve the share issuance proposal. Any abstention by an EQT shareholder will have the
same effect as a vote against the share issuance proposal. The failure of any EQT shareholder to submit a vote (e.g., by not submitting a
proxy or not voting in person) will not be counted in determining the votes cast in connection with the share issuance proposal. Because
the share issuance proposal is non-routine, brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary authority to vote on the share
issuance proposal and will not be able to vote on the share issuance proposal absent instructions from the beneficial owner. The failure of a
beneficial owner to provide voting instructions to its broker, bank or other nominee will result in the applicable shares not being counted in
determining the votes cast in connection with the share issuance proposal, and will therefore have no effect on the outcome of the share
issuance proposal.

        Proposal 2—the charter amendment proposal.    The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the charter amendment
proposal by holders of EQT's common stock is required to approve the charter amendment proposal. Abstentions will not be treated as
votes cast and, as a result, any abstention by an EQT shareholder will have no effect on the outcome of the charter amendment proposal.
The failure of any EQT shareholder to submit a vote (e.g., by not submitting a proxy or not voting in person) will not be counted in
determining the votes cast in connection with the charter amendment proposal. Because the charter amendment proposal is non-routine,
brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary authority to vote on the charter amendment proposal and will not be able to
vote on the charter amendment proposal absent instructions from the beneficial owner. The failure of a beneficial owner to provide voting
instructions to its broker, bank or other nominee will result in the applicable shares not being counted in determining the votes cast in
connection with the charter amendment proposal, and will therefore have no effect on the outcome of the charter amendment proposal.

        Proposal 3—the EQT adjournment proposal.    The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the EQT adjournment
proposal by holders of EQT's common stock is required to approve the EQT adjournment proposal. Abstentions will not be treated as
votes cast and, as a result, any abstention will have no effect on the outcome of the EQT adjournment proposal. The failure of any EQT
shareholder to submit a vote (e.g., not submitting a proxy or not voting in person) will not be counted in determining the votes cast in
connection with the EQT adjournment proposal. Because the EQT adjournment proposal is non-routine, brokers, banks and other
nominees do not have discretionary authority to vote on the EQT adjournment proposal and will not be able to vote on the EQT
adjournment proposal absent instructions from the beneficial owner. The failure of a beneficial owner to provide voting instructions to its
broker, bank or other nominee will result in the applicable shares not being counted in determining the votes cast in connection with the
EQT adjournment proposal, and will therefore have no effect on the outcome of the EQT adjournment proposal.

        If shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, the beneficial owner of such shares will receive separate
instructions from his or her broker, bank or other nominee describing how to vote such shares.

        A so-called "broker non-vote" results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy but do not vote on a particular
proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the
beneficial owner of such

shares. EQT and Rice do not expect any broker-non votes at the EQT special meeting or Rice special meeting because the rules applicable
to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered routine,
whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the EQT special meeting and Rice special meeting are considered non-routine. As a result,
no broker will be permitted to vote shares at the EQT special meeting or Rice special meeting without receiving instructions from the
beneficial owner of such shares.

How to Vote 

        EQT shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date may have their shares voted by submitting a proxy or may
vote in person at the EQT special meeting by following the instructions provided on the enclosed proxy card. EQT recommends that EQT
shareholders entitled to vote submit a proxy even if they plan to attend the EQT special meeting.

        EQT shareholders who hold their shares beneficially in "street name" and wish to submit a proxy must provide instructions to the
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee that holds their shares of record as to how to vote their shares with respect to Proposals 1, 2 and 3.
EQT shareholders who hold their shares beneficially and wish to vote in person at the EQT special meeting must obtain proxies issued in
their own names (known as a "legal proxy").

        EQT shareholders of record may submit a proxy in one of three ways or vote in person at the EQT special meeting:

• Internet:  EQT shareholders may submit their proxy over the Internet at the web address shown on their proxy card.
Internet voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on November 8, 2017.
Shareholders will be given an opportunity to confirm that their voting instructions have been properly recorded. EQT
shareholders who submit a proxy this way need not send in their proxy card. 

• Telephone:  EQT shareholders may submit their proxy by calling the toll-free telephone number shown on their proxy card.
Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on November 8, 2017.
Easy-to-follow voice prompts will guide shareholders through the voting and allow them to confirm that their instructions
have been properly recorded. EQT shareholders who submit a proxy this way need not send in their proxy card. 

• Mail:  EQT shareholders may submit their proxy by properly completing, signing, dating and mailing their proxy card in
the postage-paid envelope (if mailed in the United States) included with this joint proxy statement/prospectus. EQT
shareholders who vote this way should mail the proxy card early enough so that it is received before the date of the EQT
special meeting. 

• In Person:  EQT shareholders may vote in person at the EQT special meeting or by sending a representative with an
acceptable proxy that has been signed and dated. Attendance at the EQT special meeting will not, however, in and of itself
constitute a vote or a revocation of a prior proxy.

        EQT shareholders are encouraged to submit a proxy promptly. Each valid proxy received in time will be voted at the EQT special
meeting according to the choice specified, if any. Executed but uninstructed proxies (i.e., proxies that are properly signed, dated and
returned but are not marked to tell the proxies how to vote) will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the EQT board.

        EQT shareholders who hold shares through EQT's Employee Savings Plan will receive a separate voting direction card. The trustee of
the EQT Employee Savings Plan will vote such EQT shareholders' shares in accordance with the instructions on such shareholders'
returned direction cards. If EQT shareholders who hold shares through EQT's Employee Savings Plan do not return a direction card or if
they return a direction card with no instructions, the trustee will vote such EQT shareholders' shares

in proportion to the way other plan participants voted their shares. Please note that the direction cards have an earlier return date than the
proxy cards.

        EQT shareholders who hold shares through EQT's Employee Savings Plan should review their direction card for the date by which
their instructions must be received in order for their shares to be voted.

        In the case of Internet or telephone voting, EQT shareholders who hold shares through EQT's Employee Savings Plan should have
their direction card in hand and retain the card until they have completed the voting process. If EQT shareholders who hold shares through
EQT's Employee Savings Plan vote by Internet or telephone, they do not need to return the direction card by mail.

        Employees of EQT holding restricted shares through the EQT 2014 LTIP will receive a separate voting direction card. The
administrator of the EQT 2014 LTIP (or its designee) will vote his or her restricted shares in accordance with the instructions on their
returned direction cards.

        If employees of EQT holding restricted shares through the EQT 2014 LTIP return a direction card with no instructions, the
administrator or its designee will vote their shares as recommended by the EQT Board. If any such person does not return a direction card,
his/her shares will not be voted. Please note that the direction cards have an earlier return date than the proxy cards. Employees of EQT
holding restricted shares through the EQT 2014 LTIP should review their direction card for the date by which their instructions must be
received in order for their shares to be voted.

        In the case of Internet or telephone voting, employees of EQT holding restricted shares through the EQT 2014 LTIP should have their
direction card in hand and retain the card until they have completed the voting process. If such persons vote by Internet or telephone, they
do not need to return the direction card by mail.

Proxies and Revocation 

        EQT shareholders of record may revoke their proxies at any time before their shares are voted at the EQT special meeting in any of
the following ways:

• sending a written notice of revocation to EQT at 625 Liberty Avenue, Suite 1700, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222,
Attention: Corporate Secretary, which must be received before their shares are voted at the EQT special meeting; 

• properly submitting a new, later-dated proxy card, which must be received before their shares are voted at the EQT special
meeting (in which case only the later-dated proxy is counted and the earlier proxy is revoked); 

• submitting a proxy via the Internet or by telephone at a later date, which must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
November 8, 2017 (in which case only the later-dated proxy is counted and the earlier proxy is revoked); or 

• attending the EQT special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the EQT special meeting will not, however, in and
of itself, constitute a vote or revocation of a prior proxy.

        EQT beneficial owners may change their voting instruction only by submitting new voting instructions to the brokers, banks or other
nominees that hold their shares of record.

Judges of Election 

        The EQT board will select three independent persons to act as judges of election at the EQT special meeting.

Table of Contents

Solicitation of Proxies 

        EQT will pay for the proxy solicitation costs related to the EQT special meeting. In addition to sending and making available these
materials, some of EQT's directors, officers and other employees may solicit proxies by contacting EQT shareholders by telephone, by
mail, by e-mail or in person. EQT shareholders may also be solicited by press releases issued by EQT and/or Rice, postings on EQT's or
Rice's websites and advertisements in periodicals. None of EQT's directors, officers or employees will receive any extra compensation for
their solicitation services. EQT has also retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee currently
estimated to be approximately $25,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. EQT will also reimburse brokers, banks and other
nominees for their expenses in sending proxy solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of EQT common stock and obtaining their
proxies.

Adjournments 

        The EQT special meeting may be adjourned in the absence of a quorum by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the
proposal by holders of EQT's common stock.

        Even if a quorum is present, the EQT special meeting could be adjourned in order to provide more time to solicit additional proxies in
favor of approval of the share issuance proposal if a majority of votes are cast in favor of the EQT adjournment proposal. If after the
adjournment a new record date is set for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to each shareholder of
record entitled to vote at the EQT special meeting.

No Dissenters' Rights 

        Under the PBCL, as well as the governing documents of EQT, the EQT shareholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights in
connection with the merger or the transactions contemplated by the merger.

Other Matters 

        At this time, EQT knows of no other matters to be submitted at the EQT special meeting.

Householding of Special Meeting Materials 

        Unless EQT has received contrary instructions, EQT may send a single copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and notice to
any household at which two or more shareholders reside if EQT believes the shareholders are members of the same family. Each
shareholder in the household will continue to receive a separate proxy card. This process, known as "householding," reduces the volume of
duplicate information received at your household and helps to reduce EQT's expenses.

Questions and Additional Information 

        EQT shareholders may contact EQT's proxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, with any questions about the proposals or how to
vote or to request additional copies of any materials at:

RICE SPECIAL MEETING 

General 

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to Rice stockholders as part of a solicitation of proxies by the Rice board for
use at the Rice special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of such special meeting. This joint proxy statement/prospectus
provides Rice stockholders with information about the Rice special meeting and should be read carefully in its entirety.

Date, Time and Place of the Rice Special Meeting 

        The Rice special meeting will be held on November 9, 2017, at 8:00 a.m., local time, at Rice's executive offices at 2200 Rice Drive,
Canonsburg, PA 15317.

Purposes of the Rice Special Meeting 

        The Rice special meeting is being held to consider and vote upon the following proposals:

• Proposal 1:  to adopt the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, pursuant to which each outstanding share of Rice common stock (other than excluded shares) will be
converted into the right to receive 0.37 of a share of EQT common stock and $5.30 in cash, without interest and subject to
applicable withholding taxes, referred to previously as the merger agreement proposal; 

• Proposal 2:  to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
Rice's named executive officers in connection with the merger, referred to previously as the compensation proposal; and 

• Proposal 3:  to vote to adjourn the Rice special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of
the merger agreement proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of such adjournment to adopt the merger
agreement, referred to previously as the Rice adjournment proposal.

Recommendation of the Rice Board 

        The Rice board unanimously recommends that the Rice stockholders vote:

• Proposal 1:  "FOR" the merger agreement proposal; 

• Proposal 2:  "FOR" the compensation proposal; and 

• Proposal 3:  "FOR" the Rice adjournment proposal.

        The Rice board unanimously determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of Rice's stockholders to enter into the
merger agreement, and unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the merger, and resolved to recommend adoption of the merger agreement by Rice's stockholders and that
the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of Rice's stockholders.

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains important information regarding these proposals and factors that Rice stockholders
should consider when deciding how to cast their votes. Rice stockholders are encouraged to read the entire document carefully, including
the annexes to and documents incorporated by reference into this document, for more detailed information regarding the merger agreement
and the merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

The Compensation Proposal and Interests of Directors 

        In considering the recommendations of the Rice board, Rice stockholders should be aware that some of Rice's directors and executive
officers may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Rice stockholders more generally. For more
information see the section titled "The Merger—Interests of Certain Rice Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

        Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
2010, requires that Rice provide its stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory, (non-binding) basis, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to Rice's named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the compensation table and the related narrative named executive officer compensation
disclosures set forth in "The Merger—Interests of Certain Rice Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger." This vote is commonly
referred to as a "golden parachute say on pay" vote. Accordingly, Rice's stockholders are being provided with the opportunity to cast an
advisory vote on those change of control payments.

        Accordingly, Rice is seeking approval of the following resolution at the Rice special meeting:

"RESOLVED, that Rice's stockholders approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become
payable to Rice's named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K
under the heading "The Merger—Interests of Certain Rice Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" (which disclosure
includes the compensation table and related narrative named executive officer compensation disclosures required pursuant to
Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K)."

        Rice stockholders should note that the compensation proposal is merely an advisory vote which will not be binding on Rice, EQT or
their respective boards of directors. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms,
subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is consummated, the eligibility
of the Rice named executive officers for such payments and benefits will not be affected by the outcome of the advisory vote.

        The proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Rice's named
executive officers in connection with the merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Accordingly, a Rice stockholder may vote to approve one proposal and not the other. Because the vote on the proposal to approve, on an
advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Rice's named executive officers in connection with
the merger is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on Rice or EQT, and the approval of that proposal is not a condition to the
completion of the merger.

Attendance at the Rice Special Meeting 

        Only Rice stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date, beneficial owners as of the close of business on record
date, holders of valid proxies for the Rice special meeting and invited guests of Rice may attend the Rice special meeting.

        All attendees should be prepared to present government-issued photo identification (such as a driver's license or passport) for
admittance. The additional items, if any, that attendees must bring depend on whether they are stockholders of record, beneficial owners or
proxy holders.

• A Rice stockholder who holds shares directly registered in such stockholder's name with Rice's transfer agent, American
Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC (a "stockholder of record"),

who wishes to attend the Rice special meeting in person should bring government-issued photo identification.

• A beneficial owner of Rice common stock who wishes to attend the Rice special meeting in person should bring: 

• government-issued photo identification; and

provided by the broker). 

• A proxy holder who wishes to attend the Rice special meeting in person should bring: 

• government-issued photo identification; 

• the validly executed proxy naming such person as the proxy holder, signed by the Rice stockholder; and 

• proof of the signing stockholder's record ownership as of the record date.

        No cameras, recording equipment or other electronic devices will be allowed in the meeting room. Failure to provide the requested
documents at the door or failure to comply with the procedures for the Rice special meeting may prevent stockholders from being admitted
to the Rice special meeting.

        Rice is able to provide reasonable assistance to help persons with disabilities participate in the Rice special meeting if Rice is notified
in writing in advance of requested accommodations. Please write to Rice's principal executive offices at 2200 Rice Drive, Canonsburg,
Pennsylvania 15317, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

Record Date 

        The record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Rice special meeting is September 21,
2017. Only Rice stockholders who held shares of record at the close of business on September 21, 2017 are entitled to vote at the Rice
special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the Rice special meeting, so long as such shares remain outstanding on the date
of the Rice special meeting.

Outstanding Shares as of Record Date 

        As of the close of business on the record date for the Rice special meeting, there were 227,957,481 shares of Rice common stock
outstanding, held by 23 holders of record and 15,217 shares of Rice preferred stock outstanding held by six holders of record.

        A complete list of registered Rice stockholders entitled to vote at the Rice special meeting will be available for inspection at the
principal place of business of Rice at 2200 Rice Drive, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317, during regular business hours for a period of no
less than 10 days before the Rice special meeting and at the place of the Rice special meeting during the meeting.

Quorum 

        In order for business to be conducted at the Rice special meeting, a quorum must be present. A quorum requires the presence, in
person or by proxy, of holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Rice stock entitled to vote at the Rice special
meeting. For purposes of determining whether there is a quorum, all shares that are present and entitled to vote will count towards the
quorum, including abstentions.

Voting Rights of Holders of Rice Common Stock and Rice Preferred Stock 

        Each outstanding share of Rice common stock will be entitled to one vote on each matter considered at the Rice special meeting; each
1/1000th of an outstanding share of Rice preferred stock will be entitled to one vote on each matter considered at the Rice special meeting.

Vote Required 

        The votes required for each proposal are as follows:

• Proposal 1—the merger agreement proposal.  The affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting power of the
outstanding shares of Rice stock, in person or by proxy, entitled to vote on the merger agreement proposal is required to
adopt the merger agreement proposal. The failure of any Rice stockholder to submit a vote (e.g., by not submitting a proxy
or not voting in person) and any abstention by a Rice stockholder will have the same effect as a vote "against" the merger
agreement proposal. Because the merger agreement proposal is non-routine, brokers, banks and other nominees do not have
discretionary authority to vote on the merger agreement proposal, and will not be able to vote on the merger agreement
proposal absent instructions from the beneficial owner. 

• Proposal 2—the compensation proposal.  The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of
Rice stock, present in person or represented by proxy at the Rice special meeting and entitled to vote on the compensation
proposal, is required to approve the compensation proposal. Abstentions will be considered shares present and entitled to
vote and will have the same effect as votes "against" the compensation proposal. Brokers, banks and other nominees do not
have discretionary authority to vote on the compensation proposal and will not be able to vote on the compensation
proposal. While the Rice board intends to consider the vote resulting from this proposal, the vote is advisory only and
therefore not binding on Rice or EQT, and, if the proposed merger with EQT is approved by Rice stockholders and
consummated, the compensation will be payable even if the compensation proposal is not approved. 

• Proposal 3—the Rice adjournment proposal.  The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the
shares of Rice stock, present in person or represented by proxy at the Rice special meeting and entitled to vote on the Rice
adjournment proposal, is required to approve the Rice adjournment proposal. Abstentions will be considered shares present
and entitled to vote and will have the same effect as a votes "against" the Rice adjournment proposal. Brokers, banks and
other nominees do not have discretionary authority to vote on the Rice adjournment proposal and will not be able to vote
on the Rice adjournment proposal absent instructions from the beneficial owner.

        If shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, the beneficial owner of such shares will receive separate
instructions from his or her broker, bank or other nominee describing how to vote such shares.

        A so-called "broker non-vote" results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy but do not vote on a particular
proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the
beneficial owner of such shares. EQT and Rice do not expect any broker non-votes at the EQT special meeting or Rice special meeting
because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals
that are considered routine, whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the EQT special meeting and Rice special meeting are
considered non-routine. As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote shares at the EQT special meeting or Rice special meeting without
receiving instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares.

How to Vote 

        Rice stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date may have their shares voted by submitting a proxy or may
vote in person at the Rice special meeting by following the instructions provided on the enclosed proxy card. Rice recommends that Rice
stockholders entitled to vote submit a proxy even if they plan to attend the Rice special meeting.

        Rice stockholders who hold their shares beneficially in "street name" and wish to submit a proxy must provide instructions to the
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee that holds their shares of record as to how to vote their shares with respect to Proposals 1, 2 and 3.
Rice stockholders who hold their shares beneficially and wish to vote in person at the Rice special meeting must obtain a "legal proxy."

        Rice stockholders of record may submit a proxy in one of three ways or vote in person at the Rice special meeting:

• Internet:  Rice stockholders may submit their proxy over the Internet at the web address shown on their proxy card.
Internet voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on November 8, 2017.
Stockholders will be given an opportunity to confirm that their voting instructions have been properly recorded. Rice
stockholders who submit a proxy this way should NOT send in their proxy card. 

• Telephone:  Rice stockholders may submit their proxy by calling the toll-free telephone number shown on their proxy card.
Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on November 8, 2017.
Rice stockholders who submit a proxy this way should NOT send in their proxy card. 

• Mail:  Rice stockholders may submit their proxy by properly completing, signing, dating and mailing their proxy card in
the postage-paid envelope (if mailed in the United States) included with this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Rice
stockholders who vote this way should mail the proxy card early enough so that it is received before the date of the Rice
special meeting. 

• In Person:  Rice stockholders may vote in person at the Rice special meeting or by sending a representative with an
acceptable proxy that has been signed and dated. Attendance at the Rice special meeting will not, however, in and of itself
constitute a vote or a revocation of a prior proxy.

        Rice stockholders are encouraged to submit a proxy promptly. Each valid proxy received in time will be voted at the Rice special
meeting according to the choice specified, if any. Executed but uninstructed proxies (i.e., proxies that are properly signed, dated and
returned but are not marked to tell the proxies how to vote) will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Rice board.

Proxies and Revocation 

        Rice stockholders of record may revoke their proxies at any time before their shares are voted at the Rice special meeting in any of
the following ways:

• sending a written notice of revocation to Rice at 2200 Rice Drive, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317, Attention: Corporate
Secretary, which must be received before their shares are voted at the Rice special meeting; 

• properly submitting a new, later-dated proxy card, which must be received before their shares are voted at the Rice special
meeting (in which case only the later-dated proxy is counted and the earlier proxy is revoked);

November 8, 2017 (in which case only the later-dated proxy is counted and the earlier proxy is revoked); or 

• attending the Rice special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Rice special meeting will not, however, in and
of itself, constitute a vote or revocation of a prior proxy.

        Rice beneficial owners may change their voting instruction by submitting new voting instructions to the brokers, banks or other
nominees that hold their shares of record or by requesting a "legal proxy" from such broker, bank or other nominee and voting in person at
the Rice special meeting.

Inspector of Election 

        The Rice board has appointed a representative of Corporate Election Services to act as the inspector of election at the Rice special
meeting.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        Rice will pay for the proxy solicitation costs related to the Rice special meeting. In addition to sending and making available these
materials, some of Rice's directors, officers and other employees may solicit proxies by contacting Rice stockholders by telephone, by
mail, by e-mail or in person. Rice stockholders may also be solicited by press releases issued by Rice and/or EQT, postings on Rice's or
EQT's websites and advertisements in periodicals. None of Rice's directors, officers or employees will receive any extra compensation for
their solicitation services. Rice has also retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee expected not to
exceed $75,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Rice will also reimburse brokers, banks and other nominees for their expenses in
sending proxy solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of Rice common stock and obtaining their proxies.

Adjournments 

        The Rice special meeting may be adjourned by the chairman of the Rice special meeting or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority in voting power of Rice stock represented at the Rice special meeting in person or by proxy, regardless of whether there is a
quorum, without further notice other than by an announcement made at the Rice special meeting. In the case that a quorum is not present
at the Rice special meeting, or in the case that a quorum is present at the Rice special meeting but there are not sufficient votes at the time
of the Rice special meeting to adopt the merger agreement, then the chairman of the Rice special meeting has the power to adjourn the
Rice special meeting, or, alternatively, Rice stockholders may be asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn the Rice special meeting in order
to permit the further solicitation of proxies.

        If the adjournment is for more than 30 days or if after the adjournment a new record date is set for the adjourned meeting, a notice of
the adjourned meeting must be given to each Rice stockholder of record entitled to vote at the Rice special meeting.

Appraisal Rights 

        Rice stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, provided they satisfy the special criteria and
conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Rice common stock held by stockholders that do not vote for approval of the merger and
make a demand for appraisal in accordance with Delaware law will not be converted into EQT common stock, but will be converted into
the right to receive from the combined company consideration determined in accordance with Delaware law.

THE MERGER 

        This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the material aspects of the proposed merger. This section may not
contain all of the information that is important to you. You should carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus and the documents
incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the full text of the merger agreement, a copy of which is
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A, for a more complete understanding of the proposed merger and the
transactions related thereto. In addition, important business and financial information about each of EQT and Rice is included in or
incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is included in the annexes hereto. See the section titled "Where
You Can Find More Information."

Effects of the Merger 

        Upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing, on the closing date, Merger Sub, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
EQT formed for the purpose of effecting the merger, will merge with and into Rice. Rice will be the surviving company in the merger. At
the effective time, each share of Rice common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than excluded
shares) will be converted into the right to receive 0.37 of a share of EQT common stock, with cash paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional
shares of EQT common stock, and $5.30 in cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes. In addition, Rice will take
all actions as may be necessary so that at the effective time, each Rice outstanding restricted stock unit award or performance stock unit
award in respect of Rice common stock will be treated as described in "The Merger—Interests of Certain Rice Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger." Following the effective time, EQT and Rice expect that Rice will merge with and into a wholly owned limited
liability company subsidiary of EQT, with the limited liability company subsidiary surviving the second merger as an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of EQT.

Background of the Merger 

        The industries in which EQT and Rice operate are dynamic and evolving technologically and structurally. Therefore, the boards of
directors and senior management teams of EQT and Rice regularly review their respective company's performance, future growth
prospects and overall strategic direction and consider potential opportunities to strengthen their respective businesses and enhance
shareholder value. For each company, these reviews have included consideration of investments, diversification into new basins, purchases
and sales of assets and businesses, joint ventures, spin-offs, initial public offerings of subsidiaries, and potential strategic business
combinations and other transactions with third parties that would further their respective strategic objectives and ability to create
shareholder value.

        In actively managing EQT's portfolio of assets, the EQT board and management team have taken decisive steps to unlock shareholder
value with respect to both EQT's upstream and midstream assets. Actions relating to EQT's midstream assets taken to increase shareholder
value include:

• July 2012: EQT completed the initial public offering of EQM. EQT received $302 million of gross proceeds from the
offering. EQM was formed to impart a higher level of transparency in the value of EQT's midstream business, as well as to
provide EQT with access to a source of low-cost capital, while at the same time maintaining detailed control of when,
where, and how to build and operate required midstream infrastructure. EQM also provided a platform to pursue and
execute third-party midstream projects. 

• July 2013: EQT sold its Sunrise Pipeline to EQM for $650 million. 

• December 2013: EQT sold its natural gas utility business, Equitable Gas Company, LLC, for $740 million in cash and
$174 million in other assets. 

• May 2014: EQT sold its Jupiter Gathering System business to EQM for $1.2 billion 

• March 2015: EQT sold its Northern West Virginia Marcellus Gathering System business to EQM for $926 million.

• May 2015: EQT completed the initial public offering of EQGP. EQT received $714 million of gross proceeds from the
offering. EQGP owns the general partner interest, incentive distribution rights, and 21.8 million limited partner units of
EQM. EQGP was formed to provide greater transparency in the value of EQT's interests, primarily the incentive
distribution rights, in EQM. EQT's 90% ownership interest in EQGP is a substantial and rapidly growing source of cash
flow. 

• October—December 2016: EQT sold its remaining midstream assets to EQM and a third-party for $350 million.

        These transactions have illuminated and allowed EQT to realize significant value. However, the success of these transactions has
highlighted at times an apparent disparity in value between EQT on a consolidated basis and the valuation implied by EQT's midstream
subsidiaries. EQT regularly reviews this sum-of-the-parts discount and is committed to developing a plan to address it by the end of 2018.
In addition, when evaluating strategic transactions, EQT seeks to ensure that a potential transaction does not impair its ability to address
the sum-of-the-parts discount, and considers the relative valuation of counterparties to determine if the proposed transaction is accretive to
EQT's net asset value.

        In the exploration and production business, a key component of EQT's success in recent years has been the strategic decision to focus
its activities on its core Marcellus play, reflected in EQT's January 2012 announcement that it would suspend development of its Huron
assets in favor of investing in its higher return Marcellus assets, which followed a similar decision made in December 2010 to suspend
development of EQT's CBM assets in Virginia. Since that time, EQT has pursued a consolidation strategy of seeking acquisitions of assets
in the Marcellus play that complement EQT's existing portfolio geographically, geologically and operationally. Recent examples of this
consolidation strategy include EQT's acquisition of approximately 60,000 Marcellus acres in two simultaneous transactions announced on
October 25, 2016 for a total purchase price of $697 million (collectively, the "Marcellus Acreage Acquisition") and EQT's $523 million
cash acquisition of 53,400 core net Marcellus acres from Stone Energy announced on February 9, 2017 (the "Stone Energy Transaction").
EQT's consolidation strategy, combined with continued improvements in operational efficiency, has enabled EQT to deliver enhanced
development and productivity in its high-return Marcellus play while achieving a 26% compounded annual sales volume growth from
2013 through 2016.

        As part of its upstream consolidation strategy, EQT closely monitors and evaluates the activities of other industry participants in the
southwestern Appalachian Basin, including strategic transactions undertaken by such participants. In this regard, EQT has noted an
accelerating trend of industry-wide consolidation in the Appalachian Basin, including the acquisition by Vantage Energy ("Vantage") in
May 2016 of certain Marcellus and Utica assets of Alpha Natural Resources for $339.5 million (the "Alpha Acquisition") and Rice's
acquisition of Vantage announced in September 2016 for $2.7 billion (the "Vantage Acquisition"). Prior to the transactions, EQT had
viewed Vantage, Rice and Alpha's Marcellus and Utica assets as key potential acquisition targets.

        Following the Alpha Acquisition and the Vantage Acquisition, EQT's view was that the number of remaining consolidation
opportunities in EQT's core areas had narrowed considerably, with Rice having materially expanded its footprint in EQT's core operating
area, thereby becoming a uniquely attractive and complementary potential business combination for EQT. Among other potential
synergies, EQT noted the opportunity such a combination could create for a significant increase in the average lateral lengths of future
Marcellus wells, more efficient development given the companies' significant contiguity, and a variety of cost savings in both the upstream
and midstream businesses. EQT also reached the conclusion that, in light of the scarcity of remaining potential consolidation opportunities
and the unique synergy opportunities presented by a potential combination with Rice, a combination of Rice with a third party would
materially limit the remaining scope of strategic consolidation opportunities available for EQT to pursue in its core areas, which in turn
could cause EQT's cost structure to become less competitive relative to other industry participants with more consolidated positions. These
and other factors considered by the EQT board in its decision to approve

and recommend the merger are described in more detail in "—Recommendation of the EQT Board and Reasons for the Merger."

        In June of 2015, representatives of EQT contacted Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz ("Wachtell Lipton") to assist EQT in considering a
potential transaction with Rice. Among other things, Wachtell Lipton over the next several weeks worked with representatives of EQT to
evaluate potential transaction structures and provided EQT with a preliminary due diligence memorandum based on publicly available
information regarding Rice.

        In July of 2015, after the parties had executed a mutual confidentiality agreement, Daniel J. Rice IV, Chief Executive Officer of Rice,
and Robert F. Vagt, the Chairman of the Rice board, along with other members of the Rice management team met with David L. Porges,
the Chairman and then-Chief Executive Officer of EQT and certain other members of the EQT management team, to discuss general
industry matters. During this meeting, the parties informally discussed the potential benefits of a strategic business combination between
Rice and EQT, but the matter was not pursued further by either party as neither party believed it to be likely that mutually acceptable
transaction terms would be agreed at that time.

        On April 6, 2016, Mr. Rice met with the chief executive officer of a publicly traded independent exploration and production company
("Company A") and Company A's financial advisor, at the request of Company A. The chief executive officer of Company A inquired as
to whether Rice would be interested in considering a combination of Rice and Company A. Mr. Rice replied that Rice would be open to
hearing what Company A or its financial advisor might propose. Mr. Rice promptly advised members of the Rice board of his discussions
with Company A.

        On April 18, 2016, Mr. Rice met with the chief executive officer of another publicly traded independent exploration and production
company ("Company B"), at the request of Company B. The chief executive officer of Company B also inquired about whether Rice
would be interested in considering a combination of Rice and Company B. Mr. Rice similarly replied that Rice would be open to hearing
what Company B might propose. Mr. Rice promptly advised members of the Rice board of his discussions with Company B.

        On May 10, 2016, at the request of EQT, Mr. Rice met with Mr. Porges to discuss general industry matters. During the course of the
conversation, Mr. Porges suggested that the two companies should more substantively revisit the conversation from the previous year
concerning a strategic business combination. Mr. Rice indicated that Rice would be open to hearing what EQT might propose. Mr. Rice
promptly advised members of the Rice board of his discussions with Mr. Porges.

        On May 12, 2016, Mr. Rice met again with the chief executive officer of Company B, as well as the chief operating officer and chief
financial officer of Company B, to further discuss generally a combination of Rice and Company B. Shortly thereafter, Company B
entered into a significant alternative transaction and discussions between Rice and Company B ceased.

        On May 13, 2016, representatives of EQT contacted Citi to serve as EQT's financial advisor in connection with the potential
acquisition of Rice.

        On May 19, 2016, Rice entered into a confidentiality agreement with EQT and thereafter Rice and EQT engaged in reciprocal due
diligence.

        Also on May 19, 2016, representatives of EQT instructed Wachtell Lipton to begin refreshing its due diligence and transaction
structure review with respect to Rice.

        On May 20, 2016, members of Rice management contacted Barclays and Vinson & Elkins, LLP ("Vinson & Elkins") to assist Rice in
considering the potential combinations with EQT and Company A, as well as other alternative counterparties.

        On May 24, 2016, members of Rice management met with representatives of Barclays to discuss the preferred manner for evaluating
the interest of EQT, Company A and other parties in potential combination transactions.

        On June 9, 2016, Mr. Rice met with Mr. Porges and Robert J. McNally, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of EQT, to
further discuss generally a combination of Rice and EQT.

        On June 14, 2016, the Rice board held a telephonic meeting. Mr. Rice updated the Rice board regarding discussions that he had had
with potential counterparties to a combination transaction, including the expression of interest by EQT, Company A and Company B.
Mr. Rice indicated that, while Rice is not for sale, given the interest expressed by third parties, it was the recommendation of management
to establish a targeted process for a potential transaction as opposed to continuing only one-on-one discussions with companies that had
affirmatively expressed interest. Members of the Rice board asked questions pertaining to management's view of the current and expected
long-term valuation of Rice and whether pursuing a potential transaction was appropriate at this time. Mr. Rice provided insight into Rice's
valuation, speaking to, among other things, Rice's net asset value and discounted cash flow valuation, as well as the near-term discounts to
projected cash flows reflected in the current trading price of Rice common stock. Mr. Rice also explained the current stage of maturity of
the Appalachian Basin and the potential efficiencies and financial benefits that could result from consolidation in that region. The Rice
Board engaged Mr. Rice and management on these matters and discussed the benefits of participating in a consolidating environment at a
time of financial and operational strength as opposed to being forced into consolidation at a time of weakness. The Rice board discussed
the benefits of pursuing a targeted process as opposed to a more expansive process, including confidentiality, likelihood of consummation
and workload on management. Mr. Rice recommended pursuing a process with six counterparties developed by management and Barclays
following an evaluation of 20 potential counterparties. Thereafter, the Rice board discussed the manner in which potential counterparties
would be contacted, recommending Mr. Rice continue engagement with EQT and Company A directly.

        On June 15, 2016, Mr. Rice contacted the chief executive officer of Company A to assess Company A's continued interest in a
strategic combination of Rice and Company A. Mr. Rice advised that Rice expected to discuss alternative transactions with other publicly
traded exploration and production companies and had engaged Barclays to assist Rice with the process. The chief executive officer of
Company A indicated that Company A remained interested in exploring a potential business combination with Rice. Mr. Rice advised that
Barclays would deliver a form of confidentiality agreement for Company A's consideration.

        Over the next several days, representatives of Barclays contacted four other potential publicly traded exploration and production
counterparties to gauge their interest in a business combination with Rice. Two of the potential counterparties declined the opportunity and
a third requested more time while it completed its own portfolio assessment but ultimately never reengaged. The fourth ("Company C")
indicated to Barclays that it was interested in considering the opportunity. Barclays provided Company C with a form of confidentiality
agreement for Company C's consideration.

        On June 23, 2016, Rice entered into a confidentiality agreement with Company A and thereafter engaged in reciprocal due diligence
with Company A.

        On June 28, 2016, Rice entered into a confidentiality agreement with Company C and thereafter engaged in reciprocal due diligence
with Company C.

        On July 5, 2016, Mr. Rice, together with Grayson T. Lisenby, the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Rice, met with
Messrs. Porges and McNally, as well as Steven T. Schlotterbeck, then President of EQT, and Randall L. Crawford, then Senior Vice
President of EQT. During this meeting, Mr. Porges advised that EQT management was prepared to recommend to the EQT board an all-
stock business combination transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.33 of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common
stock, which implied a value of $26.18 per share of Rice common stock at EQT's most recent closing stock price. Mr. Porges indicated that
EQT was open to Rice having representation on the EQT board after closing. Mr. Porges advised that EQT's next board meeting was
July 13, 2016 and requested a response prior to that meeting. Mr. Porges further advised that EQT wanted to move quickly towards
executing a definitive merger agreement. Mr. Rice advised that for Rice to evaluate EQT's proposal, Rice needed certain due diligence
information from EQT, and Mr. Porges agreed to provide that information.

        On July 6, 2016, the Rice board held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Vinson & Elkins and Barclays were also present at the
meeting. Mr. Rice updated the Rice board about the review of potential strategic transactions, noting that Barclays and Rice management
had contacted five potential counterparties in addition to EQT, that EQT, Company A and Company C had each entered into
confidentiality agreements with Rice and that diligence was ongoing with all three potential counterparties. Mr. Rice then summarized his
meeting with EQT from the previous day, including EQT's indication of interest in an all-stock business combination transaction at an
exchange ratio of 0.33 of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock and EQT's desire to move quickly. Mr. Rice
advised the Rice board that EQT's indication of interest was roughly a 18% premium to Rice's stock price and was of interest, but that
additional diligence on EQT's business was required and was ongoing. Representatives of Vinson & Elkins then reviewed with the Rice
board its fiduciary duties with respect to EQT's proposal and the consideration of alternative transactions. Representatives of Barclays
provided the Rice board with information on EQT and a preliminary financial overview of the EQT proposal, cautioning that additional
due diligence materials were required from EQT before Barclays would be able to make any recommendations to the Rice board. Barclays
then discussed the other potential counterparties that had been contacted and advised that those counterparties were expected to provide
indications of interest by the end of the following week. Extensive discussion by the Rice board then ensued. Following this discussion,
the Rice board authorized management to continue to work with Barclays on evaluating the EQT proposal and to provide the other
potential counterparties with information to enable them to provide an indication of interest by the end of the following week.

        Following the Rice board meeting and continuing through July 12, 2016, members of Rice management and representatives of
Barclays reviewed due diligence information provided by EQT.

        On July 12, 2016, the Rice board held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Vinson & Elkins and Barclays were also present at the
meeting. Mr. Rice updated the Rice board on the progress made with the due diligence materials provided by EQT. Mr. Rice further
advised that he expected some indication as to Company A's interest later in the week. Representatives of Barclays then updated the Rice
board on the process to date, including the potential counterparties that had been contacted and their responses, a list of other potential
counterparties that had not been contacted and the rationale for not doing so. Barclays advised that Company C had been provided with
diligence materials but had not actively engaged in discussions with either Barclays or Rice management. Representatives of Barclays
provided the Rice board with a preliminary financial overview of the EQT proposal and a range of potential counterproposals. Extensive
discussion by the Rice board then ensued. Following this discussion, the Rice board authorized management to make a counterproposal to
EQT of an exchange ratio of 0.37 of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock, which implied a value of $28.47
per share of Rice common stock at EQT's then-trading stock price and a premium of approximately 26% to Rice's stock price. Later that
afternoon, Mr. Rice contacted Mr. McNally and delivered the counterproposal.

        On July 13, 2016, the EQT board held a regularly scheduled meeting at which representatives of EQT management were also present.
At this meeting, members of EQT management provided the EQT board with a detailed review of Rice and the strategic and financial
considerations with respect to a potential business combination with Rice, as well as the current status of discussions with respect thereto.
Following discussion, the EQT board authorized and instructed EQT management to continue discussions with Rice with respect to the
potential transaction on the terms that EQT management had described to the EQT board.

        On July 14, 2016, Mr. McNally contacted Mr. Rice and advised that the EQT board had met the previous day and was supportive of
the transaction, but EQT was not comfortable at an exchange ratio that exceeded its initial proposal of 0.33 of a share of EQT common
stock for each share of Rice common stock.

        On July 15, 2016, Company A delivered to Rice a written indication of interest proposing an all-stock transaction at a 10% to 15%
premium to Rice's stock price. Rice management promptly delivered Company A's indication of interest to the members of the Rice board.

        On July 17, 2016, the Rice board held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Vinson & Elkins and Barclays were also present at the
meeting. Mr. Rice updated the Rice board on Company A's indication of interest. In response to questions from the Rice board,
representatives of Barclays and management noted that Company A was much smaller than EQT, unlike EQT was not investment grade
and, at the high end of the proposed premium range, Rice stockholders would own more of the combined company than Company A's
stockholders. Mr. Rice noted that a variety of governance-related matters would have to be worked out between the parties.
Representatives of Barclays also noted that additional diligence of Company A would be necessary to assess value. After discussion, the
Rice board authorized management to request due diligence materials from Company A and to continue to evaluate Company A's
proposal. Mr. Rice next updated the Rice board on the status of discussions with EQT, including the reaffirmation of its proposal of 0.33 of
a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock. After discussion, the Rice board authorized management to make a
new proposal to EQT of 0.35 of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock, which implied a value of $26.45 per
share of Rice common stock at EQT's then-trading stock price.

        On July 19, 2016, Mr. Rice met with Mr. McNally and put forth Rice's counterproposal of 0.35 of a share of EQT common stock for
each share of Rice common stock. The following morning, Mr. McNally called Mr. Rice and advised that EQT would not respond to the
Rice counterproposal until after EQT's earnings announcement on July 28, 2016.

        Between July 20, 2016 and August 9, 2016, EQT's stock price declined from $75.08 per share to $68.86 per share, while Rice's stock
price increased from $21.28 per share to $24.58 per share. The trading price of Company A's stock traded similarly to EQT's stock during
this period. During this period, Rice continued to engage in due diligence reviews with both EQT and Company A. In late July, Company
C confirmed to Barclays that it was not in a position to make a proposal to Rice.

        On August 1, 2016, the Rice board held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Vinson & Elkins and Barclays were also present at
the meeting. Representatives of Barclays updated the Rice board on the status of discussions with EQT and Company A and noted that
Company C had declined to continue its evaluation of a transaction with Rice.

        Mr. Rice spoke with Mr. McNally on August 5, 2016 and communicated by email with Mr. Porges on August 9, 2016, with the
respective managements noting that a transaction involving a meaningful premium for Rice stockholders was becoming increasingly
difficult.

        On August 24, 2016, members of Rice management met with members of EQT management to discuss Rice's operations.

        Given the trading prices of Rice's stock relative to EQT's stock (which eliminated the implied premium in EQT's prior proposal) and
Company A's stock (which resulted in Rice being the larger company), discussions between Rice, EQT and Company A ceased in late
August 2016.

        On September 26, 2016, Rice announced the Vantage Acquisition.

        On October 25, 2016, EQT announced the Marcellus Acreage Acquisition.

        On October 27, 2016, EQT announced that Mr. Schlotterbeck would replace Mr. Porges as Chief Executive Officer of EQT, following
the filing of EQT's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Mr. Porges would remain the Chairman of the EQT
board.

        On February 9, 2017, EQT announced the Stone Energy Transaction.

        On February 21, 2017, Mr. McNally sent an email to Mr. Rice congratulating him on Rice's Vantage acquisition and on March 8,
2017, Mr. Rice and Mr. McNally met. Mr. McNally advised Mr. Rice that EQT continued to believe in the industrial logic of consolidation
in the Marcellus and Utica and inquired whether Rice would be interested in reevaluating a potential business combination with EQT.
Mr. Rice acknowledged the benefits of consolidation, including driving operational

efficiencies, improved well results and cost savings, and promised to consider Mr. McNally's invitation to reengage in discussions.
Mr. Rice informed Mr. McNally that Rice was in the process of evaluating, and quickly preparing for, a potential initial public offering of
its limited partner interests and incentive distribution rights in Rice Midstream Partners LP ("RMP"), and that Rice would not wish to
delay this process. Mr. Rice promptly advised members of the Rice board of his discussions with Mr. McNally and discussed with
Mr. Vagt whether to reengage with EQT.

        On March 22, 2017, Mr. Rice called Mr. McNally to indicate that Rice would reengage in discussions.

        On April 13, 2017, Rice confidentially submitted to the SEC a draft registration statement on Form S-1 for a contemplated initial
public offering of Rice Midstream GP LP ("RMGP"), the owner of all of Rice's limited partner interests and incentive distribution rights in
RMP.

        At a meeting of the EQT board held on April 19, 2017 at which representatives of EQT management and Wachtell Lipton were
present, the EQT board and EQT management discussed, among other things, strategic acquisition opportunities that might be available
for EQT to pursue, including the potential acquisition of Rice. Members of the EQT board and management noted that Rice represented a
uniquely compelling acquisition opportunity given the synergies that would likely result from the contiguous and complementary nature of
Rice's asset base with EQT's. Following this discussion, the EQT board authorized and instructed EQT management to further explore
whether an opportunity existed to reach agreement with Rice with respect to a business combination transaction on mutually acceptable
terms. Messrs. Schlotterbeck and McNally indicated that they would keep the EQT board apprised of all material developments with
respect to the transaction; in that regard, Mr. Schlotterbeck regularly provided updates to and solicited input from other members of the
EQT board throughout the negotiating process that followed.

        In the several weeks following April 19, 2017, representatives of EQT began a detailed due diligence review of Rice based on both
public and nonpublic information regarding Rice and began a detailed evaluation of potential transaction structures.

        On April 24, 2017, Mr. Rice met with Messrs. Schlotterbeck and McNally to discuss next steps. Messrs. Schlotterbeck and McNally
indicated that they would make a formal proposal within two weeks. Later that day, EQT and Rice executed an updated confidentiality
letter agreement that replaced the confidentiality letter agreement of May 19, 2016 covering the same subject.

        On May 4, 2017, Mr. McNally met with Mr. Rice and advised that EQT was willing to propose an all-stock transaction at an
exchange ratio of 0.43 of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock, which implied a value of $25.02 per share
of Rice common stock at EQT's then-trading stock price of $58.19 per share, reflecting a premium of approximately 16% to Rice's then-
trading stock price of $21.61 and an enterprise value multiple of approximately 6.9x Rice's estimated 2018E EBITDAX as adjusted by
EQT management (as defined in "—Certain EQT Unaudited Prospective Financial and Operating Information"). Mr. Rice requested that
EQT submit a formal, written proposal to the Rice board.

        On May 8, 2017, EQT delivered a letter containing non-binding indication of interest to the Rice board, indicating a willingness to
acquire Rice in an all-stock transaction at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.43 of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common
stock, which implied a value of $25.03 per share of Rice common stock at EQT's then-trading stock price of $58.22 per share, reflecting a
premium of approximately 15% to Rice's then-trading stock price of $21.84 and an enterprise value multiple of approximately 6.9x Rice's
estimated 2018E EBITDAX as adjusted by EQT management. Mr. Rice promptly communicated EQT's indication of interest to members
of the Rice board and delivered EQT's letter to each member of the Rice board.

        On May 10, 2017, Mr. Rice called Mr. McNally to advise him that Rice had engaged Barclays and Vinson & Elkins to evaluate EQT's
proposal. Mr. Rice noted that as part of the transaction, Rice would request three or four seats on the combined company board. Mr. Rice
further advised that it was important that Rice establish a retention program to ensure that its employees would remain with

the company through closing. Mr. McNally responded that he would take these requests to the EQT board.

        On May 21, 2017, the Rice board held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Vinson & Elkins and Barclays were also present at
the meeting. The Rice board discussed the recent conversation between Messrs. Rice and McNally. Representatives of Vinson & Elkins
reviewed with the Rice board its fiduciary duties with respect to EQT's proposal. Representatives of Barclays provided the Rice board with
information on EQT and preliminary financial perspectives regarding EQT's proposal and potential counterproposal ranges.
Representatives of Barclays also provided the Rice board with financial analyses of five additional potential acquirers, including Company
A, Company B and Company C. Specifically, with respect to Company A, representatives of Barclays noted that the combination of Rice's
acquisition of Vantage and the relative stock performance of Rice and Company A had resulted in Rice having grown to be 150% larger
than Company A on a market capitalization basis, which would mean that an alternative transaction with Company A would involve Rice
stockholders having a majority of the shares of the combined company. In 2016, Company A had proposed to acquire Rice at a 10 to 15%
premium to Rice's stock price. In contrast, the Rice board concluded that at best, a transaction with Company A in May or June 2017
would have been at no premium to Rice's stock price and likely at a premium to the Company A stock price (and thus, at a discount to
Rice's stock price). As such, a strategic transaction with Company A was not appealing to the Rice board. With respect to Company B,
representatives of Barclays noted that Company B had completed a major acquisition less than one year ago and the Rice board concluded
that Company B was unlikely to entertain another significant strategic transaction at this time. Moreover, even if Company B was
interested, an all-stock transaction at premiums equal to or higher than the current EQT proposal would likewise result in Rice
stockholders owning a majority of the combined company, and the Rice board concluded that such a transaction was highly unlikely to be
achieved. And with Company C, representatives of Barclays noted that a transaction at the same or higher premium than the premium
implied in the EQT proposal would be meaningfully dilutive to Company C's 2018 estimated cash flow per share, based upon FactSet
consensus estimates. Moreover, the Rice board considered the fact that Company C declined to make a proposal in 2016 after weeks of
evaluation. Based on these analyses and Rice's prior experience, the representatives of Barclays advised that, in their judgment, it was
unlikely that any counterparty could make a proposal that would be superior to EQT's proposal in light of the uniquely attractive synergies
and industrial logic inherent in a combination with EQT, which made the EQT shares a highly attractive acquisition currency. Extensive
discussion by the Rice board then ensued, with the Rice board considering (i) their interaction with the potential counterparties less than a
year prior, (ii) the judgment of Barclays and the board members themselves that contacting other counterparties was unlikely to yield a
proposal more attractive than EQT's proposal, particularly if Rice was able to negotiate additional value, (iii) the fact that Rice was not for
sale and that the EQT transaction represented a strategic opportunity and (iv) the need to maintain confidentiality. Based on these
considerations, the Rice board determined to proceed with negotiations with EQT and not contact the other potential counterparties
identified. Following this discussion, the Rice board authorized management to make a counterproposal to EQT for a business
combination in which Rice stockholders would receive the equivalent of between 0.51 and 0.52 of a share of EQT common stock for each
share of Rice common stock, which implied a value of between $28.77 and $29.34 per share of Rice common stock at EQT's then-trading
stock price of $56.42, reflecting a premium of approximately 34% - 36% to Rice's then-trading stock price of $21.52 and an enterprise
value multiple of approximately 7.7x - 7.8x Rice's estimated 2018E EBITDAX as adjusted by EQT management.

        On May 22, 2017, Mr. Rice and Toby Z. Rice, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Rice met with Messrs. Schlotterbeck and
McNally and proposed a combination in which Rice stockholders would receive 0.43 of a share of EQT common stock and $5.00 in cash
for each share of Rice common stock (roughly equivalent to 0.52 of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock
and an implied value of $29.30 per share of Rice common stock, reflecting a premium of approximately 37% to Rice's then-trading stock
price of $21.42 and an enterprise value multiple of

approximately 7.8x Rice's estimated 2018E EBITDAX as adjusted by EQT management). Messrs. Schlotterbeck and McNally stated that
they believed the proposed price was too high and the parties' value expectations appeared to be far enough apart that it did not make sense
for transaction negotiations to continue on that basis or for the parties to proceed with management presentations which previously had
been scheduled for the following day. Later that evening, Mr. Rice telephoned Mr. McNally to suggest that the parties continue to
negotiate, encouraging EQT to submit a counterproposal as the basis for such continued negotiations.

        On May 23, 2017, Mr. McNally contacted Mr. Rice and proposed a combination in which Rice stockholders would receive 0.36 of a
share of EQT common stock and $5.00 in cash for each share of Rice common stock (roughly equivalent to 0.45 of a share of EQT
common stock for each share of Rice common stock and an implied value of $25.34 per share of Rice common stock, reflecting a
premium of approximately 18% to Rice's then-trading stock price of $21.42 and an enterprise value multiple of approximately 7.0x Rice's
2018E EBITDAX as adjusted by EQT management). That evening, the Rice board held a telephonic meeting at which members of Rice
management and representatives of Barclays were present. Mr. Rice updated the Rice board on EQT's counterproposal. Representatives of
Barclays provided the Rice board with preliminary financial perspectives regarding EQT's counterproposal and various alternatives of
stock and cash above EQT's counterproposal. Following discussion, the Rice board authorized Mr. Rice to make a counteroffer to EQT
based on an implied exchange ratio of no less than 0.48 of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock.

        Later that evening, Mr. Rice contacted Mr. McNally and proposed a combination in which Rice stockholders would receive 0.40 of a
share of EQT common stock and $5.00 in cash for each share of Rice common stock (roughly equivalent to 0.49 of a share of EQT
common stock for each share of Rice common stock and an implied value of $27.88 per share of Rice common stock, reflecting a
premium of approximately 32% to Rice's then-trading stock price of $21.20 and an enterprise value multiple of approximately 7.5x Rice's
estimated 2018E EBITDAX as adjusted by EQT management).

        On May 24 and 25, 2017, Mr. Rice and Mr. McNally held a series of discussions concerning the appropriate exchange ratio.
Ultimately, each agreed to take a proposal to their respective boards for a combination in which Rice stockholders would receive 0.37 of a
share of EQT common stock and $5.30 in cash for each share of Rice common stock (roughly equivalent to 0.465 of a share of EQT
common stock for each share of Rice common stock and an implied value of $26.47 per share of Rice common stock based on EQT's
May 23, 2017 closing stock price, reflecting a premium of approximately 25% to Rice's closing stock price on such date and an enterprise
value multiple of approximately 7.2x Rice's estimated 2018E EBITDAX as adjusted by EQT management). Mr. McNally advised Mr. Rice
that this amount was EQT's firm and final offer.

        On May 26, 2017, the Rice board held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Vinson & Elkins, Rice's outside legal counsel, and
Barclays were also present at the meeting. The Rice board discussed the recent conversation between Messrs. Rice and McNally. Mr. Rice
noted that he believed that the proposal was as far as EQT would go on value and recommended to the Rice board that they accept this
latest proposal. Representatives of Barclays provided the Rice board with updated preliminary financial perspectives regarding the revised
proposal and, following a request for confirmation by a member of the Rice board, again advised that, in their judgment, it was unlikely
that any realistic counterparty could make an offer that would be superior to EQT's proposal. Representatives of Vinson & Elkins reviewed
with the Rice board a summary of the merger agreement that had been prepared to be sent to EQT. Following discussion by its members,
the Rice board authorized management to accept the exchange ratio of 0.37 of a share of EQT common stock and $5.30 in cash for each
share of Rice common stock, subject to negotiation of a definitive merger agreement and completion of due diligence.

        That afternoon, Vinson & Elkins delivered a draft of the merger agreement to Wachtell Lipton. Also on that afternoon, Rice
confidentially submitted to the SEC a first amendment to the draft registration statement on Form S-1 for RMGP.

        On May 30, 2017, Wachtell Lipton delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement as well as an initial draft of the voting
agreement to be executed by members of the Rice family and their affiliates, to Vinson & Elkins.

        On May 31, 2017, the EQT board met, together with members of management and Wachtell Lipton and Citi, to discuss and review
management's progress to date with respect to the potential transaction with Rice. At this meeting, management updated the EQT board
regarding recent discussions with representatives of Rice, including with respect to the parties' preliminary, non-binding understanding
regarding purchase price. Also at this meeting, EQT management and Citi reviewed with the EQT board certain preliminary financial and
strategic considerations relating to the potential transaction, and representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the EQT board legal
matters including terms of the draft merger agreement. The EQT board authorized the representatives of management, with the assistance
of Wachtell Lipton and Citi, to proceed with the transaction negotiations and continue to apprise the EQT board of material developments.

        Later on May 31, 2017, representatives of Vinson & Elkins and Wachtell Lipton held a teleconference to discuss a number of open
points reflected in the agreement drafts traded between the parties, including (i) the number of existing Rice directors that would be
appointed to the EQT board at closing, (ii) the treatment of Rice equity awards, (iii) the scope of the interim operating covenants,
(iv) whether the Rice board would be permitted to terminate the merger agreement for a superior proposal, (v) the size of the termination
fees and whether the terminations fees would be reciprocal or proportional based on the parties' respective equity values, (vi) matters
related to employee retention amounts and post-closing treatment of employees, (vii) non-competition obligations of Daniel J. Rice III, a
member of the Rice board, and certain Rice executives, and (viii) covenants related to antitrust and financing cooperation.

        On June 1 and 2, 2017, Vinson & Elkins and Wachtell Lipton exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and held a series of calls to
discuss open points in the draft relating to deal protection.

        On the afternoon of June 2, 2017, Mr. Vagt and James E. Rohr, lead independent director of the EQT board, met for lunch to discuss
the transaction generally and, in particular, the number and identity of Rice board members that would be appointed to the combined
company board.

        That afternoon, Wachtell Lipton contacted Vinson & Elkins and proposed as a compromise that EQT would accept a larger
termination fee payable by EQT in the event that the EQT board changed its recommendation for reasons other than a superior proposal
and certain changes to the non-solicitation covenant requested by Rice, in return for a termination fee of 4% of Rice's equity value in all
other circumstances, changes to the termination provisions requested by EQT and a "force the vote" provision that would allow the Rice
board to change its recommendation for a superior proposal, but not permit the Rice board to terminate the merger agreement to accept a
superior proposal. Separately, Mr. McNally advised Mr. Rice by e-mail that EQT wanted to agree on these deal protection provisions prior
to engaging on other aspects, such as board seats and employee related matters.

        That evening, Mr. Rice telephoned Mr. McNally and advised Mr. McNally that Rice was willing to accept most of EQT's proposed
terms on deal protection, but required a right to terminate for a superior proposal, a minimum of three board seats, acceptable provisions
on equity award vesting and retention support to ensure that key employees would remain with Rice through closing and additional
flexibility on the interim operating covenants between signing and closing.

        On the morning of June 3, 2017, Mr. McNally called Mr. Rice to discuss the open points in the merger agreement which they had
discussed the prior evening and requested that Rice provide a draft merger agreement that reflected Rice's position on these matters. That
afternoon, Vinson & Elkins sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Wachtell Lipton.

        On the morning of June 4, 2017, representatives of Vinson & Elkins and Wachtell Lipton had a series of calls related to employee
matters. That afternoon, Wachtell Lipton sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Vinson & Elkins, which continued to provide for
the appointment of a single

Rice board member to the EQT board, a "force the vote" provision and a reversion on most matters related to employee equity awards,
retention awards and post-closing compensation covenants.

        On June 5, 2017, representatives of Rice and its advisors held a teleconference with representatives of EQT and its advisors to discuss
open points in the merger agreement relating to deal protection, board representation, treatment of employee equity awards, retention
awards and post-closing compensation covenants.

        On the evening of June 6, 2017, Mr. Rice met in person with Mr. Schlotterbeck to discuss the remaining open deal points which had
been discussed by the parties the previous day. Mr. Schlotterbeck and Mr. Rice were unable to agree on mutually acceptable resolutions to
the open deal points, and the parties agreed to discontinue discussions at that time. Each of Messrs. Schlotterbeck and Rice subsequently
updated members of their respective boards on the status of the discussions, including their June 6, 2017 conversation.

        On June 9, 2017, Mr. McNally and Mr. Rice met in person and discussed whether there was a path to reengagement, but did not come
to agreement on pursuing further discussions.

        On June 13, 2017, representatives of Barclays and Citi, at the direction of and with guidance from Rice and EQT, respectively, met to
discuss whether there was any path to reengaging and resolving the open points between the parties.

        On June 15, 2017, following up on the previous day's discussion, at EQT's direction, Citi conveyed EQT's proposals to
representatives of Barclays that addressed certain open points between the parties. The proposals included, among other things, proposed
compromises related to (i) equity awards for Rice employees who would not continue with EQT, (ii) a retention program that would allow
Rice to provide 12 months of severance and 12 months of health insurance to its employees who remained with Rice through closing,
(iii) the Rice board's ability to terminate the merger agreement for a superior proposal but requiring the same termination fees for both
parties, (iv) each party's interim operating covenants, (v) post-closing compensation and benefits matters for employees continuing with
EQT, (vi) a three-year non-competition obligation of members of the Rice family and Robert Wingo, but conceding that other executives
would be subject only to the non-competition obligations in their respective employment agreements, and (vii) board composition of the
combined company, which would include two existing Rice board members (one of whom would be Mr. Rice).

        Following discussion between members of Rice management, Barclays and Vinson & Elkins, as well as input from Mr. Vagt,
Barclays advised Citi that progress had been made within the general parameters but that further work would be needed to reach
agreement and presented Rice's counterproposals on certain points that remained open, including that (i) any differences in compensation
for a Rice employee continuing with EQT be subject to a one-time true-up payment, (ii) Rice's covenant concerning assisting in the
financing (the "financing cooperation covenant") be generally subject to an efforts standard, and that the agreement provide that a breach
of the financing cooperation covenant would not result in a failure of a condition unless such breach was willful and material, and (iii) the
agreement that the Rice board members appointed to the EQT board be nominated by EQT at the 2018 EQT annual meeting be
enforceable by such Rice board members. Representatives of Citi then met with representatives of EQT management to discuss the
counterproposals from Rice. Following this discussion and at the direction of EQT management, representatives of Citi confirmed to
representatives of Barclays that Rice's counterproposals were an acceptable framework to continue negotiations.

        In the afternoon of June 15, 2017, a representative of Company C contacted a representative of Barclays to advise that Company C
understood that Rice was close to reaching an agreement with EQT and inquiring as to whether Rice would consider discussing a
combination transaction with Company C. The Barclays representative promptly advised Rice management and Rice management
promptly advised members of the Rice board of the discussions with a representative of Company C.

        Later in the afternoon of June 15, 2017, the Rice board held a regularly scheduled telephonic meeting at which members of Rice
management were present. Mr. Rice updated the Rice board on EQT's proposals received that morning and Rice's counterproposals. The
Rice board generally agreed that the compromise proposals were constructive but wanted to confirm that the compromise proposals had
the support of the EQT board, as well as EQT management. Following discussion, the Rice board authorized Mr. Rice to confirm with
EQT management that the compromise proposals were supported by the EQT board in addition to EQT management. At this meeting,
Mr. Rice also discussed with the Rice board the inquiry from Company C. Given that Company C had not provided any specifics (even
qualitatively), given that Company C had declined to make a proposal when invited to do so during the 2016 process after weeks of
evaluation, and given that Company C was one of the companies considered earlier in the process and was determined to be unlikely to
provide value to the Rice stockholders that was superior to the EQT proposal (because at even a modest premium, an acquisition of Rice
by Company C would be meaningfully dilutive to Company C's estimated 2018 cash flow per share), the Rice board determined to not
engage with Company C.

        On the morning of June 16, 2017, Vinson & Elkins delivered a draft of the merger agreement to Wachtell Lipton reflecting the terms
contained in the summary proposal.

        That day, Mr. Rice met with Mr. Rohr to discuss the transaction and Mr. Rice's role with the combined company. Later that afternoon,
and again in the morning and early afternoon of June 17, 2017, the parties and their counsel had a series of conversations to negotiate
remaining open points in the merger agreement including matters relating to the financing cooperation covenant, whether differences in
compensation for a Rice employee continuing with EQT would be subject to a one-time true-up payment, and the second board seat
requested by Rice and associated logistics (in particular, whether EQT's requirement to add a second Rice board nominee at closing would
be subject to approval by EQT shareholders of a charter amendment expanding the permitted size of the EQT board).

        In the evening of June 17, 2017, the Rice board held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Vinson & Elkins, Rice's outside legal
counsel, and Barclays were also present at the meeting. Representatives of Vinson & Elkins summarized for the Rice board the key terms
of the merger agreement, including a discussion of the points that remained open at that time. After discussion, the Rice board authorized
Vinson & Elkins and Barclays to call Wachtell Lipton and Citi after the meeting and resolve the open points in the manner discussed at the
meeting. Following this discussion, representatives of Barclays reviewed its preliminary financial analyses that it had performed on the
proposed merger consideration and advised that on this basis, and based on current conditions, it would be in position to render an opinion
to the Rice board that based upon and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, as of the date of the
opinion, from a financial point of view, the merger consideration to be offered to Rice stockholders in the transactions (other than holders
of shares of Rice common stock (a) that are subject to perfected appraisal rights, (b) held in treasury by Rice, (c) owned by EQT, Merger
Sub or EQT Investments Holdings, LLC, the intermediate subsidiary of EQT that holds all of Merger Sub's outstanding capital stock,
which will automatically be canceled and cease to exist or (d) held by any wholly owned subsidiary of EQT (other than Merger Sub or
EQT Investments Holdings, LLC) (collectively, the "excluded shares") is fair to such stockholders.

        Following the Rice board meeting, representatives of Barclays and Vinson & Elkins contacted representatives of Citi and Wachtell
Lipton to discuss the remaining open points in the merger agreement. These discussions continued on June 18, 2017, by which time the
parties had substantially resolved the open deal points relating to the second board seat and the financing cooperation covenant, but the
one-time true-up payment for Rice employees continuing with EQT remained open. Later that morning, Wachtell Lipton sent over revised
drafts of the merger agreement and related documentation. These drafts reflected the parties' agreement that (i) the appointment of Mr.
Vagt to the EQT board

would be conditioned on the approval of a charter amendment by the EQT shareholders, as agreed by the parties and (ii) the financing
cooperation covenant would not be subject to a reasonable best efforts standard, but a failure to deliver required financial information
could not serve as a termination right for EQT unless it remained uncured by the end date. The draft also reflected EQT's position, which
remained an open deal point, that differences in compensation for a Rice employee continuing with EQT would not be subject to a one-
time true-up payment.

        In the afternoon of June 18, 2017, the Rice board held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Vinson & Elkins and Barclays were
also present at the meeting. Representatives of Vinson & Elkins summarized for the Rice board its prior conversation with Wachtell Lipton
and EQT's position. After discussion, the Rice board agreed to the terms proposed by EQT, including the exclusion of the one-time true-up
payment. Representatives of Barclays advised that its financial analyses that had been discussed with the Rice board remained unchanged
and rendered its oral opinion to the Rice board, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated June 19, 2017, to the effect
that based upon and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, as of the date of the opinion, from a
financial point of view, the merger consideration to be offered to Rice stockholders in the transactions (other than holders of excluded
shares) is fair to such stockholders. After discussing potential reasons for and against the proposed merger, the Rice board unanimously
determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are in the best interests of Rice stockholders and are
advisable, approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and recommended that the Rice stockholders vote to
adopt the merger agreement at any meeting of the Rice stockholders to be called for the purposes of acting thereon.

        After the meeting of the Rice board, the parties finalized the transaction documents.

        On the morning of June 19, 2017, the EQT board met telephonically, together with members of management and Wachtell Lipton and
Citi, to discuss and review the draft merger agreement and to consider the proposed transaction. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton
reviewed the duties of the directors and the terms of the draft merger agreement. Also at this meeting, Citi reviewed with the EQT board
its financial analysis of the merger consideration and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated June 19,
2017, to the EQT board to the effect that, as of such date and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken, the merger consideration to be paid by EQT pursuant to
the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to EQT. Following extensive discussion, the EQT board unanimously
determined that the merger was fair to, and in the best interests of, EQT and its shareholders, unanimously approved and declared
advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and authorized EQT to enter
into the merger agreement.

        After the EQT board meeting, the parties executed the agreements in connection with the transaction and, prior to the opening of
trading on Rice's and EQT's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Rice and EQT issued a joint press release announcing the
execution of the merger agreement.

Recommendation of the EQT Board and Reasons for the Merger 

        At a meeting held on June 19, 2017, the EQT board unanimously determined the merger agreement and the other agreements and
transactions contemplated thereby, including the share issuance, are fair to and in the best interests of EQT and its shareholders and
approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the share issuance, and
approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement. The EQT board recommends that EQT's shareholders
vote "FOR" the share issuance proposal, "FOR" the charter amendment proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

        In evaluating the proposed transactions, the EQT board consulted with EQT's management and legal and financial advisors and, in
reaching its determination and recommendation, considered a number of factors including, without limitation, the impact the merger would
have on EQT's ability to address its sum-of-the-parts discount through, among other things, potential spin-off transactions. The EQT board
also consulted with outside legal counsel regarding its obligations, legal due diligence matters and the terms of the merger agreement and
other documents related to the transactions contemplated thereby.

        Many of the factors considered favored the conclusion of the EQT board that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, including the share issuance, are advisable and in the best interests of EQT and its shareholders, including the
following:

• Creation of a Compelling Investment Opportunity.  The EQT board believes that the merger will allow EQT to pursue a
corporate strategy unavailable to a significant majority of the industry. The combined company will be a best-in-class
North American natural gas company with premiere acreage positions in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. 

• EQT will be positioned to benefit from high quality, natural gas weighted assets totaling an estimated 75 trillion
cubic feet equivalents (Tcfe) in resource potential and over 727,000 combined net acres in the core of the Marcellus
and Utica Shales, positioning EQT for material production growth in the near and long term. 

• The addition of Rice's acreage position to the EQT portfolio will distinguish the combined company as having the
deepest, highest quality drilling inventory in the Appalachian Basin. Rice has been able to establish a large
inventory of 1,102 net Marcellus and Ohio Utica drilling locations that are de-risked by the producing wells it has
drilled, which have some of the highest single-well returns in the basin to date. In 2016, Rice reached 1.0 Bcf/d of
gross operated natural gas production with fewer wells drilled than any of the 12 other U.S. producers to reach this
production threshold, having done so with only 180 wells drilled. As a result of the merger and the operational
synergies described in more detail below, EQT's inventory in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, two
of the highest productivity counties in the Appalachian Basin, will improve in both scale and profitability—
increasing from approximately 775 undeveloped locations with an average of 8,000' lateral to approximately 1,200
undeveloped drilling locations with an average of 12,000' lateral. EQT expects to focus its development efforts
substantially in these locations in the near term to differentiate the combined company from its Appalachian peers,
with returns per well anticipated to increase from 52% to 70% at a $3.00/Mcf NYMEX natural gas price. 

• The combined company will represent one of the lowest cost, highest margin operators in the United States, with an
anticipated investment grade credit rating, allowing for continued industry-leading value creation even in a lower-
for-longer commodity price environment. 

• As a result, through the consummation of the merger, EQT expects to position itself as one of the few, if not the
only, large-cap, investment grade independent exploration and production companies capable of significant near
and long-term production growth from its existing asset base. EQT anticipates this production growth will be
achieved with significantly improved profitability given the capital, operational and administrative efficiencies
expected in connection with the merger, including the ability for the combined company to achieve the same pro-
forma feet-of-pay developed with 20% fewer Pennsylvania wells in 2018 and 35% fewer Pennsylvania wells in
2019 than would have been the case for EQT on a standalone basis. Given the flexibility created by becoming the
lowest-cost natural gas operator, EQT expects to have the ability to return value to shareholders across commodity
cycles, and is targeting cash flow breakeven for the combined company in 2019 with a plan to provide meaningful
cash returns to shareholders in 2020 and beyond.

• Pivotal Strategic Opportunity.  The EQT board believes that the merger represents a unique and presently available
opportunity to create value and materially advance EQT's consolidation strategy, and the failure to pursue an actionable
transaction with Rice would be a significant and irreversible lost value creation opportunity for EQT. 

• Following the Alpha Acquisition and the Vantage Acquisition, the EQT board believed that the number of
remaining consolidation opportunities in EQT's core areas had narrowed considerably, with Rice having materially
expanded its footprint in EQT's core operating area, thereby becoming a uniquely attractive and complementary
potential business combination for EQT. 

• The EQT board reached the conclusion that, in light of the scarcity of remaining potential consolidation
opportunities and EQT's desire to expand its drilling inventory of high-returning Marcellus Shale wells, a
combination of Rice with a third party would materially limit the remaining scope of strategic consolidation
opportunities available for EQT to pursue in its core areas, which in turn could cause EQT's cost structure to
become less competitive relative to other industry participants with more consolidated positions. 

• Furthermore, pursuing the merger will enhance, and will not delay, EQT's ability to unlock the value attributable to
solving the sum-of-the-parts discount at EQT, as the merger will increase the scale and improve the competitive
positioning of each of EQT's key businesses. As such, the EQT board believes that Rice represented a pivotal
strategic opportunity, one that substantially finalizes EQT's consolidation strategy and enhances its ability to pursue
a path to further unlocking its embedded midstream value. 

• Participation in the Unlocking of Embedded Value in Rice.  The EQT Board believes that its shareholders will benefit, even
after application of the purchase premium, in the unlocking of significant embedded value at Rice. The embedded value
that EQT believes will be illuminated, or the illumination of which will be accelerated, as a result of the merger include the
following: 

• Over $3 Billion of Embedded Midstream Value.  Rice has previously publicly ascribed over $3 billion of value to its
retained midstream assets, including Rice Olympus Midstream and Strike Force Midstream (the "Drop Down
Candidates"), and a 91.75% interest in RMGP, which owns the incentive distribution rights and a 28% limited
partner interest in RMP. EQT expects to monetize the Drop Down Candidates in 2018 through a sale to EQM,
thereby accelerating their value creation for EQT, including by materially enhancing the cash flow growth profile
attributable to the incentive distribution rights owned by EQGP. 

• Elimination of Going Concern Discounts on Highly Valuable Acreage.  Rice is non-investment grade with a
relatively short operating history and a complex corporate structure, and its performance is substantially dependent
on the price of natural gas. As a result, Rice has historically traded at multiples below that of EQT and other
Appalachian peers. While Rice has taken and continues to take steps to eliminate the discount at which it has
traded, the merger with EQT should allow for Rice's assets to be valued appropriately as part of the combined
company's best-in-class acreage portfolio in the Appalachian Basin. The EQT board also noted that, in light of
Rice's relative valuation discounts, the merger is anticipated to be accretive on a net asset value basis even without
assuming any synergies which are expected to be significant. 

• Significant Synergies.  In addition to the strategic rationale and the ability to participate in unlocking value embedded
within Rice, EQT expects that its shareholders will derive a substantial benefit from the significant synergies attributable to
the transaction. The EQT board believes that the merger will create capital efficiencies and operational cost savings and
synergies

through conducting EQT's and Rice's operations as part of a combined enterprise, including synergies resulting from:

• the opportunity to optimize the combined company's upstream and midstream standalone portfolios by applying
each company's best practices across the contiguous and complimentary acreage positions; 

• the opportunity for a significant increase in the average lateral lengths of future Marcellus wells, reducing well
costs on a per horizontal foot basis and increasing the present value of development; 

• the expectation of meaningfully reduced lease operating expense per unit through more efficient development,
including an increase in wells per pad, an increase in company net horizontal feet through coordinated development
plan eliminating drainage effects, a reduction in rig and frac fleet move times, coordinated produced water handling
and improved cycle times through concentrated execution; 

• overhead savings through elimination of duplicative corporate and public company costs; 

• midstream cost savings resulting from efficient infrastructure buildouts, as well as the ability to expand Rice's
freshwater transportation expertise across EQT's legacy acreage; 

• gathering system connectivity that will enhance supply aggregation to the Equitrans, Mountain Valley and Ohio
Valley Connector pipelines; 

• more efficient development of gathering systems leading to higher returns for EQM and lower cost to EQT; 

• an improved midstream growth profile through the addition of significant EQM drop-down inventory; 

• leveraging of the respective best practices, data and technological capabilities of each of Rice and EQT, including
potential for improved well design to achieve greater returns on the combined acreage position; 

• an increase in the amount and percentage of organic leasing opportunities that can be valued as leases that expand
the potential lateral length of planned development; and 

• an enhanced ability to right-size and optimize the combined company's firm transportation portfolio, including
through increased access to premium Gulf, Southeast and Midwest markets.

        As a result of the synergies detailed above, EQT expects that the transaction will be significantly accretive to EQT shareholders in the
first year following closing.

        The EQT board also considered the following factors in support of its conclusion that the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the share issuance, are advisable and in the best interests of EQT and its shareholders:

• information from and discussions with EQT's management and advisors regarding EQT's and Rice's respective current
business strategies and prospects, including the projected long-term financial results of EQT and Rice as stand-alone
companies and the expected pro forma effect of the proposed transactions on EQT; 

• the EQT board's understanding of EQT's and Rice's businesses as well as their respective financial performance, results of
operations and future prospects, which supported the EQT board's view that the merger consideration reflected a reasonable
price for Rice; 

• the opinion of Citi, dated June 19, 2017, to the EQT board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the
date of the opinion, of the merger consideration to be paid by EQT

pursuant to the merger agreement, which opinion was based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken as more fully described below
under the caption "—Opinion of EQT's Financial Advisor";

• the review by the EQT board with its advisors of the structure of the proposed transactions and the financial and other
terms of the merger agreement, including the parties' representations, warranties and covenants, the conditions to their
respective obligations and the termination provisions, as well as the likelihood of consummation of the proposed
transactions and the EQT board's evaluation of the likely time period necessary to complete the transactions. The EQT
board also considered the following specific aspects of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement: 

• the nature of the closing conditions included in the merger agreement, including the reciprocal exceptions to the
events that would constitute a material adverse effect on either EQT or Rice for purposes of the merger agreement,
as well as the likelihood of satisfaction of all conditions to completion of the transactions; 

• the efforts required by each party to obtain approvals from or clearances by the applicable governmental authorities;

• the fact that the named Rice stockholders who, as of the date of the merger agreement collectively held
approximately 15% of the outstanding voting power of Rice's voting stock, agreed to vote in favor of the merger
agreement proposal, subject to certain exceptions; and 

• the circumstances under which certain termination fees and reimbursements of expenses could become payable by
the parties to the merger agreement, as described in more detail elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        In the course of its deliberations, the EQT board also considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors, including the
following:

• the possibility that the transactions may not be completed or that completion may be unduly delayed for reasons beyond the
control of EQT and/or Rice, including the potential length of the regulatory review process and the risk that the applicable
governmental authorities may prohibit or enjoin the transactions or otherwise impose conditions on EQT and/or Rice in
order to obtain clearance for the transactions; 

• the possibility that, in certain circumstances relating to the failure to obtain shareholder approval of the share issuance
proposal, EQT could be required to reimburse Rice's expenses up to $67 million; 

• the potential for diversion of management and employee attention and the potential effect of the transactions on EQT's
business and strategic relationships; 

• the potential that the fixed exchange ratio for the stock consideration could result in EQT delivering greater value to Rice
stockholders than had been anticipated should the value of the shares of EQT common stock increase from the date of
execution of the merger agreement; 

• the risk that the benefits to EQT, following completion of the transactions, will not be realized or will take longer to realize
than expected; 

• the possibility that changes in global economic conditions and fluctuations in exchange and interest rates could make
EQT's financing difficult to obtain on favorable terms or at all; 

• the transaction costs to be incurred in connection with the proposed transactions; and 

• risks of the type and nature described under the sections titled "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Statements Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements."

        The EQT board considered all of these factors as a whole and, on balance, concluded that they supported a determination to approve
the merger agreement. The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the EQT board is not exhaustive. In view of
the myriad factors considered by the EQT board in connection with its evaluation of the proposed transactions and the complexity of these
matters, the EQT board did not consider it practical to, nor did it attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors that it considered in reaching its decision. The EQT board evaluated the factors described above, among others, and
reached a unanimous consensus that the merger agreement and the other agreements and transactions contemplated thereby, including,
without limitation, the merger and the share issuance, were fair to and in the best interests of EQT and its shareholders and approved and
declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the share issuance and the charter
amendment, and approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement. In considering the factors described above
and any other factors, individual members of the EQT board may have viewed factors differently or given different weight or merit to
different factors.

Recommendation of the Rice Board and Reasons for the Merger 

        By unanimous vote, the Rice board, at a meeting held on June 18, 2017, determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
Rice stockholders to enter into the merger agreement, and unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, including the merger, and resolved to recommend the adoption of the merger agreement by Rice stockholders
and that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of Rice stockholders. The Rice board recommends
that Rice stockholders vote "FOR" the merger agreement proposal, "FOR" the compensation proposal and "FOR" the Rice
adjournment proposal.

        In evaluating the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the transaction documents (including the
merger agreement), the Rice board consulted with Rice's senior management, outside legal counsel and financial advisors. In
recommending that Rice stockholders vote their shares of Rice common stock in favor of adoption of the merger agreement, the Rice
board also considered a number of factors, including the following factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance) which the Rice
board viewed as being generally positive or favorable in coming to its determination, approval and related recommendation:

• Attractive Value and Attractive Acquisition Currency.  The Rice board believed the merger consideration was an attractive
value for shares of Rice common stock, especially in light of the Rice board's view that the EQT stock constituting a
majority of the transaction consideration represents an attractive investment opportunity with significant upside. Based on
the closing price of shares of EQT common stock on the NYSE of $58.77 on June 16, 2017, the last trading day before the
public announcement of the merger agreement, the merger consideration represented an implied value of $27.04 for each
share of Rice common stock, which represented a premium of (i) approximately 37.4% to the $19.69 per share closing
price of Rice common stock on June 16, 2017, the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger
agreement; and (ii) approximately 30.2% to the $20.78 per share volume-weighted average trading price of Rice common
stock for the 30 trading days ended June 16, 2017, the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger
agreement. The Rice board also believed that the merger will be accretive to Rice stockholders on a cash flow per share
basis in 2018 and on a net asset value basis. The Rice board also believes that the EQT shares that will be delivered to Rice
stockholders as merger consideration are a highly attractive currency that will benefit in the near and long term from the
combination's significant synergies described in more detail below. 

• Best Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value.  The Rice board determined that entering into the merger agreement
with EQT was more favorable to Rice stockholders than other

alternatives reasonably available to Rice, including continued operation of Rice on a standalone basis and the pursuit of
potential actionable strategic or financial transactions, in light of a number of factors, including the Rice board's assessment
of Rice's business, assets and prospects, its competitive position, and its historical and financial performance, which are
described in more detail below. Of particular import, the Rice board focused on the need to economically replace and
expand drilling inventory over time, and the impacts of both the competitive landscape and relative maturity of the
Appalachian Basin on Rice's ability to continue to expand inventory in highly accretive manners. In determining that the
merger is the best alternative for maximizing stockholder value, the Rice board also considered the uniquely attractive
synergy potential of a combination with EQT, from which Rice stockholders will be positioned to benefit based on their
anticipated 35% ownership of the combined company at closing.

Continuation of Standalone Rice Energy

        The Rice board considered alternative paths to create stockholder value as a standalone company, including long-term inventory
expansion through in-basin consolidation and out-of-basin acquisitions. The Rice board assessed the benefits and risks attributable to each
these alternatives, including:

• The limited opportunities for inventory expansion that compete with the economics of Rice's existing inventory, which
reduces the likelihood of it being the ultimate acquirer thereof as compared to competitors that can accelerate value; 

• The likelihood of an adverse share price reaction to pursuing either path given the high transaction price expectations in the
basin, as was seen in Rice's acquisition of Vantage Energy, and recent share price reactions to out-of-basin acquisitions by
certain of Rice's competitors; and 

• The risks attendant to executing on either strategy given Rice's historical focus on acquisitions of largely undeveloped
acreage, including integration and multi-basin operational risk.

        The Rice board also considered alternative paths to unlocking stockholder value, including executing upon a planned drop-down of
Rice Olympus Midstream LLC to RMP and the initial public offering of Rice Midstream GP Holdings LLC or, alternatively, the sale of its
incentive distribution rights to RMP.

• The Rice board assessed the reliance on each such transaction on the capital markets, the current state and long-term
expectations thereof. 

• The Rice board considered the potential for such transactions to provide Rice with access to a lower cost of capital for
executing on either of its inventory expansion strategies, and the impact of such transactions on the Rice share price. The
Rice board determined that the cost-of-capital and share price impacts would be impacted over the long-term by the ability
to expand inventory.

Benefits of a Combination with EQT

        The Rice board determined that the merger with EQT provided the best alternative for maximizing stockholder value. In coming to
this determination, the Rice board analyzed a number of factors, including the following:

• The combined operational positions would allow for significant operational synergies given the contiguous nature of the
companies' acreage positions in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, which Rice believes are the two most
economic counties in the Southwestern Pennsylvania dry gas core of the Marcellus Shale. These operational synergies
would be

Table of Contents

geographically unique to a combination with EQT versus any of the other operators in the region and are expected to
include:

• The substantial contiguity in the acreage footprints should allow for a significant increase in the average lateral
lengths of future Marcellus wells of the combined company, thereby significantly reducing well costs on a per
horizontal foot basis and increasing the present value of development; 

• In addition, the proximity of operations will allow for more efficient development—including an increase in wells
per pad, an increase in company net horizontal feet through coordinated development plan eliminating drainage
effects, a reduction in rig and frac fleet move times, coordinated produced water handling and improved cycle times
through concentrated execution—which is expected to meaningfully reduce lease operating expenses; 

• The operational footprint proximity will allow for midstream cost savings resulting from efficient infrastructure
buildouts, benefiting both the combined companies and their midstream affiliates, as well as the ability to expand
Rice's freshwater transportation expertise across EQT's legacy acreage; 

• The combination allows for the combined company to leverage within its existing operating areas best practices and
technological advances of each of Rice and EQT, including potential for improved well design to achieve greater
returns on the combined acreage position; 

• The combination increases the amount and percentage of organic leasing opportunities that can be valued as leases
that expand the potential lateral length of planned development; and 

• The combined company will have the ability to right-size and optimize firm transportation portfolio. 

• The combined company would represent an unique investment opportunity both within the Appalachian Basin and in the
industry at large. 

• The combined company would be a premier North American natural gas company with best-in-class acreage
positions in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. 

• The merger would result in the combined company being positioned as a tier I E&P company with a pro forma
enterprise value of approximately $26 billion based on the merger agreement, an anticipated investment grade
rating and a near-term production compounded annual growth rate of greater than 20%; 

• The combined company would have high quality, natural gas weighted assets totaling an estimated 75 trillion cubic
feet equivalents (Tcfe) in resource potential and over 727,000 combined net acres in the core of the Marcellus and
Utica Shales; 

• The combined company would be one of the lowest cost, highest margin operators in the country, allowing for
continued industry-leading value creation even in a lower-for-longer environment; 

• The merger would accelerate the unlocking of embedded value within Rice for the benefit of the combined shareholder
base. 

• The combination accelerates the reduction of full cycle costs by, among other things, reducing Rice general and
administrative expenses and interest expense; 

• The combination enhances the value attributable to solving the sum of the parts discounts that currently exist at
each of Rice and EQT and strengthens the combined company's ability to develop a value-creating path towards
addressing this discount;

• The combination accelerates the value attributable to Rice's Utica Shale acreage in Pennsylvania by applying the
technological advancements achieved by EQT to date; 

• The combined company would be managed by a team that has demonstrated the ability to execute in a manner necessary
for the long-term development of the combined assets, with a strong and extensive operating history and an ability to
maximize the value of its assets through long-term development; 

• Rice stockholders would have continuing influence in the execution of the strategy and business plan of the combined
company through the appointment of Messrs. Rice and Vagt as EQT board members in connection with the consummation
of the merger;

Alternative Combination Transactions

• The Rice board considered alternative transactions and, following review of such alternatives and consultation with
management and Barclays, believed that it was unlikely that an alternative bidder could consummate a transaction that
would be on superior terms, and that would provide Rice stockholders greater consideration, than is being provided in
connection with the merger. 

• In the summer of 2016, Rice management and Barclays conducted a targeted process of six of the most likely publicly
traded exploration and production companies to gauge their interest in a business combination with Rice. EQT and two
other companies entered into confidentiality agreements with Rice and only one (other than EQT) made a written proposal.
The trading price of that company's stock had since declined to the degree that, as of such time, the company's market
capitalization was smaller than that of Rice. Thus any premium transaction to Rice stockholders with this counterparty
involving equity consideration would have to be done at a discount to the counterparty's stock price, which the Rice board
determined was not reasonable. 

• Barclays provided the Rice board with financial analyses of strategic combination with five other potential counterparties
following which the Rice board determined that none of the other alternatives were likely to provide a superior proposal to
the merger. 

• Opportunity to Receive Alternative Acquisition Proposals and to Terminate the Merger in Order to Accept a Superior
Proposal.  The Rice board considered the terms of the merger agreement related to Rice's ability to respond to unsolicited
acquisition proposals and determined that third parties would be unlikely to be deterred from making a competing proposal
by the provisions of the merger agreement, including because the Rice board may, under certain circumstances, furnish
information or enter into discussions in connection with a competing proposal. In this regard, the Rice board considered
that: 

• subject to its compliance with the merger agreement, the Rice board can change its recommendation to Rice
stockholders with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by
the vote of its stockholders if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) that,
with respect to a superior proposal or an intervening event, the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the Rice board's fiduciary duties; 

• subject to its compliance with the merger agreement, the Rice board may terminate the merger agreement for a
superior proposal if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the Rice board's fiduciary duties; and 

• while the merger agreement contains a termination fee of $255 million that Rice would be required to pay to EQT
in certain circumstances, including if (i) EQT terminates the merger agreement in connection with an adverse

recommendation to stockholders with respect to adoption of the merger agreement or if Rice violates its non-
solicitation obligations under the merger agreement or (ii) if Rice terminates the merger agreement for a superior
proposal or enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal, the Rice board believed that this
fee is reasonable in light of the circumstances and the overall terms of the merger agreement, consistent with fees in
comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.

• Certainty of Value.  The Rice board considered that a portion of merger consideration is cash, which provides more
optionality and value certain for Rice stockholders by ensuring immediate value, as well as that the merger will provide
Rice stockholders with significantly greater trading liquidity. The Rice board also considered that the benefits of the merger
would be amplified in the event that natural gas prices rise above the current strip prices. 

• Post-Merger Corporate Governance.  The Rice board considered that the merger agreement provides that the EQT board
must take all necessary corporate action to appoint the Chief Executive Officer of Rice and the Chairman of the Rice board
to serve on the combined company's board of directors, subject, with respect to one of the designees to be selected (if
necessary) by the Rice board, to the EQT shareholders approving a charter amendment increasing the size of the EQT
board. 

• Tax Considerations.  The Rice board considered that the merger and the post-closing merger, taken together, are intended to
qualify for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

• Receipt of Fairness Opinion and Presentation from Barclays.  The Rice board considered the financial analysis reviewed
and discussed with representatives of Barclays, as well as the oral opinion of Barclays rendered to the Rice board on
June 18, 2017, which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated June 19, 2017, to the
effect that, based upon and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, as of the date of the
opinion, from a financial point of view, the merger consideration to be offered to the holders of Rice common stock in the
merger (other than holders of excluded shares), is fair to such stockholders, as more fully described below under the
caption "—Opinion of Rice's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 106. 

• EQT Dividend.  The Rice board considered that EQT pays a $0.12 per share annual dividend, which the Rice board expects
EQT to continue paying following completion of the merger. 

• Terms of the Merger Agreement.  The Rice board reviewed and considered that the terms of the merger agreement, taken as
a whole, including the parties' representations, warranties and covenants, and the circumstances under which the merger
agreement may be terminated, in its belief, are reasonable. The Rice board also reviewed and considered the conditions to
the closing of the merger, and concluded that while the closing of the merger is subject to various regulatory approvals,
such approvals were not likely to prevent the closing of the merger.

        The Rice board also considered a number of uncertainties, risks and factors it deemed generally negative or unfavorable in making its
determination, approval and related recommendation, including the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):

• Transaction Accretion.  The Rice board considered its belief that the merger will not be accretive to cash flow from
operations on a per share basis to Rice stockholders in 2019 or 2020. 

• Post-Merger Corporate Governance.  The Rice Board considered that although the merger agreement provides that the
EQT board must take all necessary corporate action to appoint the Chief Executive Officer of Rice and the chairman of the
Rice board to serve on the combined company's board of directors, it is possible that only one of either the Chief Executive
Officer of Rice and the chairman of the Rice board will serve on the EQT board if the EQT shareholders do not approve the
charter amendment proposal.

Table of Contents

• Rice Employees.  The Rice board considered the expectation that many Rice employees will not be retained by EQT
following completion of the merger. 

• Voting Agreement.  The Rice board considered that, because the merger agreement can be approved by holders of a
majority of the outstanding Rice common stock, and Rice Energy 2016 Irrevocable Trust, Rice Energy Holdings LLC,
Daniel J. Rice III, Daniel J. Rice IV, Derek A. Rice and Toby Z. Rice indirectly or indirectly own approximately 15% of the
outstanding Rice common stock and have entered into the voting and support agreement with EQT to vote in favor of the
merger, the merger could be approved even if less than a majority of the outstanding Rice common stock held by other Rice
stockholders is voted in favor of the merger. 

• Merger Consideration.  The Rice board considered that, because the equity component of the merger consideration is based
on a fixed exchange ratio rather than a fixed value, Rice stockholders bear the risk of a decrease in the trading price of EQT
common stock during the pendency of the merger and the fact that the merger agreement does not provide Rice with a
value-based termination right. 

• Interim Operating Covenants.  The Rice board considered the restrictions on the conduct of Rice's and its subsidiaries'
businesses during the period between the execution of the merger agreement and the completion of the merger as set forth
in the merger agreement. 

• Risks Associated with the Pendency of the Merger.  The risks and contingencies relating to the announcement and pendency
of the merger (including the likelihood of litigation or other opposition brought by or on behalf of Rice stockholders or
EQT shareholders challenging the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) and the risks
and costs to Rice if the closing of the merger is not accomplished in a timely manner or if the merger does not close at all,
including potential employee attrition, the impact on Rice's relationships with third parties and the effect termination of the
merger agreement may have on the trading price of Rice common stock and Rice's operating results. 

• EQT Change of Recommendation; EQT Shareholder Vote.  The Rice board considered the right of the EQT board to
change its recommendation to EQT shareholders in certain circumstances, subject to certain conditions. The Rice board
also considered that, even if the merger agreement is approved by Rice stockholders, EQT's shareholders may not approve
the share issuance, which is a condition of the merger. 

• Alternative Proposals; Termination Fees; Expense Reimbursement.  The Rice board considered the terms of the merger
agreement relating to no shop covenants and termination fees, and the potential that such provisions might deter alternative
bidders that might have been willing to submit a superior proposal to Rice. The Rice board also considered that, under
specified circumstances, Rice may be required to pay a termination fee or expenses in the event the merger agreement is
terminated and the effect this could have on Rice, including: 

• the possibility that the termination fee could discourage other potential parties from making a competing offer;
although the Rice board believed that the termination fee was reasonable in amount and would not unduly deter any
other party that might be interested in making a competing proposal; 

• if the merger is not consummated, Rice will pay its own expenses incident to preparing for and entering into and
carrying out its obligations under the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; and 

• the requirement that if the merger agreement is terminated as a result of the failure to obtain approval of Rice
stockholders, Rice would be obligated to reimburse EQT for up to $67 million of its expenses in connection with
the merger agreement.

• Regulatory Approval.  The Rice board considered that the merger and the related transactions require regulatory approval to
complete such transactions and the risk that the applicable governmental entities may seek to impose unfavorable terms or
conditions, or otherwise fail to grant, such approval. 

• Midstream Integration.  The expectation that the existence of two publicly traded midstream MLPs would necessitate post-
closing structuring attention. 

• Interests of Rice Directors and Executive Officers.  The Rice board that Rice's directors and executive officers may have
interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Rice's stockholders. For more information
about such interests, see below under the heading "—Interests of Certain Rice Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger." 

• Other Risks.  The Rice board considered risks of the type and nature described under the sections titled "Risk Factors",
beginning on page 34, and "Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements", beginning on page 32.

        The Rice board believed that, overall, the potential benefits of the merger to Rice stockholders outweighed the risks and uncertainties
of the merger.

        The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Rice board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors
considered by the Rice board. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, the Rice board
did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its
determinations and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Rice board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the
process and may have given different weight to different factors. The Rice board did not undertake to make any specific determination as
to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Rice board based
its recommendation on the totality of the information presented.

Certain EQT Unaudited Prospective Financial and Operating Information 

        EQT does not as a matter of course make public long-term forecasts or internal projections as to future performance, revenues,
production, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However,
in connection with its evaluation of the merger, EQT's management prepared certain unaudited internal financial forecasts with respect to
EQT, which were provided to the EQT board and Rice, as well as Rice's financial advisor, in connection with their evaluation of the
proposed merger. Such forecasts also were provided to Citi for its use and reliance in connection with its financial analyses and opinion
described in the section entitled "—Opinion of EQT's Financial Advisor." The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an
indication that any of EQT, Rice, their respective advisors or other representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or
now considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future performance or events, or that it should be construed as financial guidance,
and such summary projections set forth below should not be relied on as such.

        This information was prepared solely for internal use and is subjective in many respects. While presented with numeric specificity,
the unaudited prospective financial and operating information reflects numerous estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain
and may be beyond the control of EQT's management, including, among others, EQT's and Rice's future results, oil and gas industry
activity, commodity prices, demand for natural gas and crude oil, the availability of financing to fund the exploration and development
costs associated with the respective projected drilling programs, general economic and regulatory conditions and other matters described
in the sections entitled "Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors." The unaudited prospective
financial and operating information reflects both assumptions as to certain

business decisions that are subject to change and, in many respects, subjective judgment, and thus is susceptible to multiple interpretations
and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. EQT and Rice can give no assurance that the unaudited
prospective financial and operating information and the underlying estimates and assumptions will be realized. In addition, since the
unaudited prospective financial and operating information covers multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive
with each successive year. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth below, and important factors that may affect actual
results and cause the unaudited prospective financial information to be inaccurate include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties
relating to its business, industry performance, the regulatory environment, general business and economic conditions and other matters
described under the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled "Risk Factors." See also "Cautionary Statements Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements" and "Where You Can Find More Information."

        The unaudited prospective financial and operating information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor was it
prepared with a view toward compliance with GAAP, published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither EQT's independent
registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with
respect to the unaudited prospective financial and operating information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any
other form of assurance on such information or its achievability. The report of the independent registered public accounting firm to EQT
contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is incorporated by reference into this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, relates to historical financial information of EQT, and such report does not extend to the projections included
below and should not be read to do so.

        Furthermore, the unaudited prospective financial and operating information does not take into account any circumstances or events
occurring after the date it was prepared. EQT and Rice can give no assurance that, had the unaudited prospective financial and operating
information been prepared either as of the date of the merger agreement or as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, similar
estimates and assumptions would be used. Except as required by applicable securities laws, EQT and Rice do not intend to, and disclaim
any obligation to, make publicly available any update or other revision to the unaudited prospective financial and operating information to
reflect circumstances existing since their preparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all
of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error, including with respect to the accounting treatment of the merger under GAAP, or
to reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions. The unaudited prospective financial and operating information does not take
into account all the possible financial and other effects on EQT or Rice of the merger, the effect on EQT or Rice of any business or
strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed, or the effect of any
business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but which
were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger. Further, the unaudited prospective financial and
operating information does not take into account the effect on EQT or Rice of any possible failure of the merger to occur. None of EQT,
Rice, or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made, makes or is authorized in the future to
make any representation to any EQT shareholder or Rice stockholder or other person regarding EQT's or Rice's ultimate performance
compared to the information contained in the unaudited prospective financial and operating information or that the forecasted results will
be achieved. The inclusion of the unaudited prospective financial and operating information herein should not be deemed an admission or
representation by EQT, Rice, their respective advisors or any other person that it is viewed as material information of EQT or Rice,
particularly in light of the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such forecasts. The summary of the unaudited prospective

information included below is not being included to influence your decision whether to vote in favor of the merger, the share issuance or
any other proposal to be considered at the special meetings, but is being provided solely because it was made available to the EQT board,
Rice and EQT's and Rice's respective financial advisors in connection with the merger.

        In light of the foregoing, and considering that the special meetings will be held several months after the unaudited prospective
financial and operating information was prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasted information, EQT shareholders
and Rice stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such information, and EQT and Rice urge all EQT shareholders and
Rice stockholders to review EQT's most recent SEC filings for a description of EQT's reported financial results and Rice's most recent
SEC filings for a description of Rice's reported financial results. See the section titled "Where You Can Find More Information."

        The EQT prospective financial information summarized above, which was provided to the EQT board and Citi, incorporated certain
updated assumptions regarding general and administrative expenses as compared to the version of such prospective financial information
provided to Rice and Barclays. These updates resulted in the projections for each of EBITDAX and unlevered free cash flow provided to
Rice and Barclays being approximately $24 million higher in 2017 and $11 million higher in 2018-2021 than the amounts set forth above.

        In addition, EQT management provided to the EQT board, Rice and Rice's financial advisor certain estimates of the amounts and
timing of the cost savings and operational synergies anticipated by EQT management to result from the merger during the calendar year
ending December 31, 2018 through the calendar year ending December 31, 2026, which consisted of EQT prepared estimates of annual
cost synergies of $100 million (which amount EQT management rounded from, and which amount was not duplicative of, the $93 million
of annual corporate general and administrative benefits reflected in the Expected Development and Cost Savings described below)
expected to be realized following the closing in 2018 and beyond (such estimated annual cost savings, the "Expected Synergies"). The
Expected Synergies also were provided to Citi for its use and reliance in connection with its opinion and related financial analyses
described in the section entitled "—Opinion of EQT's Financial Advisor."

        EQT management provided to the EQT board certain estimates of the potential strategic implications and financial and operational
benefits which EQT management anticipated to result from the mergers during the calendar year ending December 31, 2018 through the
calendar year ending December 31, 2026 (collectively, the "Expected Development and Cost Savings"). The Expected Development and
Cost Savings also were provided to Citi for its use and reliance in connection with its opinion and related financial analyses. The Expected
Development and Cost Savings included assumptions of (i) development synergies of approximately $333 million in 2018, $448 million
in 2019, $283 million in 2020, $244 million in 2021, $379 million in 2022, $371 million in 2023, $406 million in 2024, $33 million
in 2025 and $0 in 2026 and (ii) corporate general and administrative benefits per year in 2018-2026 of approximately $93 million. The
assumptions described in the preceding sentence reflected no potential midstream benefits and no benefits attributable to upside potential
identified by EQT management that could potentially be achieved from drilling and completion best practices, buying power, marketing
optimization, upstream lifting and operating expense optimization, lengthening West Virginia laterals, perpetuity general and
administrative savings or accelerated expansion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline.

        In addition, EQT management provided to the EQT board certain unaudited prospective financial and operating information with
respect to Rice, which was generally derived from the information provided by Rice management and summarized in this joint proxy
statement under the caption "—Certain Rice Unaudited Prospective Financial and Operating Information," except that EQT management
adjusted the information provided by Rice management in order to harmonize certain of the assumptions underlying such information with

prospective financial and operating information regarding Rice for the years 2017 through 2021 as prepared by EQT management.

Certain Rice Unaudited Prospective Financial and Operating Information 

        Rice does not as a matter of course make public long-term forecasts or internal projections as to future performance, revenues,
production, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However,
in connection with its evaluation of the merger, Rice's management prepared certain unaudited internal financial forecasts with respect to
Rice, which were provided to the Rice board and EQT, as well as Rice's and EQT's respective financial advisors, in connection with their
evaluation of the proposed merger. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that any of EQT, Rice, their
respective advisors or other representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be necessarily
predictive of actual future performance or events, or that it should be construed as financial guidance, and such summary projections set
forth below should not be relied on as such.

        This information was prepared solely for internal use and is subjective in many respects. While presented with numeric specificity,
the unaudited prospective financial and operating information reflects numerous estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain
and may be beyond the control of Rice's management, including, among others, Rice's and EQT's future results, oil and gas industry
activity, commodity prices, demand for natural gas and crude oil, the availability of financing to fund the exploration and development
costs associated with the respective projected drilling programs, general economic and regulatory conditions and other matters described
in the sections entitled "Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors." The unaudited prospective
financial and operating information reflects both assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and, in many
respects, subjective judgment, and thus is susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and
business developments. Rice and EQT can give no assurance that the unaudited prospective financial and operating information and the
underlying estimates and assumptions will be realized. In addition, since the unaudited prospective financial and operating information
covers multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. Actual results may differ

into account all the possible financial and other effects on Rice or EQT of the merger, the effect on Rice of any business or strategic
decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or
strategic decisions or actions which would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but which were instead
altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger. Further, the unaudited prospective financial and operating
information does not take into account the effect on Rice or EQT of any possible failure of the merger to occur. None of EQT, Rice, or
their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made, makes or is authorized in the future to make any
representation to any Rice stockholder or EQT shareholder or other person regarding Rice's or EQT's ultimate performance compared to
the information contained in the unaudited prospective financial and operating information or that the forecasted results will be achieved.
The inclusion of the unaudited prospective financial and operating information herein should not be deemed an admission or
representation by EQT, Rice, their respective advisors or any other person that it is viewed as material information of Rice or EQT,
particularly in light of the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such forecasts. The summary of the unaudited prospective
financial and operating information included below is not being included to influence your decision whether to vote in favor of the merger,
the share issuance or any other proposal to be considered at the special meetings, but is being provided solely because it was made
available to the Rice board, EQT, and Rice's and EQT's respective financial advisors in connection with the merger.

financial and operating information was prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasted information, Rice stockholders

Rice's most recent SEC filings for a description of Rice's reported financial results and EQT's most recent SEC filings for a description of
EQT's reported financial results. See the section titled "Where You Can Find More Information."

        Rice's Pricing Assumptions.    In preparing the prospective financial and operating information for Rice and EQT described below, the
management team of Rice used the following price assumptions, which are based on NYMEX oil and gas strip pricing as of May 11, 2017:

        Rice Management Projections.    The following tables set forth certain summarized prospective financial and operating information
regarding each of Rice's three reporting segments for the years 2017 through 2021—based on the respective price assumptions indicated
above—which information was prepared by Rice management, which are collectively referred to as the "Rice Projections for Rice." The
financial information below is reported in the following segments: (i) the E&P segment, which is engaged in the acquisition, exploration
and development of natural gas, oil and NGLs, (ii) the RMH segment, which is engaged in the gathering and compression of natural gas
production in Belmont and Monroe Counties, Ohio and (iii) the RMP segment, which is engaged in the gathering and compression of
natural gas production in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and in the provision of water services to support the well
completion services of Rice and third parties in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and in Belmont County, Ohio.

        The EBITDA and Cash Flow From Operations forecasts for Rice presented above were adjusted for use in the financial analyses
performed by Barclays. Adjusted EBITDA reflects the EBITDA from the E&P segment, the EBITDA from the RMH segment and the
cash distributions earned from the common units, subordinated units and incentive distribution rights Rice owns in RMP. Adjusted Cash
Flow from Operations reflects the Cash Flow from Operations from the E&P segment, the Cash Flow from Operations from the RMH
segment and the cash distributions earned from the common units, subordinated units and incentive distribution rights it owns in RMP. The
following table presents a summary of such adjusted forecasts for Rice for the same periods reflected above, on a consolidated basis:

Opinion of EQT's Financial Advisor 

        EQT has engaged Citi to act as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed mergers. In connection with Citi's engagement,
the EQT board requested that Citi evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be paid by EQT
pursuant to the merger agreement. On June 19, 2017, at a meeting of the EQT board held to evaluate the proposed mergers, Citi rendered
an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated June 19, 2017, to the EQT board to the effect that, as of such date and
based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the
review undertaken, the merger consideration to be paid by EQT pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view,
to EQT.

        The full text of Citi's written opinion, dated June 19, 2017, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
and is incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. The description of Citi's opinion set forth below is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full text of Citi's opinion. Citi's opinion was provided for the information of the EQT board (in its
capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view and did not address
any other terms, aspects or implications of the mergers or related transactions. Citi expressed no view as to, and its opinion did not
address, the underlying business decision of EQT to effect or enter into the mergers or any related transactions, the relative merits
of the mergers or any related transactions as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for EQT or the effect
of any other transaction in which EQT might engage or consider. Citi's opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a
recommendation to any securityholder as to how such securityholder should vote or act on any matters relating to the proposed
mergers, any related transactions or otherwise.

        In arriving at its opinion, Citi:

• reviewed an execution version of the merger agreement, provided to Citi on June 19, 2017; 

• held discussions with certain senior officers, directors and other representatives of EQT and certain senior officers and
other representatives of Rice concerning the businesses, operations and prospects of EQT and Rice; 

• reviewed certain publicly available and other business and financial information relating to EQT and Rice provided to or
discussed with Citi by the respective managements of EQT and Rice,

including certain internal financial forecasts and other information and data relating to EQT provided to or discussed with
Citi by the management of EQT and certain financial forecasts and other information and data relating to Rice provided to
or discussed with Citi by the managements of EQT and Rice and as adjusted by the management of EQT;

• reviewed certain information and data relating to the potential strategic implications and financial and operational benefits
(including the amount, timing and achievability thereof) anticipated by the management of EQT to result from the mergers;

• reviewed the financial terms of the mergers as set forth in the merger agreement in relation to, among other things, current
and historical market prices of EQT common stock and Rice common stock, the financial condition and historical and
projected cash flows and other operating data of EQT and Rice and the capitalization of EQT and Rice; 

• analyzed certain financial, stock market and other publicly available information relating to the businesses of other
companies whose operations Citi considered relevant in evaluating those of EQT and Rice; 

• evaluated certain potential pro forma financial effects of the mergers on EQT utilizing the financial forecasts and other
information and data relating to EQT and Rice and the potential strategic implications and financial and operational
benefits referred to above; and 

• conducted such other analyses and examinations and considered such other information and financial, economic and
market criteria as Citi deemed appropriate in arriving at its opinion.

        In rendering its opinion, Citi assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of all
financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with Citi and upon the
assurances of the managements and other representatives of EQT and Rice that they were not aware of any relevant information that was
omitted or that remained undisclosed to Citi. With respect to the financial forecasts and other information and data (including tax rate
assumptions and adjustments to the financial forecasts and other information and data relating to Rice prepared by the management of
EQT) that Citi was directed to utilize in its analyses, Citi was advised by the respective managements of EQT and Rice, and Citi assumed,
with EQT's consent, that such forecasts and other information and data were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of such managements, as the case may be, as to, and were a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate,
the future financial performance of EQT and Rice, the potential strategic implications and financial and operational benefits (including the
amount, timing and achievability thereof) anticipated by the management of EQT to result from, and other potential pro forma financial
effects of, the mergers and the other matters covered thereby. Citi expressed no opinion as to any financial and other information or data
(or underlying assumptions on which any such financial and other information or data are based) provided to or otherwise reviewed by or
discussed with Citi and Citi assumed, with EQT's consent, that the financial results, including with respect to the potential strategic
implications and financial and operational benefits anticipated to result from the mergers, reflected in such financial forecasts and other
information and data would be realized in the amounts and at the times projected.

        Citi relied, at EQT's direction, upon the assessments of the managements of EQT and Rice as to, among other things, (i) the
redemption of certain securities of subsidiaries of Rice contemplated by the merger agreement and the other transaction related to the
mergers, including with respect to the timing thereof and assets, liabilities and financial and other terms involved, (ii) the potential impact
on EQT and Rice of market, competitive and other trends and developments in and prospects for, and governmental, regulatory and
legislative matters relating to or otherwise affecting, the natural gas, oil and natural gas liquid and energy infrastructure industries,
including commodity pricing and supply and demand for natural gas, oil and natural gas liquid, which are subject to significant volatility
and which, if different than as assumed, could have a material impact on Citi's analyses or opinion, (iii) natural gas, oil and natural gas
liquid reserves and growth, expansion and other development and exploration

involved, (iv) existing and future contracts and relationships, agreements and arrangements with, and the ability to attract, retain and/or
replace, key lessors, employees, customers, derivatives counterparties and other commercial relationships of EQT and Rice and (v) the
ability to integrate the operations of EQT and Rice. Citi assumed, with EQT's consent, that there would be no developments with respect
to any such matters that would be meaningful in any respect to Citi's analyses or opinion.

        Citi did not make, and it was not provided with, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent, accrued,
derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise) of EQT, Rice or any other entity and Citi did not make any physical inspection of the properties
or assets of EQT, Rice or any other entity. Citi assumed, with EQT's consent, that the mergers and related transactions would be
consummated in accordance with their respective terms and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements,
without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement, and that there would not be any delays,
limitations, restrictions, conditions or other actions, including any divestitures or other requirements, amendments or modifications, in the
course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals, consents, releases, waivers and agreements for the
mergers or related transactions that would be meaningful in any respect to Citi's analyses or opinion. Citi also assumed, with EQT's
consent, that the merger and the post-closing merger, taken together, would qualify for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. Citi did not express any view or opinion as to the actual value of EQT
common stock or any other securities when issued, redeemed or acquired in connection with the mergers and related transactions or the
prices at which EQT common stock, Rice common stock or any other securities will trade or otherwise be transferable at any time,
including following the announcement or consummation of the mergers and related transactions. Representatives of EQT advised Citi, and
Citi further assumed, that the final terms of the merger agreement did not vary materially from those set forth in the execution version
reviewed by Citi. Citi did not express any view or opinion with respect to accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters and relied,
with EQT's consent, upon the assessments of representatives of EQT as to such matters.

        Citi's opinion did not address any terms (other than the merger consideration to the extent expressly specified therein) or other aspects
or implications of the mergers or related transactions, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the mergers, the form or
structure, or financial or other terms, of any related transactions or any terms, aspects or implications of any voting or non-competition
agreement or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding to be entered into in connection with or contemplated by the mergers,
related transactions or otherwise. Citi expressed no view as to, and its opinion did not address, the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the
amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation or other payments to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the
mergers or any related transactions, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. Citi's opinion was
necessarily based upon information available, and financial, stock market and other conditions and circumstances existing and disclosed,
to Citi as of the date of its opinion. Although subsequent developments may affect its opinion, Citi is not obligated to update, revise or
reaffirm its opinion. As the EQT board was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets, and the industries in which EQT and Rice
operate, have experienced and continue to experience volatility and Citi expressed no opinion or view as to any potential effects of such
volatility on EQT, Rice or the mergers (including the contemplated benefits thereof) or related transactions. The issuance of Citi's opinion
was authorized by Citi's fairness opinion committee.

        In preparing its opinion, Citi performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those described below. The
summary of the analyses below is not a complete description of Citi's opinion or the analyses underlying, and factors considered in
connection with, Citi's opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as
to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances
and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary

description. Citi arrived at its ultimate opinion based on the results of all analyses and factors assessed as a whole, and it did not draw, in
isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis. Accordingly, Citi believes that the analyses must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format,
without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of
the processes underlying such analyses and its opinion.

        In its analyses, Citi considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters
existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of EQT and Rice. No company, business or transaction
reviewed is identical or directly comparable to EQT or Rice or the mergers and an evaluation of these analyses is not entirely
mathematical; rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and
other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions reviewed
or the results from any particular analysis.

        The estimates contained in Citi's analyses and the ranges resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such analyses.
In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which
businesses or securities actually may be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Citi's analyses
are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

        Citi was not requested to, and it did not, recommend or determine the specific consideration payable in the mergers. The type and
amount of consideration payable in the mergers were determined through negotiations between EQT and Rice and the decision to enter
into the merger agreement was solely that of the EQT board. Citi's opinion was only one of many factors considered by the EQT board in
its evaluation of the mergers and related transactions and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the EQT board or EQT
management with respect to the mergers, related transactions or the merger consideration.

Financial Analyses

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared and reviewed with the EQT board in connection with Citi's
opinion, dated June 19, 2017. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses
performed by, and underlying the opinion of, Citi, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative
importance or weight given to those financial analyses by Citi. Certain financial analyses summarized below include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of
each summary as the tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in the
tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the financial analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such financial analyses. Citi
assumes no responsibility if future results are different from those described, whether or not any such difference is material.

        For purposes of the financial analyses described below, (i) the term "EBITDA" refers to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, (ii) the term "implied merger consideration" refers to an implied consideration of $27.04 per outstanding share of Rice
common stock based on the merger consideration of $5.30 in cash and 0.37 of a share of EQT common stock utilizing, for the stock
portion of the consideration, the closing price per share of EQT common stock on June 16, 2017 of $58.77 and (iii) approximate implied
per share equity value reference ranges derived for each of Rice, EQT and the pro forma combined company were based on fully diluted
shares outstanding (assuming, among other things, the conversion of outstanding in-the-money equity awards) as provided by the
respective managements of Rice and EQT. Financial data for EQT and Rice utilized in the financial

analyses described below were based on, among other things, internal forecasts and estimates relating to EQT prepared by the
management of EQT (referred to in this section as the "EQT forecasts") and forecasts and estimates relating to Rice prepared by the
management of Rice and as adjusted by the management of EQT (referred to in this section as the "adjusted Rice forecasts").

        Approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges derived from the financial analyses described below were rounded to
the nearest $0.05, other than such ranges derived from historical stock trading histories and Wall Street research analysts' stock price
targets. Approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges derived for each of Rice and EQT on a standalone basis may not be
reflective of Rice's and EQT's relative values.

Rice Financial Analyses

        Rice Selected Public Companies Analyses.    Citi performed selected public companies analyses of Rice both on a consolidated and
sum-of-the-parts basis in which Citi reviewed certain financial and stock market information relating to Rice and the selected publicly
traded companies or partnerships listed below.

        In its selected public companies analysis of Rice on a consolidated basis, Citi reviewed certain financial and stock market information
relating to Rice and the following five selected companies that Citi considered generally relevant as publicly traded companies with
significant upstream energy operations and associated midstream operations (as applicable) primarily in the Appalachian region
(collectively, the "Rice selected companies"):

• Antero Resources Corporation 

• Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation 

• EQT Corporation 

• Gulfport Energy Corporation 

• Range Resources Corporation

        Citi reviewed, among other information, enterprise values, calculated as implied equity values based on closing stock prices on
June 16, 2017, plus total debt, preferred equity and minority interests (as applicable) and less cash and cash equivalents, deconsolidated (as
applicable) for total debt and cash and cash equivalents of controlled master limited partnerships ("MLPs"), as a multiple of calendar year
2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated upstream and retained midstream EBITDA plus distributions from MLPs (as applicable) and
closing stock prices on June 16, 2017 as a multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated cash flow per share. Financial
data of the Rice selected companies were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates, public filings and other
publicly available information. Financial data of Rice was based on the adjusted Rice forecasts and public filings.

        The overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples observed for the Rice selected
companies were 4.8x to 9.9x (with a median of 8.0x) and 3.6x to 7.8x (with a median of 6.5x), respectively, and the overall low to high
calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated cash flow per share multiples observed for the Rice selected companies were 3.5x to
9.7x (with a median of 8.6x) and 2.6x to 8.1x (with a median of 5.5x), respectively. Citi noted that the calendar year 2017 and calendar
year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples for Rice were 7.4x and 5.7x, respectively, and the calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018
estimated cash flow per share multiples for Rice were 6.3x and 4.8x, respectively. Citi then applied selected ranges of calendar year 2017
and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples derived from the Rice selected companies of 7.2x to 8.8x and 5.7x to 7.1x,
respectively, to corresponding data of Rice and selected ranges of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated cash flow per share
multiples derived from the Rice selected companies of 6.3x to 9.5x and 4.8x to 6.0x, respectively, to corresponding data of Rice. This

indicated the following selected average approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Rice, as compared to the implied
merger consideration:

        Citi also performed a selected public companies analysis of Rice on a sum-of-the-parts basis to observe an approximate implied per
share equity value reference range for Rice based on approximate implied values for (i) Rice's upstream business (the "Rice upstream
business"), (ii) Rice's retained midstream assets (the "Rice retained midstream business"), (iii) Rice's limited partner interests in RMP
("Rice's LP interests") and (iv) Rice's general partner interests and related incentive distribution rights ("GP/IDRs") in RMP
("Rice's GP/IDR interests").

        In evaluating the Rice upstream business, Citi reviewed certain financial and stock market information, as applicable, relating to the
Rice upstream business and the following three selected companies that Citi considered generally relevant as publicly traded companies
with significant upstream energy operations and associated midstream operations (as applicable) primarily in the Appalachian region but
with no affiliated publicly traded MLPs (collectively, the "selected upstream companies"):

• Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation 

• Gulfport Energy Corporation 

• Range Resources Corporation

        Citi reviewed, among other information, enterprise values, calculated as implied equity values based on closing stock prices on
June 16, 2017, plus total debt, preferred equity and minority interests (as applicable) and less cash and cash equivalents, deconsolidated (as
applicable) for total debt and cash and cash equivalents of controlled MLPs, as a multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018
estimated upstream EBITDA and upstream enterprise values, calculated as implied equity values based on closing stock prices on June 16,
2017, plus total debt, preferred equity and minority interests (as applicable) and less cash and cash equivalents, deconsolidated (as
applicable) for total debt and cash and cash equivalents of controlled MLPs, and the value of assets other than upstream assets (as
applicable), as a multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated production. Financial data of the selected upstream
companies were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates, public filings and other publicly available
information. Financial data of the Rice upstream business was based on the adjusted Rice forecasts and public filings.

        The overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples observed for the selected upstream
companies were 4.8x to 9.5x (with a median of 8.0x) and 3.6x to 7.8x (with a median of 6.4x), respectively, and the overall low to high
calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated production multiples observed for the selected upstream companies were
$3,380/Mcfe/d to $6,139/Mcfe/d (with a median of $4,633/Mcfe/d) and $2,442/Mcfe/d to $5,171/Mcfe/d (with a median of
$3,829/Mcfe/d), respectively. Citi then applied selected ranges of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples
derived from the selected upstream companies of 7.2x to 8.8x and 5.8x to 7.0x, respectively, to corresponding data of the Rice upstream
business and selected ranges of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated production multiples derived from the selected
upstream companies of $4,170/Mcfe/d to $5,096/Mcfe/d and $3,446/Mcfe/d to $4,212/Mcfe/d, respectively, to corresponding data of the
Rice upstream business. This analysis indicated a selected average approximate implied value reference range for the Rice upstream
business of $5,610 million to $6,860 million.

Rice forecasts. The present value (as of June 30, 2017) of cash flows was calculated using a selected range of discount rates of 8.6% to
10.1%. This analysis indicated a selected approximate implied value reference range for the Rice retained midstream business of
$965 million to $980 million.

        In evaluating Rice's LP interests, Citi reviewed certain financial and stock market information relating to RMP and the following six
selected partnerships that Citi considered generally relevant as publicly traded midstream MLPs with upstream sponsors (collectively, the
"RMP selected midstream partnerships"):

• Antero Midstream Partners LP 

• CONE Midstream Partners LP 

• EnLink Midstream Partners, LP 

• EQT Midstream Partners, LP 

• Noble Midstream Partners LP 

• Western Gas Partners, LP

        Citi reviewed, among other information, enterprise values, calculated as implied equity values based on closing limited partner unit
prices on June 16, 2017, plus total debt, preferred equity and minority interests (as applicable) and less cash and cash equivalents, as a
multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA and closing limited partner unit prices on June 16, 2017 as a
multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated distributable cash flow per limited partner unit. Citi also reviewed
indicative yields, calculated as the most recently announced quarterly distribution per unit, as annualized, divided by the closing limited
partner unit price on June 16, 2017, and calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated yields. Financial data of the RMP selected
midstream partnerships were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates, public filings and other publicly
available information. Financial data of RMP was based on the adjusted Rice forecasts and public filings.

        The overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples, calendar year 2017 and calendar
year 2018 estimated distributable cash flow per limited partner unit multiples, indicative yields and calendar year 2017 and calendar year
2018 estimated yields observed for the RMP selected midstream partnerships were as follows:

• calendar year 2017 estimated EBITDA multiples: 13.6x to 19.4x (with a mean of 16.3x and a median of 16.5x) 

• calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples: 10.2x to 15.5x (with a mean of 12.9x and a median of 12.8x) 

• calendar year 2017 estimated distributable cash flow per limited partner unit multiples: 10.1x to 18.9x (with a mean of
14.6x and a median of 14.5x) 

• calendar year 2018 estimated distributable cash flow per limited partner unit multiples: 9.6x to 15.2x (with a mean of 13.0x
and a median of 13.9x) 

• indicative yields: 3.6% to 9.8% (with a mean of 5.8% and a median of 5.6%) 

• calendar year 2017 estimated yields: 3.8% to 9.8% (with a mean and a median of 6.0%) 

• calendar year 2018 estimated yields: 4.6% to 9.9% (with a mean of 6.8% and a median of 6.7%)

        Citi noted that the calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples for RMP were 18.0x and 11.0x,
respectively, the calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated distributable cash flow per limited partner unit multiples for RMP
were 17.6x and 13.3x, respectively, the indicative yield for RMP was 4.3% and the calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated
yields for RMP were 4.5% and 5.5%, respectively. Citi then applied the following selected ranges of

• calendar year 2017 estimated yields: 6.6% to 4.5% 

• calendar year 2018 estimated yields: 7.4% to 5.5%

        This analysis indicated a selected average approximate implied value reference range for Rice's LP interests of $507 million to
$699 million.

        In evaluating Rice's GP/IDR interests, Citi reviewed certain financial and stock market information relating to RMP and the
following seven selected companies or partnerships that Citi considered generally relevant as publicly traded companies or partnerships
that are general partners of affiliated MLPs with midstream energy operations (collectively, the "selected GP companies"):

• Antero Midstream GP LP 

• Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. 

• EnLink Midstream, LLC 

• EQT GP Holdings, LP 

• NuStar GP Holdings, LLC 

• Tallgrass Energy GP, LP 

• Western Gas Equity Partners, LP

        Citi reviewed, among other information, enterprise values, calculated as implied equity values based on closing share or unit prices
on June 16, 2017, plus total debt, preferred equity and minority interests (as applicable) and less cash and cash equivalents and less the
value of assets other than GP/IDRs, as a multiple of calendar year 2018 and calendar year 2019 estimated post-tax GP/IDR cash flows.
Financial data of the selected GP companies were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates, public filings and
other publicly available information. Financial data of RMP was based on the adjusted Rice forecasts and public filings.

        The overall low to high calendar year 2018 and calendar year 2019 estimated GP/IDR cash flow multiples observed for the
selected GP companies were 8.6x to 48.9x (with a median of 19.4x) and 7.0x to 29.8x (with a median of 13.9x), respectively. Citi then
applied selected ranges of calendar year 2018 and calendar year 2019 estimated GP/IDR cash flow multiples derived from the selected GP
companies of 23.7x to 48.9x and 18.5x to 29.8x, respectively, to corresponding data of RMP. This analysis indicated a selected average
approximate implied value reference range for Rice's GP/IDR interests of $885 million to $1,583 million.

        Citi reviewed, among other information, transaction values for the Rice selected GP transactions based on the consideration paid in
the relevant transaction, adjusted for the acquisition value of other assets or MLP interests acquired concurrently with such transaction, as
a multiple, to the extent publicly available, of the applicable target entity's next 12 months estimated GP/IDR cash flows as of the date of
announcement of the relevant transaction. Financial data of the Rice selected GP transactions were based on publicly available Wall Street
research analysts' estimates and public filings. Financial data of RMP was based on the adjusted Rice forecasts and public filings.

        The overall low to high next 12 months estimated GP/IDR cash flow multiples observed for the Rice selected GP transactions were
8.1x to 59.2x (with a mean of 21.7x and a median of 17.0x). Citi then applied a selected range of next 12 months estimated GP/IDR cash
flow multiples derived from the Rice selected GP transactions of 43.2x to 59.2x to the next 12 months (as of June 30, 2017)

        Citi also performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Rice on a sum-of-the-parts basis to observe an approximate implied per share
equity value reference range for Rice based on approximate implied values for (i) the Rice upstream business, (ii) the Rice retained
midstream business, (iii) Rice's LP interests and (iv) Rice's GP/IDR interests.

        In evaluating the Rice upstream business, Citi performed a net asset value analysis of the Rice upstream business by calculating the
estimated present value of the unlevered free cash flows that the Rice upstream business was expected to generate during the last six
months of the calendar year ending December 31, 2017 through the full calendar year ending December 31, 2067 based on the adjusted
Rice forecasts and forward pricing curve of oil and gas commodity prices reported on the NYMEX as of May 11, 2017 per EQT
management. The present value (as of June 30, 2017) of cash flows was calculated using selected discount rates of 7.9% and 9.2% after
taking into account risk adjustments for the number of locations drilled, capital expenditures for drilling and completing wells and actual
resource recovery amount per EQT management. This analysis indicated a selected approximate implied post-tax value reference range for
the Rice upstream business of $8,933 million to $10,162 million.

        In evaluating the Rice retained midstream business, Citi performed the discounted cash flow analysis of the Rice retained midstream
business described above under "—Rice Selected Public Companies Analysis."

        In evaluating Rice's LP interests, Citi performed a discounted cash flow analysis of limited partner interests in RMP by calculating
the estimated present value of the distributable cash flow per limited partner unit that RMP was expected to generate during the last six
months of the calendar year ending December 31, 2017 through the full calendar year ending December 31, 2021 based on the adjusted
Rice forecasts. Citi calculated implied terminal values for limited partner interests in RMP by applying to RMP's calendar year 2021
estimated distributable cash flow per limited partner unit a selected range of distributable cash flow per limited partner unit multiples of
13.1x to 17.6x. The present values (as of June 30, 2017) of distributable cash flow per limited partner unit and terminal values were then
calculated using a selected range of discount rates of 9.2% to 11.3%. This analysis indicated a selected approximate implied post-tax value
reference range for Rice's LP interests of $819 million to $1,107 million.

        In evaluating Rice's GP/IDR interests, Citi performed a discounted cash flow analysis of GP/IDR interests in RMP by calculating the
estimated present value of the GP/IDR cash flows that RMP was expected to generate during the last six months of the calendar year
ending December 31, 2017 through the full calendar year ending December 31, 2021 based on the adjusted Rice forecasts. Citi calculated
implied terminal values for GP/IDR interests in RMP by applying to RMP's calendar year 2021 estimated GP/IDR cash flows a selected
range of GP/IDR cash flow multiples of 22.3x to 26.8x. The present values (as of June 30, 2017) of GP/IDR cash flows and terminal
values were then calculated using a selected range of discount rates of 9.3% to 11.3%. This analysis indicated a selected approximate
implied post-tax value reference range for Rice's GP/IDR interests of $1,509 million to $1,913 million.

        The analyses described above of the Rice upstream business, the Rice retained midstream business, Rice's LP interests and
Rice's GP/IDR interests indicated the following selected approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Rice, as compared
to the implied merger consideration:

EQT Financial Analyses

        EQT Selected Public Companies Analyses.    Citi performed selected public companies analyses of EQT both on a consolidated and
sum-of-the-parts basis in which Citi reviewed certain financial and stock market information relating to EQT and the selected publicly
traded companies or partnerships listed or referred to below.

        In its selected public companies analysis of EQT on a consolidated basis, Citi reviewed certain financial and stock market
information relating to EQT and the following five selected companies that Citi considered generally relevant as publicly traded
companies with significant upstream energy operations and associated midstream operations (as applicable) primarily in the Appalachian
region (collectively, the "EQT selected companies"):

• Antero Resources Corporation 

• Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation 

• Gulfport Energy Corporation 

• Range Resources Corporation 

• Rice Energy Inc.

        Citi reviewed, among other information, enterprise values (calculated as described above for Rice on a consolidated basis under "—
Rice Financial Analyses—Rice Selected Public Companies Analyses") as a multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018
estimated upstream and retained midstream EBITDA plus distributions from controlled MLPs (as applicable) and closing stock prices on
June 16, 2017 as a multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated cash flow per share. Financial data of the EQT
selected companies were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates, public filings and other publicly available
information. Financial data of EQT was based on the EQT forecasts and public filings.

        The overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples observed for the EQT selected
companies were 4.8x to 9.9x (with a median of 8.0x) and 3.6x to 7.8x (with a median of 6.4x), respectively, and the overall low to high
calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated cash flow per share multiples observed for the EQT selected companies were 3.5x to
9.7x (with a median of 5.8x) and 2.6x to 8.1x (with a median of 4.5x), respectively. Citi noted that the calendar year 2017 and calendar
year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples for EQT were 7.6x and 7.5x, respectively, and the calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018
estimated cash flow per share multiples for EQT were 7.8x and 7.3x, respectively. Citi then applied selected ranges of calendar year 2017
and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples derived from the EQT selected companies of 7.2x to 8.8x and 5.8x to 7.5x,
respectively, to corresponding data of EQT and selected ranges of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated cash flow per
share multiples derived from the EQT selected companies of 5.2x to 7.8x and 4.1x to 7.3x, respectively, to corresponding data of EQT.
This analysis indicated the following selected average approximate implied per share equity value reference range for EQT, as compared
to the closing price per share of EQT common stock on June 16, 2017:

        Citi also performed a selected public companies analysis of EQT on a sum-of-the-parts basis to observe an approximate implied per
share equity value reference range for EQT based on approximate implied values for (i) EQT's upstream business (the "EQT upstream
business") and (ii) EQT's interests in EQGP.

        In evaluating the EQT upstream business, Citi reviewed certain financial and stock market information, as applicable, relating to the
EQT upstream business and the selected upstream companies. Citi reviewed, among other information, enterprise values (calculated as
described above for the Rice upstream business under "—Rice Financial Analyses—Rice Selected Public Companies Analyses") as a
multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated upstream EBITDA and upstream enterprise values (calculated as
described above for the Rice upstream business under "—Rice Financial Analyses—Rice Selected Public Companies Analyses") as a
multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated production. Financial data of the selected upstream companies were
based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates, public filings and other publicly available information. Financial data
of the EQT upstream business was based on the EQT forecasts and public filings.

        The overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples and calendar year 2017 and calendar
year 2018 estimated production multiples observed for the selected upstream companies were as described above for the Rice upstream
business under "—Rice Financial Analyses—Rice Selected Public Companies Analyses." Citi then applied the selected ranges of calendar
year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples and calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated production
multiples derived from the selected upstream companies described above under "—Rice Financial Analyses—Rice Selected Public
Companies Analyses" to corresponding data of the EQT upstream business. This analysis indicated a selected average approximate
implied value reference range for the EQT upstream business of $9,015 million to $11,020 million.

        In evaluating EQT's interests in EQGP, Citi reviewed certain financial and stock market information relating to EQGP and the
selected GP companies (excluding EQGP). Citi reviewed, among other information, calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated
yields. Financial data of the selected GP companies were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates, public filings
and other publicly available information. Financial data of EQGP was based on the EQT forecasts and public filings.

        The overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated yields observed for the selected GP companies were
1.5% to 9.1% (with a median of 6.1%) and 2.0% to 9.1% (with a median of 7.2%), respectively. Citi noted that the calendar year 2017 and
calendar year 2018 estimated yields for EQGP were 3.6% and 4.6%, respectively. Citi then applied selected ranges of calendar year 2017
and calendar year 2018 estimated yields derived from the selected GP companies of 3.6% to 2.8% and 4.6% to 3.4%, respectively, to
calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 distributions per unit of EQGP. This analysis indicated a selected average approximate implied
value reference range for EQT's interests in EQGP of $5,981 million to $7,875 million.

        The analyses described above of the EQT upstream business and EQT's interests in EQGP indicated the following selected
approximate implied per share equity value reference range for EQT (which does not reflect potential costs and dis-synergies, relating to
taxes or otherwise, that may be incurred in order to separate EQT's businesses), as compared to the closing price per share of EQT
common stock on June 16, 2017:

        Has/Gets Analysis.    Citi compared approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges derived for the pro forma combined
company both on a consolidated and sum-of-the-parts basis relative to the approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges
derived for EQT both on a consolidated and sum-of-the-parts basis in the discounted cash flow analyses of EQT described above under
"—EQT Financial Analyses—EQT Discounted Cash Flow Analyses" to illustrate the potential value uplift for EQT that could result from
the mergers both before and after taking into account the Expected Development and Cost Savings. Financial data of Rice was based on
the adjusted Rice forecasts and public filings. Financial data of the pro forma combined company was based on the EQT forecasts, the
adjusted Rice forecasts and public filings.

        Citi observed an illustrative approximate implied per share equity value reference range for the pro forma combined company on a
consolidated basis derived from a discounted cash flow analysis of the pro forma combined company applying the selected ranges of
calendar year 2021 estimated EBITDA multiples and discount rates described above for EQT on a consolidated basis under "—EQT
Financial Analyses—EQT Discounted Cash Flow Analyses."

        Citi also observed an illustrative approximate implied per share equity value reference range for the pro forma combined company on
a sum-of-the-parts basis based on approximate implied values for (i) the EQT upstream business, (ii) the Rice upstream business, (iii) the
Rice retained midstream business, (iv) Rice's LP interests, (v) EQT's interests in EQGP and (vi) Rice's GP/IDR interests derived from:

• EQT upstream business and Rice upstream business: the net asset value analyses of such businesses described above under
"—EQT Financial Analyses—EQT Discounted Cash Flow Analyses" and "—Rice Financial Analyses—Rice Discounted
Cash Flow Analyses," in each case applying the selected discount rates for the EQT upstream business 

• Rice retained midstream business: a discounted cash flow analysis of such business on a pro forma basis applying a
selected range of EBITDA multiples of 8.0x to 9.8x and the selected range of discount rates described above for the Rice
retained midstream business under "—Rice Financial Analyses—Rice Selected Public Companies Analyses" 

• Rice's LP interests: a discounted cash flow analysis of such interests on a pro forma basis applying the selected ranges of
distributable cash flow per limited partner unit multiples and discount rates described above for Rice's LP interests under
"—Rice Financial Analyses—Rice Discounted Cash Flow Analyses" 

• EQT's interests in EQGP: the discounted cash flow analysis of such interests described above under "—EQT Financial
Analyses—EQT Discounted Cash Flow Analyses" 

• Rice's GP/IDR interests: a discounted cash flow analysis of such interests on a pro forma basis applying the selected ranges
of GP/IDR cash flow multiples and discount rates described above for Rice's GP/IDR interests under "—Rice Financial
Analyses—Rice Discounted Cash Flow Analyses"

        The analyses described above indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for the pro forma
combined company both before and after taking into account the net present value of the Expected Development and Cost Savings
(applying a selected discount rate of 7.6% and a capitalization multiple of 8.0x and assuming tax-affected economic development
synergies and corporate general and administrative benefits at a tax rate of 35.0%) under a "low potential operational synergies" scenario
reflecting 50% of the anticipated development synergies reflected in the Expected Development and Cost Savings and a "high potential

Cost Savings, in each case reflecting 100% of the anticipated corporate general and administrative benefits reflected in the Expected
Development and Cost Savings:

• consolidated discounted cash flow analysis: $55.10 to $74.65 (no potential benefits), $60.40 to $79.95 (low potential
operational synergies) and $63.40 to $82.95 (high potential operational synergies) 

• sum-of-the-parts discounted cash flow analysis: $83.75 to $105.30 (no potential benefits), $89.10 to $110.60 (low potential
operational synergies) and $92.10 to $113.60 (high potential operational synergies)

        Citi observed that, based on the analyses described above, the mergers could result in potential value uplift for EQT (i) before taking
into account the Expected Development and Cost Savings of approximately 28% to 29.3% in the case of the pro forma combined company
on a consolidated basis and approximately 15.5% to 17.5% in the case of the pro forma combined company on a sum-of-the-parts basis
and (ii) after taking into account the net present value of such Expected Development and Cost Savings as described above of
approximately 38.4% to 47.3% in the case of the pro forma combined company on a consolidated basis and approximately 21.3% to
29.3% in the case of the pro forma combined company on a sum-of-the-parts basis. Actual results achieved by EQT, Rice and the pro
forma combined company may vary from forecasted results and such variations may be material.

Certain Additional Information

        Citi also observed certain additional factors that were not considered part of Citi's financial analyses with respect to its opinion but
were referenced for informational purposes, including the following:

        Rice Selected Public Companies Analysis (Based on Wall Street Research Analysts' Estimates).    Citi reviewed certain financial and
stock market information relating to Rice and the Rice selected companies. Citi reviewed, among other information, enterprise values
(calculated as described above for Rice on a consolidated basis under "—Rice Financial Analyses—Rice Selected Public Companies
Analyses") as a multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated upstream and retained midstream EBITDA plus
distributions from controlled MLPs (as applicable) and closing stock prices on June 16, 2017 as a multiple of calendar year 2017 and
calendar year 2018 estimated cash flow per share. Financial data of the Rice selected companies were based on publicly available Wall
Street research analysts' estimates, public filings and other publicly available information. Financial data of Rice was based on publicly
available Wall Street research analysts' estimates and public filings.

        The overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples and calendar year 2017 and calendar
year 2018 estimated cash flow per share multiples observed for the Rice selected companies were as described above under "—Rice
Financial Analyses—Rice Selected Public Companies Analyses." Citi noted that the calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated
EBITDA multiples for Rice were 6.1x and 4.9x, respectively, and the calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated cash flow per
share multiples for Rice were 5.4x and 4.5x, respectively. Citi then applied selected ranges of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018
estimated EBITDA multiples derived from the Rice selected companies of 6.1x to 8.8x and 4.9x to 7.1x, respectively, to corresponding
data of Rice and selected ranges of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated cash flow per share multiples derived from the
Rice selected companies of 5.4x to 9.5x and 4.5x to 6.0x, respectively, to corresponding data of Rice. This analysis indicated a selected
average approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Rice of $19.55 to $30.75.

companies. Citi reviewed, among other information, enterprise values (calculated as described above for Rice on a consolidated basis
under "—Rice Financial Analyses—Rice Selected Public Companies Analyses") as a multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year
2018 estimated upstream and retained midstream EBITDA plus distributions from controlled MLPs (as applicable) and closing stock
prices on June 16, 2017 as a multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated cash flow per share. Financial data of the
EQT selected companies were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates, public filings and other publicly
available information. Financial data of EQT was based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates and public filings.

        The overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated EBITDA multiples and calendar year 2017 and calendar
year 2018 estimated cash flow per share multiples observed for the EQT selected companies were as described above under "—EQT
Financial Analyses—EQT Selected Public Companies Analyses." Citi noted that the calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated
EBITDA multiples for EQT were 8.0x and 6.5x, respectively, and the calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated cash flow per
share multiples for EQT were 8.9x and 7.3x, respectively. Citi then applied selected ranges of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018
estimated EBITDA multiples derived from the EQT selected companies of 7.2x to 8.8x and 5.8x to 7.0x, respectively, to corresponding
data of EQT and selected ranges of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated cash flow per share multiples derived from the
EQT selected companies of 5.2x to 8.9x and 4.1x to 7.3x, respectively, to corresponding data of EQT. This analysis indicated a selected
average approximate implied per share equity value reference range for EQT of $42.60 to $62.00.

        Other.    Citi also observed the following:

• historical trading prices of Rice common stock during the 52-week period ended June 16, 2017, which indicated low to
high closing prices for Rice common stock during such period of approximately $18.30 to $29.36 per share; 

• historical trading prices of EQT common stock during the 52-week period ended June 16, 2017, which indicated low to
high closing prices for EQT common stock during such period of approximately $52.65 to $80.60 per share; 

• undiscounted publicly available Wall Street research analysts' price targets for Rice common stock, which indicated
standalone price targets for Rice common stock of $24.00 to $40.00 per share (with a median of $28.00 per share); 

• undiscounted publicly available Wall Street research analysts' price targets for EQT common stock, which indicated
standalone price targets for EQT common stock of $64.00 to $91.00 per share (with a median of $80.00 per share); and 

• the illustrative pro forma financial impact of the transaction on EQT's estimated cash flow per share for the calendar years
ending December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 based on the EQT forecasts and the adjusted Rice forecasts, among
other things, after taking into account the Expected Synergies, which indicated that the mergers could be accretive to EQT's
estimated cash flow per share for the calendar years ending December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 by approximately
19.7% and 32.3%, respectively. Actual results achieved by EQT, Rice and the pro forma combined company may vary
from forecasted results and variations may be material.

Miscellaneous

        EQT has agreed to pay Citi for its services in connection with the proposed merger an aggregate fee of $15 million, of which a
portion was payable upon delivery of Citi's opinion and $13 million is payable contingent upon consummation of the mergers. In addition,
EQT agreed to reimburse Citi for certain expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, and to indemnify Citi and certain

related parties against liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities laws, arising from Citi's engagement.

        As the EQT board was aware, at EQT's request, Citi and certain of its affiliates expect to participate in a bridge facility and related
financings in connection with the mergers, for which services Citi and such affiliates have received and will receive compensation,
including acting as lead arranger for, and as a lender under, such financings. EQT currently expects that Citi's aggregate fees in connection
with such financings will range from approximately $8.5 million to $10.5 million based on, among other things, the amount and type of
debt securities sold by EQT in connection with the mergers. As the EQT board also was aware, Citi and its affiliates in the past have
provided, currently are providing and in the future may provide investment banking, commercial banking and other similar financial
services to EQT and certain of its affiliates unrelated to the proposed mergers and related transactions, for which services Citi and its
affiliates received and expect to receive compensation, including, during the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, having acted
or acting as (i) co-syndication agent, joint lead arranger and bookrunner for, and as a lender under, certain credit facilities of EQT and an
affiliate of EQT and (ii) joint bookrunning manager and/or as an underwriter or sales agent for equity offerings of certain affiliates of EQT,
for which services described in clauses (i) and (ii) above Citi and its affiliates received during such two-year period aggregate fees of
approximately $2 million from EQT. As the EQT board further was aware, Citi and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are
providing and in the future may provide investment banking, commercial banking and other similar financial services to Rice and certain
of its affiliates and EIG Global Energy Partners, LLC ("EIG") and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies, for which services Citi
and its affiliates received and expect to receive compensation, including, during the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, having
acted or acting as (i) with respect to Rice and certain of its affiliates, co-documentation agent for, and/or as a lender under, certain credit
facilities of Rice and certain of its affiliates and (ii) with respect to EIG and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies, a lender under
certain credit facilities of certain portfolio companies of EIG, for which services described in clause (i) above Citi and its affiliates
received during such two-year period aggregate fees of approximately $3 million from Rice and for which services described in clause (ii)
above Citi and its affiliates did not receive fees from EIG during such two-year period. In the ordinary course of business, Citi and its
affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of EQT, Rice, EIG and their respective affiliates (or portfolio companies, as applicable)
for its own account or for the account of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In
addition, Citi and its affiliates (including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain relationships with EQT, Rice, EIG and their
respective affiliates (or portfolio companies, as applicable).

        EQT selected Citi to act as financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger based on Citi's reputation, experience and
familiarity with EQT, Rice and their respective businesses. Citi is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that regularly
engages in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings,
competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other
purposes.

Opinion of Rice's Financial Advisor 

        Rice engaged Barclays to act as its financial advisor with respect to the merger. On June 18, 2017, Barclays rendered its oral opinion
(which opinion was subsequently confirmed in writing) to the Rice board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the
qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the merger consideration to be offered to Rice stockholders (other than
holders of excluded shares) is fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.

        The full text of Barclays' written opinion, dated as of June 19, 2017, is attached as Annex D to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Barclays' written opinion sets forth, among other things, the

assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering
its opinion. You are encouraged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety. The following is a summary of Barclays' opinion and
the methodology that Barclays used to render its opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
the opinion.

        Barclays' opinion, the issuance of which was approved by Barclays' Fairness Opinion Committee, is addressed to the Rice board,
addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Rice stockholders (other than holders of excluded shares) of the merger
consideration to be offered to such stockholders and does not constitute a recommendation to any Rice stockholder as to how such
stockholder should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter. The terms of the merger were determined through arm's-length
negotiations between Rice and EQT and were unanimously approved by the Rice board. Barclays did not recommend any specific form of
consideration to Rice or that any specific form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. Barclays was
not requested to opine as to, and its opinion does not in any manner address, Rice's underlying business decision to proceed with or effect
the merger or the likelihood of consummation of the merger. In addition, Barclays expressed no opinion on, and its opinion does not in any
manner address, the fairness of the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any party to the
merger or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be offered to Rice stockholders in connection with the merger.
Barclays' opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which
Rice might engage. No limitations were imposed by the Rice board upon Barclays with respect to the investigations made or procedures
followed by it in rendering its opinion.

        In arriving at its opinion, Barclays, among other things, reviewed and analyzed:

• the merger agreement, including all ancillary documents thereto, and the specific terms of the merger; 

• publicly available information concerning Rice and EQT that Barclays believed to be relevant to its analysis, including,
without limitation, each of Rice's and EQT's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016
and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017; 

• publicly available information concerning RMP, EQM and EQGP that Barclays believed to be relevant to its analysis,
including, without limitation, each of RMP's, EQM's and EQGP's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2016 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017; 

• certain financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Rice furnished to
Barclays by Rice, including financial projections of Rice prepared by Rice's management (the "Rice Management
Projections"); 

• certain financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of EQT furnished to
Barclays by EQT, including financial projections of EQT prepared by EQT's management (the "EQT Management
Projections"); 

• estimates of certain oil and gas reserves and resources provided by Rice (the "Rice Resources") as prepared by Rice's
management (the "Rice Resources Report"); 

• estimates of certain oil and gas reserves and resources provided by EQT (the "EQT Resources") as prepared by EQT's
management (the "EQT Resources Report"); 

• a trading history of each of Rice common stock and EQT common stock from January 23, 2014 to June 16, 2017 and a
comparison of that trading history with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant;

• a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition of Rice and EQT with each other and with
those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant; 

• a comparison of the financial terms of the merger with the financial terms of certain other transactions that Barclays
deemed relevant; 

• the pro forma impact of the merger on the future financial performance of the combined company, including the amounts
and timing of the Expected Synergies, upon which management of Rice authorized Barclays to rely in connection with its
fairness opinion and related financial analyses, and other strategic benefits expected by the managements of each of Rice
and EQT to result from a combination of the businesses; 

• published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the future financial performance and price targets of
Rice and EQT; 

• the relative contributions of Rice and EQT to the anticipated future financial and operating performance of the combined
company on a pro forma basis; and 

• commodity price assumptions and the outlook for future commodity prices published by independent information service
providers.

        In addition, Barclays had discussions with the management of both Rice and EQT concerning its business, operations, assets,
liabilities, financial condition and prospects and undertook such other studies, analyses and investigations as Barclays deemed appropriate.

        In arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information
used by Barclays without any independent verification of such information (and did not assume responsibility or liability for any
independent verification of such information) and further relied upon the assurances of management of Rice that they were not aware of
any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Rice Management Projections,
upon the advice and at the direction of Rice, Barclays assumed that such projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Rice as to the future financial performance of Rice and that Rice
would perform substantially in accordance with such projections. With respect to the Rice Resources Report, Barclays discussed this
resources database with the management of Rice and upon the advice and at the direction of Rice, Barclays assumed that the Rice
Resources Report is a reasonable basis on which to evaluate the Rice Resources. With respect to the EQT Management Projections, upon
the advice and at the direction of Rice, Barclays assumed that such projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of EQT as to the future financial performance of EQT and that EQT would
perform substantially in accordance with such projections. With respect to the EQT Resources Report, Barclays discussed this resources
database with the management of Rice and upon the advice and at the direction of Rice, Barclays assumed that the EQT Resources Report
is a reasonable basis on which to evaluate the EQT Resources. Furthermore, upon the advice and at the direction of Rice, Barclays
assumed that the amounts and timing of the Expected Synergies are reasonable and that the Expected Synergies will be realized in
accordance with such estimates. Barclays assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to any such projections or estimates or
the assumptions on which they were based. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties and
facilities of Rice and did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of Rice. Barclays' opinion necessarily
was based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of June 19, 2017. Barclays assumed
no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on events or circumstances that may have occurred or that may occur after
June 19, 2017.

Table of Contents

        In connection with rendering its opinion, Barclays performed certain financial, comparative and other analyses as summarized below.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not ascribe a specific range of values to the shares of Rice common stock but rather made its
determination as to fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Rice common stock (other than holders of excluded shares) of the
merger consideration to be offered to such stockholders in connection with the merger on the basis of various financial and comparative
analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant methods of financial and comparative analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a
fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description.

        In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor considered by it but rather
made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor relative to all other analyses and factors
performed and considered by it and in the context of the circumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, Barclays believes that its
analyses must be considered as a whole, as considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and
factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Barclays in preparing its opinion to the Rice board. Certain
financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses
used by Barclays, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses. In performing its analyses, Barclays made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters as more fully described above, many of which are beyond the
control of Rice or any other parties to the merger. None of Rice, EQT, Merger Sub, Barclays or any other person assumes responsibility if
future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of
actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In
addition, analyses relating to the value of the businesses do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the businesses may
actually be sold.

Summary of Analyses

        The following is a summary of the principal financial analyses performed by Barclays with respect to Rice and EQT in preparing
Barclays' opinion:

• discounted cash flow analysis; 

• net asset valuation analysis; 

• comparable company analysis; and 

• comparable transaction analysis

        Each of these methodologies was used to generate reference enterprise and equity value ranges, as applicable, for each of Rice and
EQT. The enterprise value ranges for each company were adjusted for appropriate on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets and
liabilities to arrive at implied equity value ranges (in aggregate dollars) for each company, including, as applicable without limitation, the
after-tax estimated value impact of each company's current commodity hedging portfolio; net debt; and future estimated general and
administrative expenses. The implied equity value ranges for each of Rice and EQT were then divided by diluted shares outstanding,
consisting of primary shares and incorporating the dilutive effect of outstanding options or other dilutive securities, as appropriate, in order
to derive implied equity value ranges per share for each company. The Rice equity award conversions are accounted for in the fully diluted
share count and did not have a material impact on

the analysis undertaken by Barclays. For the corporate discounted cash flow analysis, the net asset valuation analysis, the comparable
company analysis, and the comparable transaction analysis, the implied equity value range per share of Rice common stock and per share
of EQT common stock were used to derive implied merger consideration ranges which were then compared to the merger consideration.

        In addition to analyzing the value of Rice and EQT common stock and the implied merger consideration, Barclays also analyzed and
reviewed: (i) the relative financial and operating contribution of Rice and EQT to the combined company on a pro forma basis; (ii) certain
publicly available information related to selected corporate transactions to calculate the amount of the premiums paid by the acquirers to
the acquired company's stockholders; (iii) the pro forma impact to the combined company of the merger on projected cash flow per share
and net asset value per share; (iv) the publicly available price targets of independent Wall Street research analysts; (v) the historical
exchange ratios of Rice and EQT common stock for the period from January 23, 2014 to June 16, 2017 and (vi) the daily historical closing
prices of Rice and EQT common stock for the period from January 23, 2014 to June 16, 2017.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        In order to estimate the present value of Rice and EQT common stock, Barclays performed a discounted cash flow analysis of each of
Rice and EQT. A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset by calculating
the "present value" of estimated future cash flows of the asset. "Present value" refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts
and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions
and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.

        To calculate the estimated enterprise value range of Rice using the discounted cash flow method, Barclays added (i) projected after-
tax unlevered free cash flows for the fiscal period from April 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 based on Rice's projections to (ii) the
"terminal value" of Rice, as of December 31, 2021, and discounted such amount to its present value using a range of selected after-tax
discount rates. Specifically, Barclays used an after-tax discount rate range of 10.0% to 14.0%. The after-tax discount rates were based on
Barclays' analysis of the weighted average cost of capital for Rice as well as the weighted average cost of capital for the Rice selected
comparable companies. The after-tax unlevered free cash flows were calculated by taking the tax-affected earnings before interest,
preferred cash dividend, tax expense, depreciation and amortization and subtracting capital expenditures and adjusting for changes in
working capital. The residual value of Rice at the end of the forecast period, or "terminal value," was estimated by selecting a range of
perpetuity growth rates from 3.0% to 4.0%, and applying such range to the adjusted terminal year, based on annualizing the fourth quarter
2021 earnings before interest, tax expense, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), after-tax free cash flow.

        To calculate the estimated enterprise value range of EQT using the discounted cash flow method, Barclays added (i) projected after-
tax unlevered free cash flows for the fiscal period from April 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 based on EQT's projections to (ii) the
"terminal value" of EQT, as of December 31, 2021, and discounted such amount to its present value using a range of selected after-tax
discount rates. Specifically, Barclays used an after-tax discount rate range of 7.0% to 8.5%. The after-tax discount rates were based on
Barclays' analysis of the weighted average cost of capital for EQT as well as the weighted average cost of capital for the EQT selected
comparable companies. The after-tax unlevered free cash flows were calculated by taking the tax-affected earnings before interest, tax
expense, depreciation and amortization and subtracting capital expenditures. The residual value of EQT at the end of the forecast period,
or "terminal value," was estimated by selecting a range of perpetuity growth rates from 5.25% to 5.75%, and applying such range to the
adjusted terminal year,

Table of Contents

based on the implied growth rate for the EQT management projections period from April 1, 2017 to 2021 EBITDA, after-tax free cash
flow.

        The discounted cash flow analysis yielded valuations for Rice and EQT that implied a merger consideration range of 0.1889 to 0.7047
of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock. Barclays noted that the merger consideration of 0.4602 of a share
of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock falls within the merger consideration range as calculated by Barclays'
discounted cash flow analysis for Rice and EQT.

Net Asset Valuation Analysis

        Barclays estimated the present value of the future after-tax cash flows expected to be generated from the Rice Resources Report and
the EQT Resources Report based on reserve, production and capital and operating cost estimates provided by Rice and EQT, respectively.
The present value of the future after-tax cash flows was determined using a range of discount rates and risking factors and assuming a tax
rate of 35.0%. Barclays then adjusted the present values of the cash flows by adding or subtracting as applicable (i) the present value of
after-tax general and administrative costs for both Rice and EQT; (ii) the present value of hedges for each of Rice and EQT; (iii) the equity
value based on the present value of distributable cash flow of RMP and EQM limited partner units owned by Rice and EQT, respectively;
(iv) the equity value based on the present value of incentive distribution rights cash flows to RMP's general partner ("RMP GP") and
EQGP owned by Rice and EQT, respectively; (v) the present value of unlevered free cash flows of the retained midstream assets of Rice;
(vi) the value impact after-tax of EQT's retained midstream assets based on an estimate provide by EQT management; (vii) the value of
Rice's divestiture of Barnett assets based on an estimate provided by Rice management; (viii) the present value of Rice capital
expenditures not included in the Rice Resources Report; and (ix) the value impact of the change of control payment associated with EIG's
ownership in Rice.

        Certain of the oil and natural gas price scenarios employed by Barclays were based on New York Mercantile exchange ("NYMEX"),
price forecasts (Henry Hub, Louisiana delivery for natural gas and West Texas Intermediate, Cushing Oklahoma delivery for oil), to which
adjustments were made by Barclays to reflect location and quality differentials. NYMEX gas price quotations stated in heating value
equivalents per million British Thermal Units ("Mmbtu"), were adjusted by Barclays to reflect the value per thousand cubic feet, or Mcf,
of gas. NYMEX oil price quotations are stated in dollars per barrel ("Bbl"), of crude oil.

        The following table summarizes the oil and natural gas price scenarios Barclays employed to estimate the future after-tax cash flows
for each of the reserve and resource categories that Barclays considered for Rice and EQT. Case I reflects an approximation of the
NYMEX strip as of the close of business on May 11, 2017. Case II reflects a low commodity price scenario. Case III reflects a high
commodity price scenario.

        Barclays calculated the estimated equity values for each of Rice and EQT's midstream assets associated with the net asset valuation
cases, under two midstream scenarios, midstream case 1 and midstream case 2 where midstream case 1 was associated with Case I Strip
and Case III, and midstream case 2 was associated with Case II. To calculate the estimated equity value range of Rice's interest in RMP,
for each of the midstream case 1 and midstream case 2 scenarios, Barclays added (i) projected distributable cash flow per limited partner
unit for the fiscal period from April 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 based on Rice's projections, for each of the midstream case 1 and
midstream case 2 scenarios, to (ii) the "terminal value" of RMP units, as of December 31, 2021, and discounted such amount to its present
value using a range of selected after-tax discount rates. Specifically, Barclays used a discount rate range of 17.5% to 19.5% for midstream
case 1 and 16.0% to 18.0% for midstream case 2. The discount rates were based on Barclays' analysis of the weighted average cost of
equity for RMP as well as the weighted average cost of equity for the RMP selected comparable companies. The residual value of RMP at
the end of the forecast period, or "terminal value," was estimated by selecting a range of terminal distributable cash flow yields, from
5.00% to 9.00% in midstream case 1 and 6.50% to 10.50% in midstream case 2, and applying such ranges to the terminal year
distributable cash flow per limited partner unit, based on annualizing the fourth quarter 2021 distributable cash flow per limited partner
unit. Barclays then calculated the total equity value attributable to Rice's interest in RMP by multiplying the implied RMP unit price by the
number of Rice owned units. To calculate the estimated equity value range of EQT's interest in EQM, for each of the midstream case 1 and
midstream case 2 scenarios, Barclays added (i) projected distributable cash flow per limited partner unit for the fiscal period from April 1,
2017 through December 31, 2021 based on EQT's projections to (ii) the "terminal value" of EQM units, as of December 31, 2021, and
discounted such amount to its present value using a range of selected after-tax discount rates. Specifically, Barclays used a discount rate
range of 17.5% to 19.5% for midstream case 1 and 16.0% to 18.0% for midstream case 2. The discount rates were based on Barclays'
analysis of the weighted average cost of equity for EQM as well as the weighted average cost of equity for the EQM selected comparable
companies. The residual value of EQM at the end of the forecast period, or "terminal value," was estimated by selecting a range of
terminal distributable cash flow yields, from 6.50% to 8.50% in midstream case 1 and 8.00% to 10.00% in midstream case 2, and applying
such ranges to the terminal year distributable cash flow per limited partner unit, based on holding constant the 2021 distributable cash flow
per limited partner unit. Barclays then calculated the total equity value attributable to EQT's interest in EQM by multiplying the implied
EQM unit price by the number of EQGP owned units by EQT's interest in EQGP. To calculate the estimated equity value range of
RMP GP, for each of the midstream case 1 and midstream case 2 scenarios, Barclays added (i) projected earned distributions for the fiscal
period from April 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 based on Rice's projections, for each the midstream case 1 and midstream case 2
scenarios, to (ii) the "terminal value" of RMP GP, as of December 31, 2021, and discounted such amount to its present value using a range
of selected discount rates. Specifically, Barclays used a discount rate range of 23.0% to 27.0% for midstream case 1 and 15.0% to 25.0%
for midstream case 2. The discount rates were based on Barclays' analysis of average cost of equity for RMP GP as well as the cost of
equity for the RMP GP selected comparable companies. The residual value of RMP GP at the end of the forecast period, or "terminal
value," was estimated by selecting a range of terminal distribution multiples, from 25.0x to 35.0x in midstream case 1 and 15.0x to 25.0x
in midstream case 2, and applying such ranges to the terminal year earned distributions, based on annualizing the fourth quarter 2021
earned distributions. To calculate the estimated equity value range of the EQM IDRs held by EQGP,

for each of the midstream case 1 and midstream case 2 scenarios, Barclays added (i) projected earned distributions for the fiscal period
from April 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 based on EQT's projections, for each the midstream case 1 and midstream case 2
scenarios, to (ii) the "terminal value" of the EQM IDRs held by EQGP, as of December 31, 2021, and discounted such amount to its
present value using a range of selected discount rates. Specifically, Barclays used a discount rate range of 15.0% to 25.0% for midstream
case 1 and 13.5% to 23.5% for midstream case 2. The discount rates were based on Barclays' analysis of average cost of equity for EQGP
as well as the cost of equity for the EQGP selected comparable companies. The residual value of the EQM IDRs held by EQGP at the end
of the forecast period, or "terminal value," was estimated by selecting a range of terminal distribution multiples, from 20.0x to 30.0x in
midstream case 1 and 12.5x to 22.5x in midstream case 2, and applying such ranges to the terminal year earned distributions, based on
holding constant the 2021 earned distributions. Barclays then calculated the total equity value attributable to EQT's interest in EQGP by
multiplying the implied EQGP equity value by EQT's interest in EQGP. To calculate the estimated equity value range of Rice retained
midstream assets, for each of the midstream case 1 and midstream case 2 scenarios, Barclays evaluated the projected after-tax free cash
flow for the fiscal period from April 1, 2017 through December 31, 2021 based on Rice's projections and discounted such amount to its
present value using a range of selected discount rates. Specifically, Barclays used a discount rate range of 10.0% to 20.0%. The discount
rates were based on Barclays' analysis of the average cost of capital for the Rice retained midstream assets as well as the cost of capital for
the Rice retained midstream selected comparable companies. The present value of the midstream assets was then adjusted by subtracting
debt, preferred equity, and adding cash to calculate the equity value for the Rice retained midstream assets. With respect the EQT retained
midstream assets, the value associated with midstream case 1 and midstream case 2 was provided by EQT management in the EQT
projections.

        These net asset valuation analyses yielded valuations for Rice and EQT that implied a merger consideration range of 0.3449 to 0.6055
of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock for Case I, a merger consideration range of 0.4048 to 0.8473 of a
share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock for Case II, a merger consideration range of 0.2928 to 0.4862 of a share
of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock for Case III, in each case as compared to the merger consideration of 0.4602
of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock. Barclays noted that the merger consideration was within the range
of the merger consideration ranges under each of the three price scenarios as calculated by Barclays' net asset valuation analyses for Rice
and EQT.

        Barclays selected the comparable companies listed above because their businesses and operating profiles are reasonably similar to
that of Rice or EQT, as applicable. However, because no selected comparable company is exactly the same as Rice or EQT, Barclays
believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected comparable company
analysis. Accordingly, Barclays also made qualitative judgments concerning differences between the business, financial and operating
characteristics and prospects of each of Rice and EQT and the selected comparable companies that could affect the public trading values of
each of Rice and EQT, their E&P businesses and their midstream businesses in order to provide a context in which to consider the results
of the quantitative analysis. These qualitative judgments related primarily to the differing sizes, growth prospects, profitability levels and
degree of operational risk between Rice and EQT and the companies included in the selected company analysis.

        Based upon these judgments, Barclays selected comparable company analysis yielded a merger consideration range of 0.2590 to
0.8345 of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock. Barclays noted that the merger consideration of 0.4602 of a
share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock falls within the merger consideration ranges as calculated by Barclays'
selected comparable company analysis.

Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis

        Barclays reviewed and compared the purchase prices and financial multiples paid in selected other transactions in the oil and gas
industry that Barclays, based on its experience with merger and acquisition transactions, deemed relevant. Barclays chose such
transactions based on, among other things, the similarity of the applicable target companies in the transactions to each of Rice's and EQT's
E&P business and midstream business with respect to the size, focus, commodity mix, reserve profile, margins and other characteristics of
their businesses.

        The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected precedent transactions analyzed were diverse and there are
inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of each of Rice's and EQT's E&P business and
midstream business and the companies and assets included in the selected precedent transaction analysis. Accordingly, Barclays believed
that a purely quantitative selected precedent transaction analysis would not be particularly meaningful in the context of considering the
merger. Barclays therefore made qualitative judgments concerning differences between the characteristics of the selected precedent
transactions and the merger which would affect the acquisition values of the selected target companies. The criteria used in selecting, from
the IHS Herold M&A database, the selected precedent transactions analyzed for the E&P business included all transactions: (a) (i) with
target corporations that are public and private; (ii) announced since January 1, 2005 with upstream values greater than $500 million; and
(iii) where the target's assets are primarily onshore the continental United States; and (b) (i) with target assets in the Marcellus or Utica;
and (ii) announced since January 1, 2014 with values greater than $50 million. The criteria used in selecting the midstream business
precedent transactions, included selected transactions: (a) (i) with target companies or businesses that are public and private;
(ii) announced since January 1, 2005 with transaction values greater than $200 million; and (iii) having expected high growth in EBITDA;
(b) (i) with target MLPs that are public; and (ii) announced since January 1, 1997 with transaction values greater than $1.0 billion; and (c)
(i) with targets that are public and private midstream general partnerships; and (ii) announced since January 1, 2010 with transaction
values greater than $50 million.

Midstream General Partnership

        As part of its selected precedent transaction analysis, Barclays calculated and analyzed the ratio of enterprise value to latest daily
production and proved reserves for the Rice and EQT E&P businesses. With respect to the Rice and EQT midstream businesses, Barclays
calculated and analyzed the ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA on a last twelve months ("LTM") basis as of March 31, 2017, derived
from the Rice and EQT projections, as applicable; and the ratio of enterprise value to distributions for the next twelve months as of
June 30, 2018 derived from the Rice and EQT projections, as applicable. The implied equity value range of each company was obtained by
adjusting, as applicable, the calculated enterprise value by its short and long-term debt and its cash and cash equivalents. All of

these calculations were performed and based on publicly available financial data including company filings. The results of the selected
precedent transaction analysis are summarized below:

 

 

 

 

        Based on Barclays' judgments as described above, Barclays' selected precedent transaction analysis yielded an implied merger
consideration range of 0.1975 to 0.5914 of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock. Barclays noted that the
merger consideration of 0.4602 of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice common stock falls within the implied merger
consideration range as calculated by Barclays' selected precedent transaction analysis.

Relative Contribution Analysis

        Barclays reviewed and analyzed the relative equity contribution of Rice and EQT, respectively, to the combined company on a pro
forma basis based on selected asset metrics, including reserves, acreage, net asset value ("NAV") per share and cash flow from operations,
in comparison to the pro forma equity received by Rice stockholders in the combined company. The analysis excluded synergies. For the
selected asset metrics, the relative equity contribution was calculated by multiplying Rice's percent asset contribution by the market
enterprise value of the combined company (assuming no premium), based on prices as of June 16, 2017, and subtracting short and long-
term debt, preferred equity, non-controlling interest and adding cash and cash equivalents.

        Barclays reviewed and analyzed Rice and EQT's contribution of reserves of the combined company on a pro forma basis on a proved
("1P") basis. Rice contributed approximately 13.7% of the pro forma equity value based on 1P reserves. Barclays also reviewed and
analyzed Rice and EQT's contribution of acreage on the basis of net core acres, net undeveloped acres and net core acres plus
Pennsylvania Utica and Upper Devonian acres. Rice contributed approximately 32.7%, 38.7% and 26.1% of the pro forma equity value
based on net core acres, net undeveloped acres and net core acres plus Pennsylvania Utica and Upper Devonian acres, respectively.
Barclays also reviewed and analyzed Rice and EQT's contribution to NAV per share based on Wall Street research consensus NAV and
NAV per share based on Barclays net asset value at strip price scenario. Rice contributed approximately 32.5% and 39.4% of the pro forma
equity value based on Wall Street research consensus NAV per share and NAV per share based on Barclays net asset value at strip price
scenario, respectively. Barclays also reviewed and analyzed Rice and EQT cash flow from operations based on estimates provided by
management and Wall Street research consensus estimates provided by FactSet for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Rice contributed 39.3%, 44.1%
and 49.7% of the pro forma equity value for 2017, 2018 and 2019,

respectively, based on estimates provided by management, and 37.9%, 42.0% and 41.0% of the pro forma equity value for 2017, 2018 and
2019, respectively, based on Wall Street research consensus estimates provided by FactSet. Barclays noted that the pro forma ownership
received by Rice stockholders in connection with the merger of 39.7%, assuming 100% stock merger consideration, was greater than the
equity contribution based on selected asset metrics, and 2017 cash flow from operations for both estimates provided by management and
Wall Street research consensus estimates provided by FactSet and less than the equity contribution for cash flow from operation in 2018
and 2019 for both estimates provided by management and Wall Street research consensus estimates provided by FactSet. Barclays notes
that the primary shortcoming of a contribution analysis is that it treats all cash flow, reserves, acreage and NAVs the same regardless of
capitalization, expected growth rates, upside potential, risk profile or credit profile.

Transaction Premium Analysis

        In order to assess the premium offered to Rice stockholders in connection with the merger relative to the premiums offered to
stockholders in other transactions, Barclays reviewed the premium paid in the oil and gas industry in all public transactions of E&P
companies domiciled in the U.S. with an enterprise value above $250 million from January 1, 2004 to June 16, 2017. For each transaction,
Barclays calculated the premium per share paid by the acquirer by comparing the announced transaction value per share to the target
company's (a) historical average share price during the following periods: (i) one trading day prior to announcement, (ii) five trading days
prior to announcement and (iii) 30 trading days prior to announcement, and (b) the 52-week high trading price prior to announcement. The
selected transactions and results of this transaction premium analysis are summarized below:

        The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the transactions analyzed in the transaction premium analysis were diverse
and there are inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of Rice and the companies included in the
transaction premium analysis. Accordingly, Barclays believed that a purely quantitative transaction premium analysis would not be
particularly meaningful in the context of considering the merger. Barclays therefore made qualitative judgments concerning the differences
between the characteristics of the

selected transactions and the merger which would affect the acquisition values of the target companies and Rice.

Pro Forma Merger Consequences Analysis

        Barclays reviewed and analyzed the pro forma impact of the merger, including the Expected Synergies, on projected cash flow per
share and NAV per share, respectively. With respect to cash flow per share for Rice and EQT, Barclays reviewed the pro forma impact of
these metrics for 2018, 2019 and 2020 using projections provided by management of each of Rice and EQT as well as the pro forma
impact on cash flow per share for Rice and EQT for 2018 and 2019 using Wall Street research estimates provided by FactSet, in each case,
incorporating the Expected Synergies. Barclays noted that pro forma cash flow per share would be accretive to Rice in 2018 (1.0%) and
dilutive to Rice for each of 2019 (–10.9%) and 2020 (–12.4%), respectively, based on projections provided by management, and accretive
to Rice in each of 2018 (5.5%) and 2019 (7.2%), respectively, based on Wall Street research estimates provided by FactSet. Barclays also
noted that pro forma cash flow per share would be accretive to EQT in each of 2018 (20.8%), 2019 (33.3%) and 2020 (33.0%),
respectively, based on projections provided by management, and accretive to EQT in each of 2018 (15.6%) and 2019 (13.0%),
respectively, based on Wall Street research estimates provided by FactSet. With respect to NAV per share for Rice and EQT, Barclays also
reviewed the pro forma impact of this metric using projections provided by management of each of Rice and EQT as well as Wall Street
research consensus NAV per share provided by FactSet, in each case, incorporating the Expected Synergies. Barclays also noted that pro
forma NAV per share would be accretive to both Rice (2.9%) and EQT (3.9%), respectively, based on projections provided by
management, and dilutive to EQT (–6.3%) and accretive to Rice (28.7%), based on Wall Street research consensus NAV per share
provided by FactSet.

Analysis of Equity Research Price Targets

        Barclays evaluated the publicly available price targets of Rice and EQT published by independent research analysts associated with
various Wall Street firms. The range of undiscounted analyst price targets for Rice commons stock was $22.00 to $40.00 per share as of
June 16, 2017, and the range of undiscounted analyst price targets for EQT common stock was $63.00 to $92.00 per share as of June 16,
2017. Barclays noted for illustrative purposes that the merger consideration of 0.4602 of a share of EQT for each share of Rice common
stock falls within the range implied by the equity research price targets of 0.2391 to 0.6349 shares of EQT common stock per share of Rice
common stock.

Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis

        To provide background information and perspective to the historical share prices of Rice and EQT common stock, Barclays reviewed
the daily historical closing prices of Rice common stock and EQT common stock over the period from January 23, 2014 to June 16, 2017.
In addition, Barclays reviewed the implied relative exchange ratio based on the share prices of Rice and EQT as of 5 and 30 days prior to
June 16, 2017; the 52-week high share price for Rice and EQT respectively; the average 5-day, 10-day, 30-day, 90-day and the period since
January 23, 2014; and the maximum exchange ratio during the period from January 23, 2014 to June 16, 2017 of share prices of Rice
common stock and EQT common stock, as of June 16, 2017. This analysis implied relative exchange ratios from 0.2800 to 0.3990 shares
of EQT common stock per share of Rice common stock.

Historical Share Price Analysis

        To illustrate the trend in the historical trading prices of Rice common stock, Barclays considered historical data with regard to the
trading prices of Rice common stock for the period from January 23,

General

        Barclays is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control
purposes, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. The Rice board selected Barclays because of its familiarity with Rice and its
qualifications, reputation and experience in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions
generally, as well as substantial experience in transactions comparable to the merger.

        Barclays is acting as financial advisor to Rice in connection with the merger. As compensation for its services in connection with the
merger, Rice paid Barclays a fee of $1,000,000 upon the delivery of Barclays' opinion. Additional compensation of approximately
$47 million will be payable on completion of the merger against which the amounts paid for the opinion will be credited. In addition, Rice
has agreed to reimburse Barclays for a portion of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the merger not to
exceed $150,000 and to indemnify Barclays for certain liabilities that may arise out of its engagement by Rice and the rendering of
Barclays' opinion. Barclays has performed various investment banking and financial services for Rice, EQT and certain of their affiliates
in the past, and is likely to perform such services in the future, and has received, and is likely to receive, customary fees for such services.
Specifically, in the past two years, Barclays has performed the following investment banking and financial services: (A) for Rice and its
affiliates, (i) in December 2016, acted as joint bookrunner and joint lead arranger on Rice's refinancing of its $1,450 million credit facility,
and as a lender under the credit facility, (ii) in October 2016, acted as joint bookrunner and joint lead arranger on RMP's refinancing of
RMP's $850 million credit facility, and as a lender under the credit facility, (iii) in September 2016, acted as placement agent on RMP's
$450 million private placement, (iv) in September 2016, acted as joint bookrunner on Rice's $1,200 million registered block trade, (v) in
February 2016, acted as sole financial advisor to Rice on the $500 million investment by EIG Global Energy Partners into Rice Midstream
Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Rice ("Rice Midstream Holdings"), and (vi) in November 2015, acted as placement agent on RMP's
$175 million private placement; and (B) for EQT and its affiliates, (i) in November 2015, acted as joint bookrunner on EQM's
$400 million registered block trade, (ii) in March 2015, acted as joint bookrunner on EQM's $697 million registered block trade, (iii) in
May 2015, acted as lead left bookrunner on EQGP's $621 million initial public offering, and (iv) acted as lender under EQT's credit
facility.

        Following the public announcement of the merger, EQT requested that Barclays participate, on the same terms as the other lenders
thereto, in (i) a $1,000 million increase to its revolving credit facility, and (ii) a $250 million increase to EQM's revolving credit facility
(collectively referred to in this paragraph as the "incremental revolver upsizes"). Barclays is a participant in both existing facilities and has
received customary commitment fees in connection with such facilities. After being informed of the invitation to participate in the
incremental revolver upsizes, Barclays advised Rice that Barclays did not intend to participate in the absence of the consent of Rice and
the Rice board. After consultation with outside counsel, Rice and the Rice board provided such consent, and Barclays participated in the
incremental revolver upsizes. Barclays is expected to earn customary commitment fees in connection with the incremental revolver
upsizes, which are estimated to be an amount equal to or less than $647,500. Barclays has not sought to provide, and Barclays will not
provide, "stapled" or acquisition financing in connection with the merger.

Table of Contents

        Barclays and its affiliates engage in a wide range of businesses from investment and commercial banking, lending, asset management
and other financial and non-financial services. In the ordinary course of its business, Barclays and affiliates may actively trade and effect
transactions in the equity, debt and/or other securities (and any derivatives thereof) and financial instruments (including loans and other
obligations) of Rice and EQT and their respective affiliates for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may
at any time hold long or short positions and investments in such securities and financial instruments.

Financing of the Transactions 

        Excluding any funds required to refinance and/or pay off any indebtedness of Rice and its subsidiaries on the closing date and cash
severance costs, EQT anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to finance the transactions and to pay transaction fees and
expenses will be approximately $1.8 billion. This amount is expected to be funded through a combination of available cash on hand,
borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility and the issuance and/or sale by EQT of senior unsecured notes.

        In connection with the transactions, EQT entered into a commitment letter dated June 19, 2017 (as amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified, the "commitment letter") with Citi, pursuant to which Citi and certain of its affiliates committed to provide a
$1.4 billion senior unsecured 364-day term loan bridge facility (the "Bridge Facility"). On July 14, 2017, EQT entered into joinder letters
to the commitment letter, pursuant to which 16 additional banks (together with Citi, the "commitment parties") committed to finance a
portion of the Bridge Facility.

        On October 4, 2017, EQT terminated the Bridge Facility and closed an offering of $3.0 billion of its fixed and floating rate senior
notes.

        The merger is not conditioned upon receipt by EQT of the proceeds of this or any other financing.

        In connection with the merger, EQT expects to repay and terminate the existing credit facilities of Rice and Rice Midstream Holdings
and to redeem, repurchase or otherwise retire Rice's existing senior notes.

Interests of Certain Rice Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the Rice board that the Rice stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement, Rice's
stockholders should be aware that aside from their interests as stockholders of Rice, Rice's directors and executive officers have interests
in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of other stockholders of Rice generally. The members of the Rice board
were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger,
and in recommending to the stockholders of Rice that the merger agreement be approved. See "—Background of the Merger" and "—
Recommendation of the Rice Board and Reasons for the Merger." Rice's stockholders should take these interests into account in deciding
whether to vote "FOR" the approval of the merger agreement. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are
quantified in the narrative and the tables below. For the purposes of the plans and agreements described below, to the extent applicable, the
completion of the merger will constitute a change of control, change in control or term of similar meaning.

Indemnification and Insurance

        The merger agreement provides that, for a period of six years from the effective time, EQT and the surviving corporation in the
merger shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless each present and former director, officer or employee of Rice or
any of its subsidiaries and each person who acts as a fiduciary under any Rice plan or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the

whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to, at or after the effective time and whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the effective time. For additional information see "The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance."

Treatment of Rice Equity Awards

        At the effective time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award or performance stock unit award in respect of Rice common stock
that is held by an employee or other service provider of Rice (including Rice directors) who will be continuing with EQT following the
effective time will be converted into a restricted stock unit award, with substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
the pre-conversion award, in respect of a number of shares of EQT common stock equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole
share) of (a) the number of shares of Rice common stock subject to the pre-conversion award multiplied by (b) the stock award exchange
ratio. Performance conditions that are applicable to any such Rice performance stock units will be deemed to have been met at the
maximum level specified in the award at the effective time, and the converted awards will be subject solely to time-based vesting.

        For Rice employees identified by EQT prior to the effective time as not continuing to be employed following the effective time, at the
effective time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award or performance stock unit award in respect of Rice common stock will vest and
be settled within seven business days following the closing date for the merger consideration with respect to each share of Rice common
stock subject to such awards. Performance conditions that are applicable to such Rice performance stock units will be deemed to have
been met at the maximum level specified in the award at the effective time.

Quantification of Equity Awards

Rice common stock subject to the restricted stock units and performance stock units held by such directors and executive officers.

Treatment of 2017 Bonus

        If the effective time occurs prior to the time that bonuses would be paid in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, then each executive officer (along with all other employees who participate in Rice's annual bonus program for 2017 as of
immediately prior to the effective time) shall receive a bonus payment equal to 200% of the executive officer's target bonus opportunity,
which will be paid no later than seven days following the closing date. As a condition to such payment, each executive officer shall
execute an agreement providing that (a) such bonus shall be in lieu of any other entitlement to a bonus in respect of 2017 (including the
right to a pro-rata bonus on termination under the employment agreements with each executive officer), and (b) such executive officer
shall repay the bonus if his or her employment is involuntarily terminated for "cause" (as defined below) or he or she voluntarily
terminates his or her employment without "good reason" (as defined in the executive officer's employment agreement) prior to the time
bonuses would have been paid in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice under Rice's annual bonus plan for 2017 (for
additional information regarding the employment agreements, see "—Termination Benefits—Employment Agreements," below). Rice's
directors do not participate in Rice's annual bonus program and receive no bonus payment under the merger agreement.

        For purposes of the 2017 bonus payment described above, "cause" means (a) the executive officer's conviction of a felony, a crime of
moral turpitude or fraud or the commission of fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement in connection with the performance of his or her
duties to EQT, Rice or their respective affiliates; (b) the executive officer's willful and repeated failure to substantially

respective affiliates.

Quantification of Bonus Payments

        The following table sets forth, for each of Rice's executive officers, the dollar amount of the bonus payable under the merger
agreement, as described above, assuming a closing date prior to the time that bonuses would be paid in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.

Termination Benefits

        The following outlines the benefits to which Rice's executive officers are eligible to receive if they experience a qualifying
termination of employment in connection with the merger.

Employment Agreements

        Rice has entered into employment agreements with each of the executive officers. Although it has not yet been determined whether
the executive officers will continue employment with EQT or if they will incur a termination of employment in connection with the
merger, for purposes of quantifying the severance benefits that may become payable to each executive officer, the employment of each of
the executive officers will be assumed to be terminated without "cause" in connection with the merger, triggering certain compensation
and benefits to each of those executive officers pursuant to their employment agreements, described below. Under the terms of each
employment agreement, if an executive officer's employment is terminated without "cause" or the executive officer terminates
employment for "good reason," in each case within 12 months of a change in control, then such executive officer will be eligible to
receive:

• a lump sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of (i) the executive officer's base salary as of the date of such
termination and (ii) the executive officer's average annual bonus for the three calendar years preceding the date of
termination, which amount shall be paid on the date that is 60 days after the date of termination; 

• COBRA medical insurance coverage for up to 18 months, with Rice paying the premium cost in excess of that which
applies to active Rice senior executives; 

• a prorated annual bonus for the year in which a termination of employment occurs; and 

• full vesting of the executive officer's outstanding unvested awards under the Rice LTIP, with performance to be measured
based on actual performance at the end of the performance period as if the executive officer had remained employed.

        For purposes of the employment agreements, "cause" means a determination by the Rice board (or its delegate) that the executive
officer (a) has engaged in gross negligence, gross incompetence, or

misconduct in the performance of his or her duties with respect to Rice or any of its affiliates, (b) has failed without proper legal reason to
perform his or her duties and responsibilities to Rice or any of its affiliates, (c) has breached any material provision of the employment
agreement or any written agreement or corporate policy or code of conduct established by Rice or any of its affiliates, (d) has engaged in
conduct that is, or could reasonably expected to be, materially injurious to Rice or any of its affiliates, (e) has committed an act of theft,
fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or breach of a fiduciary duty to Rice or any of its affiliates, or (f) has been convicted of, pleaded
no contest to, or received adjudicated probation or deferred adjudication in connection with a crime involving fraud, dishonesty, or moral
turpitude or any felony (or a crime of similar import in a foreign jurisdiction).

        For purposes of the employment agreements, "good reason" means (a) a material diminution in the executive officer's base salary,
other than as a part of one or more decreases that (i) shall not exceed, in the aggregate, more than 10% of the executive officer's base
salary as in effect on the date immediately prior to such decrease, and (ii) are applied similarly to all of Rice's similarly situated
executives; (b) a material diminution in the executive officer's authority, duties, or responsibilities; or (c) the involuntary relocation of the
geographic location of the executive officer's principal place of employment by more than 75 miles from the location of his or her
principal place of employment as of the effective date of the employment agreement.

        In the event that the Rice board determines that payments to be made to an executive officer would constitute excess parachute
payments subject to excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code, then the amount of those payments must either be (i) reduced so that the
total compensation received by the executive officer in connection with the transaction is $1.00 less than the amount that would cause the
officer to incur such excise tax or (ii) paid in full, whichever results in the better net after tax position for the executive officer. This
potential reduction to the termination benefits could be significant. In no event is Rice required to provide tax gross-up payments to any
executive officer.

        Under the employment agreements, each executive officer is subject to restrictions on competition and soliciting Rice employees and
customers following the executive officer's termination of employment, as described in more detail in "—Impact of Other Agreements,"
below.

Impact of Other Agreements

        Although, as described above, the executive officers are eligible to receive a prorated bonus for the year of termination under their
employment agreements, if the closing date occurs prior to the time that bonuses would be paid in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, then, pursuant to the merger agreement, each executive officer would receive a bonus payment of 200% of
the executive officer's target bonus opportunity in lieu of such prorated bonus (for additional information on the 2017 bonus payout, see
"—Treatment of 2017 Bonus," above). As a result, the prorated bonus amounts are not included in "—Quantification of Termination
Payments," below.

        Also pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, any unvested restricted stock unit awards in respect of EQT common stock that
are granted in replacement of canceled Rice equity awards would be subject to accelerated vesting upon the holder's termination of
employment without cause, for good reason or due to death or disability prior to the final vesting date, subject to the holder's execution of
a release of claims in favor of EQT.

        In connection with the execution of the merger agreement and effective immediately following the closing of the merger, Rice entered
into an amendment to the employment agreements with each of the executive officers. The amendments amend terms of the executive
officers' existing obligations under their respective employment agreements to refrain from competing with the business of Rice. The
employment agreement amendments provide, among other terms, that the executive officers may not engage in certain competitive
activities with Rice during the time of their employment and for a

period of three years after the end of such employment in any location within the Appalachian Basin, as defined by the United States
Energy Information Administration. In addition, in connection with the execution of the merger agreement and effective immediately
following the closing of the merger, Rice entered into a confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-competition agreement with Daniel Rice
III that imposes confidentiality and non-competition covenants on Mr. Rice III that are comparable to those applicable to the executive
officers under their amended employment agreements, with the non-competition period running for three years from the closing of the
merger.

Quantification of Termination Payments

        The amounts set forth below reflect the estimated value of compensation and benefits that the current Rice executive officers would
be eligible to receive upon a termination without cause or resignation for good reason in connection with the merger, assuming a closing
date of October 11, 2017.

also provide for the payment of a prorated portion of each executive officer's annual bonus, based on the date of
termination. Under the merger agreement, however, the prorated bonus would be foregone in lieu of a payment of
200% of the target bonus within seven days of the closing date, and as such is not included in this number. See "—

closing price of Rice common stock for the five trading days following the first public announcement of the merger.
For performance stock units, the number of Rice common shares subject to each award is determined assuming the
maximum level of performance specified in the award.

Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Rice's Named Executive Officers

        Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of compensation arrangements or understandings with Rice's named executive
officers that are based on or otherwise relate to the merger, whether present, deferred or contingent. The individuals disclosed within this
section are Rice's current principal executive officer, current principal financial officer, and three most highly compensated executive
officers other than the principal executive officer and principal financial officer for Rice's most recently completed fiscal year.

        The table set forth below details the amount of payments and benefits that each of Rice's named executive officers could potentially
receive in connection with the merger under the merger agreement, the Rice LTIP and the applicable employment agreements. These
payments consist of the payments described above and are not in addition to those described in previous sections. The amounts presented
in the table below do not necessarily represent what each named executive officer will actually receive, and are calculated based on
particular assumptions, as outlined below. These payments are specifically identified in this fashion to allow for a non-binding advisory
vote of Rice's stockholders regarding these payments and benefits.

        The amounts in the table below were calculated using the following assumptions: (i) the consummation of the merger occurs on
October 11, 2017, (ii) the value of accelerated equity awards is determined by multiplying the number of shares subject to each restricted
stock unit or performance stock unit by $24.76, the average closing price of the Rice common stock over the first five trading days
following the first public announcement of the merger, with the number of shares subject to each performance stock unit determined
assuming achievement of the maximum level of performance specified in the award, (iii) although it has not yet been determined whether
the named executive officers will continue employment with EQT or if they will incur a termination of employment in connection with the
merger, the employment of each of the named executive officers will be assumed to be terminated without cause immediately following
the completion of the merger, (iv) each named executive officer elects to receive continued COBRA coverage for 18 months following
termination, (v) there is no reduction to the payments received by each named executive officer to mitigate the potential effects of an
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, although such reduction is provided for in the employment agreements and could be
significant, and (vi) with respect to any agreements that require the named executive officer to execute a release agreement or to comply
with restrictive covenants, the named executive officer has properly executed that document or complied with all requirements necessary
in order to receive the benefits noted below. Some of the assumptions used in the table below are subject to change and, as a result, the
actual amounts to be received by any of the individuals below may differ from the amounts set forth below.

Board of Directors and Management of EQT Following Completion of the Merger 

        In the merger agreement, EQT has agreed, subject to the approval of the charter amendment proposal by EQT's shareholders, to
increase the size of the EQT board to thirteen members and cause Daniel J. Rice IV and Robert F. Vagt to become members of the EQT
board upon the effective time of the merger. If EQT's shareholders do not approve the charter amendment proposal at the EQT special
meeting, EQT has agreed to increase the size of the EQT board to twelve directors and appoint either Mr. Rice or Mr. Vagt, at Rice's
election, upon the effective time and to seek shareholder approval to increase the maximum size of the EQT board specified in the EQT
articles to thirteen directors at its next annual meeting of shareholders and appoint the Rice designee not appointed upon the effective time.

        Upon completion of the merger, the current directors and executive officers of EQT are expected to continue in their current
positions, other than as may be publicly announced by EQT in the normal course.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 

        The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers to U.S. holders (as defined
below) of Rice common stock that receive shares of EQT common stock and cash in exchange for their shares of Rice common stock
pursuant to the merger. This discussion is limited to U.S. holders (as defined below) who hold their Rice common stock as a "capital asset"
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion is based on current provisions of
the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial interpretations thereof and administrative rulings and published
positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), each as in effect as of the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change or
differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect, and any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions
set forth herein.

        This discussion is for general information only and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be
relevant to particular holders of Rice common stock in light of

trigger" payment and will be paid regardless of whether the named executive officer's employment terminates
in connection with the merger. All other cash payments are "double-trigger" payments and are only payable to
the named executive officer upon a termination of the named executive officer's employment. For additional
information regarding these payments, see "—Treatment of 2017 Bonus" and "—Termination Benefits,"
above.

(2) The value of the equity awards is determined by multiplying the number of shares of Rice common stock
subject to each named executive officer's restricted stock units and performance stock units by $24.76, which
is the average closing price of Rice common stock for the five trading days following the first public
announcement of the merger. For performance stock units, the number of Rice common shares subject to each
award is determined assuming the maximum level of performance specified in the award. This is assuming a
"double-trigger" scenario, where each named executive officer is terminated in connection with the merger.
There is no "single-trigger" vesting of outstanding Rice equity awards. For additional information regarding
the treatment of equity awards in connection with the merger, see "—Treatment of Rice Equity Awards" and
"—Employment Agreements," above.

of that which applies to active Rice senior executives. This coverage is only available in a "double-trigger"
scenario where the named executive officer is terminated in connection with the merger.

their particular facts and circumstances and does not apply to holders of Rice common stock that are subject to special rules under the U.S.
federal income tax laws (including, for example, banks or other financial institutions, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in
securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, entities or arrangements
treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other flow-through entities (and investors therein), subchapter S
corporations, retirement plans, individual retirement accounts or other tax-deferred accounts, real estate investment trusts, regulated
investment companies, holders liable for the alternative minimum tax, U.S. holders having a "functional currency" other than the U.S.
dollar, holders who hold shares of Rice common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction or other
integrated transaction, holders that actually or constructively hold (or that held, actually or constructively, at any time during the five year
period ending on the date of the disposition of such holder's Rice common stock pursuant to the merger) 5% or more of the Rice common
stock, holders who exercise appraisal rights, and holders who acquired their shares of Rice common stock through the exercise of an
employee stock option or otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan). This discussion does not address any
considerations under U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to the income tax, nor does it address any considerations under any
state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010. Furthermore, this discussion does not address any tax consequences to holders who are not U.S. holders.

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of shares of Rice common stock that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, is:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

• a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; 

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or 

• a trust (a) if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one
or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) that has a valid election in
effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of
Rice common stock, the tax treatment of a person treated as a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner,
the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partnership level. Such partnerships and persons that for U.S.
federal income tax purposes are treated as a partner in a partnership holding shares of Rice common stock should consult their tax advisors
regarding the tax consequences of the mergers to them.

        All holders of Rice common stock should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them of
the mergers, including the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. and other tax laws. Holders of Rice
common stock that are not U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possibility that, in the event the applicable
withholding agent is unable to determine whether any cash consideration paid in the merger should be treated as a dividend for
applicable U.S. federal income tax purposes, such withholding agent may withhold U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or
such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of cash consideration payable to such
non-U.S. holder in the merger, and such non-U.S. holders should consult

their own tax advisors as to the possible desirability and timing of selling any shares of EQT common stock or Rice common stock that
they own.

        EQT and Rice intend that the mergers, taken together, qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
It is a condition to each of EQT's and Rice's obligation to complete the mergers that it receive a written opinion from its counsel, Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Vinson & Elkins LLP, respectively, to the effect that the mergers, taken together, will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These opinions will be based on representations made by EQT and
Rice and on customary factual assumptions, as well as certain covenants and undertakings of EQT and Rice. If any of such
representations, assumptions, covenants or undertakings is or becomes incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate or is violated, the validity of the
opinions described above may be affected and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers could differ materially from those
described below. In addition, neither of the opinions described above will be binding on the IRS or any court. EQT and Rice have not
sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS regarding any matters relating to the mergers. There can be no assurance that the IRS will
not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth below. The following assumes the
receipt and accuracy of the above-described opinions.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers to U.S. Holders

        Subject to the limitations and qualifications described under "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" and herein, the legal
conclusions set forth in this discussion under "U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers to U.S. Holders" constitutes the
opinion of each of Vinson & Elkins, LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz. The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers
to U.S. holders of Rice common stock generally are as follows:

• a U.S. holder that receives shares of EQT common stock and cash (other than cash received in lieu of fractional shares of
EQT common stock) in exchange for shares of Rice common stock pursuant to the merger generally will recognize gain
(but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount by which the sum of the fair market value of the EQT
common stock and cash received by the U.S. holder exceeds such U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares of Rice
common stock surrendered and (ii) the amount of cash received by such U.S. holder (in each case excluding any cash
received in lieu of fractional shares in EQT common stock, which will be treated as discussed below); 

• the aggregate tax basis of the shares of EQT common stock received pursuant to the merger (including any fractional
shares of EQT common stock deemed received and redeemed for cash, as discussed below) will be the same as the
aggregate tax basis of the shares of Rice common stock surrendered in exchange therefor, (i) decreased by the amount of
cash received (excluding any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of EQT common stock), and (ii) increased by the
amount of gain recognized on the exchange (regardless of whether such gain is classified as capital gain or dividend
income, as discussed below, but excluding any gain recognized with respect to any fractional shares of EQT common stock
for which cash is received, as discussed below); and 

• the holding period of the EQT common stock received (including any fractional shares of EQT common stock deemed
received and redeemed for cash, as discussed below) will include the holding period of the Rice common stock for which it
is exchanged.

        If a U.S. holder of Rice common stock acquired different blocks of shares of Rice common stock at different times or at different
prices, any gain or loss will be determined separately with respect to each block of shares of Rice common stock and such U.S. holder's
basis and holding period in its shares of EQT common stock may be determined with reference to each block of shares of Rice common
stock. Any such holder should consult its tax advisors regarding the manner in which cash and

Table of Contents

shares of EQT common stock received in the merger should be allocated among different blocks of shares of Rice common stock and with
respect to identifying the bases and holding periods of the particular shares of EQT common stock received.

        Subject to the discussion below regarding potential dividend treatment, any gain recognized by a U.S. holder in connection with the
mergers generally will constitute capital gain and will constitute long-term capital gain if such U.S. holder has held its shares of Rice
common stock surrendered for more than one year as of the effective date of the merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate
holders, including individuals, are generally taxed at preferential rates. In some cases, if a holder actually or constructively owns EQT
common stock other than EQT common stock received pursuant to the merger, any gain recognized by such holder could be treated as
having the effect of a distribution of a dividend under the tests set forth in Section 302 of the Code, in which case such gain would be
treated as dividend income. Because the possibility of dividend treatment depends upon each holder's particular circumstances, including
the application of constructive ownership rules, holders of Rice common stock should consult their tax advisors regarding the application
of the foregoing rules to their particular circumstances.

        A U.S. holder of shares of Rice common stock that receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of EQT common stock will generally be
treated as having received the fractional share pursuant to the merger, and then as having sold such fractional share to EQT for cash. As a
result, such U.S. holder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the tax basis
allocated to such fractional share of EQT common stock. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the
effective date of the merger, the holding period for such fractional share (as described above) exceeds one year. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitation.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        Payments of cash to a U.S. holder of Rice common stock in connection with the merger generally will be subject to information
reporting and may, under certain circumstances, be subject to backup withholding, unless the U.S. holder provides proof of an applicable
exemption or furnishes its taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed
as a refund or credit against a U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that certain required information is timely
furnished to the IRS.

        The preceding discussion is intended only as a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers. It is not
a complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax effects that may be important to a particular holder. All holders of Rice common
stock should consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences of the mergers to them, including tax reporting
requirements, and the applicability and effect of any federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax laws.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger 

        EQT prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of
accounting with EQT being considered the acquirer of Rice for accounting purposes. This means that EQT will allocate the purchase price
to the fair value of Rice's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price (if any) being
recorded as goodwill. Under the acquisition method of accounting, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually.

Regulatory Approvals 

Antitrust Clearance

        The completion of the merger is subject to antitrust review in the United States. Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated
thereunder, the merger cannot be completed until the parties to the merger agreement have given notification and furnished information to
the FTC and the DOJ, and until the applicable waiting period has expired or has been terminated.

        On June 30, 2017, EQT and Rice each filed a premerger notification and report form under the HSR Act and on July 18, 2017, the
FTC granted early termination under the HSR Act.

        At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act,
the FTC or the DOJ, or any state, could take such action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest,
including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of EQT or Rice or their respective
subsidiaries. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

Securities and Exchange Commission

        In connection with the share issuance proposal, EQT must file a registration statement with the SEC under the Exchange Act that is
declared effective by the SEC.

Exchange of Shares 

        As soon as practicable after the effective time (but no later than the second business day after the closing date), an exchange agent
will mail to each holder of record of Rice common stock (whose shares were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration
pursuant to the merger agreement) a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Rice stock certificates and
book-entry shares representing Rice book-entry shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Upon receipt by the exchange agent of
(i) either Rice stock certificates or Rice book-entry shares and (ii) a signed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such shares will be entitled to receive the merger consideration in exchange therefor.

Treatment of Rice Long-Term Incentive Compensation 

        At the effective time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award or performance stock unit award in respect of Rice common stock
that is held by an employee or other service provider of Rice (including Rice directors) who will be continuing with EQT following the
effective time will be converted into a restricted stock unit award, with substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
the pre-conversion award, in respect of a number of shares of EQT common stock equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole
share) of (a) the number of shares of Rice common stock subject to the pre-conversion award multiplied by (b) the stock award exchange
ratio. Performance conditions that are applicable to any such Rice performance stock units will be deemed to have been met at the
maximum level specified in the award at the effective time, and the converted awards will be subject solely to time-based vesting.

        For Rice employees identified by EQT prior to the effective time as not continuing to be employed following the effective time, at the
effective time, each outstanding restricted stock unit award or performance stock unit award in respect of Rice common stock will vest and
be settled within seven business days following the closing date for the merger consideration with respect to each share of Rice common
stock subject to such awards. Performance conditions that are applicable to such Rice

performance stock units will be deemed to have been met at the maximum level specified in the award at the effective time.

Dividend Policy 

        EQT has paid a quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share in respect of its common stock for the past several years. Any future decisions
to pay dividends on EQT common stock will be at the discretion of the EQT board and will depend on the financial condition, results of
operations, capital requirements, and other factors that the EQT board may deem relevant. Subject to limited exceptions, including for
EQT's ordinary course quarterly dividends, the merger agreement prohibits EQT (unless consented to in advance by Rice, which consent
may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) from paying dividends to holders of EQT common stock until the earlier of the
effective time and the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms.

        Since its initial public offering, Rice has not declared any dividends and does not anticipate declaring or providing any cash dividends
to holders of Rice common stock in the foreseeable future. Subject to limited exceptions, the merger agreement prohibits Rice (unless
consented to in advance by EQT, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) from paying dividends to
holders of Rice common stock until the earlier of the effective time and the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its
terms.

        For additional information on the treatment of dividends under the merger agreement, see "The Merger Agreement—Conduct of
Business."

Agreement with Certain Rice Stockholders 

        Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, EQT entered into a voting agreement, attached as Annex F to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, with the named Rice stockholders pursuant to which each of the named Rice stockholders has agreed, among
other matters and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the voting agreement, to vote all of their shares of Rice common
stock in favor of the merger agreement proposal and the other actions contemplated by the merger agreement and against any proposal that
would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the consummation of the merger set forth in the merger agreement not being
fulfilled. As of the record date for the Rice special meeting, the named Rice stockholders held approximately 36,832,830 shares of Rice
common stock in the aggregate, or approximately 15.1% of the voting power of Rice as of the record date.

        The voting agreement will terminate automatically upon the earlier of (i) effective time, (ii) such date and time as the merger
agreement shall be terminated pursuant to its terms or (iii) the termination of voting agreement by mutual written consent of the parties
thereto.

Listing of EQT Common Stock; Delisting of Rice Common Stock 

        It is a condition to the consummation of the merger that the shares of EQT common stock to be issued to Rice stockholders in the
merger be authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

        Shares of Rice common stock currently trade on the NYSE under the stock symbol "RICE." When the merger is completed, the Rice
common stock currently listed on the NYSE will cease to be quoted on the NYSE and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Appraisal Rights and Dissenters' Rights 

EQT

        Under the PBCL, as well as the governing documents of EQT, the shareholders of EQT are not entitled to dissenters' rights in
connection with the merger.

Rice

        Under Delaware law, holders of Rice common stock have the right to dissent from the merger and to receive payment in cash for the
fair value of their shares of Rice common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, as
determined by the court, in lieu of the consideration Rice stockholders would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the merger agreement.
These rights are known as appraisal rights.

        Rice stockholders electing to exercise appraisal rights must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in order to
perfect their rights. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures is required to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.

        The following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of the Delaware statutory procedures required to be followed
by a Rice stockholder in order to dissent from the merger and perfect appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not a complete statement
of all applicable requirements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which appears in
Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Failure to precisely follow any of the statutory procedures set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL may result in a termination or waiver of appraisal rights. All references in this summary to a "stockholder" are to the record holder
of shares of Rice common stock unless otherwise indicated.

        Section 262 requires that stockholders for whom appraisal rights are available be notified not less than 20 days before the
stockholders' meeting to vote on the merger that appraisal rights will be available. A copy of Section 262 must be included with such
notice. This joint proxy statement/prospectus constitutes notice to Rice stockholders of the availability of appraisal rights in connection
with the merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. If a Rice stockholder wishes to consider exercising appraisal rights,
such stockholder should carefully review the text of Section 262 contained in Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus because
failure to timely and properly comply with the requirements of Section 262 will result in the loss of appraisal rights under Delaware law.

        If you are a record holder of shares of Rice common stock and wish to elect to demand appraisal of your shares, you must satisfy each
of the following conditions:

• You must deliver to Rice a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the vote with respect to the merger is taken.
This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting
against the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. Voting against or failing to vote for the adoption
and approval of the merger agreement and the merger by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the
meaning of Section 262. 

• You must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger.
A vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and merger, by proxy or in person, will constitute a
waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for
appraisal. A proxy which does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption and
approval of the merger agreement and the merger. Therefore, a Rice stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights must vote against the merger agreement and the merger or abstain from voting on the merger
agreement and the merger.

• You must continue to hold your shares of Rice common stock through the effective date of the merger. Therefore, a
stockholder who is the record holder of shares of Rice common stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is made
but who thereafter transfers the shares prior to the effective date of the merger will lose any right to appraisal with respect
to such shares.

        If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the merger
consideration, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of Rice common stock. All demands for appraisal should
be addressed to Rice Energy Inc., 2200 Rice Drive, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317, Attention: Corporate Secretary, and must be
delivered before the vote on the merger agreement is taken at the Rice special meeting and should be executed by, or on behalf of, the
record holder of the shares of Rice common stock. The demand must reasonably inform Rice of the identity of the stockholder and the
intention of the stockholder to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares.

        To be effective, a demand for appraisal by a holder of Rice common stock must be made by, or in the name of, such registered
stockholder, fully and correctly, as the stockholder's name appears on his, her or its Rice stock certificate(s). Beneficial owners who do not
also hold the shares of record may not directly make appraisal demands to Rice. The beneficial holder must, in such cases, have the
registered owner, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares. If shares are owned of
record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal should be made by or for the
fiduciary; and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should
be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the
demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the
fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the record owner. A record owner, such as a broker, who holds shares as
a nominee for others, may exercise his or her right of appraisal with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners, while not
exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares as to which appraisal is
sought. Where no number of shares is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of the record
owner.

        If a Rice stockholder holds shares of Rice common stock in a brokerage account or in other nominee form and wishes to exercise
appraisal rights, such stockholder should consult with his, her or its broker or the other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures
for the making of a demand for appraisal by the nominee.

        Within ten days after the effective time, the surviving corporation must give written notice that the merger has become effective to
each former Rice stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the merger agreement
and the merger. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has complied with Section 262 will, upon
written request to the surviving corporation be entitled to receive a written statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted
in favor of the merger agreement and the merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal rights have been received and the
aggregate number of holders of such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Rice common stock held in a voting trust or
by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, request from the surviving corporation the statement described in
the previous sentence. Such written statement will be mailed to the requesting Rice stockholder within ten days after such written request
is received by the surviving corporation or within ten days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever
is later. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, either the surviving corporation or any Rice stockholder who has complied
with the requirements of Section 262 and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights may file a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all Rice stockholders entitled to appraisal. A

Table of Contents

person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Rice common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in
such person's own name, file the petition described in the previous sentence. Upon the filing of the petition by a Rice stockholder, service
of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the surviving corporation. The surviving corporation has no obligation to file such a petition
in the event there are dissenting Rice stockholders. Accordingly, the failure of a Rice stockholder to file such a petition within the period
specified could nullify the Rice stockholder's previously written demand for appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of Rice to file
an appraisal petition, and Rice stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that Rice will file such a petition or that
Rice will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly, Rice stockholders who desire to have their
shares appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the
manner prescribed in Section 262. There is no present intent on the part of Rice to file an appraisal petition, and Rice stockholders seeking
to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that Rice will file such a petition or that it will initiate any negotiations with respect to the
fair value of such shares. Accordingly, Rice stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate any petitions necessary
for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

        If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a Rice stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, the
surviving corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the Delaware Court
of Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all Rice stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving corporation. After notice to
dissenting stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing upon
the petition, and to determine those Rice stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to the appraisal
rights provided thereby. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the Rice stockholders who have demanded appraisal for their shares
to submit their Rice stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if
any Rice stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that
stockholder. After determination of the Rice stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of Rice common stock, the Delaware Court
of Chancery will appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for
good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded
quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during
the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, Rice may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case
interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. When
the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon accrued during the
pendency of the proceeding, if the Delaware Court of Chancery so determines, to the Rice stockholders entitled to receive the same, upon
surrender by such holders of the Rice stock certificates representing those shares.

        In determining fair value, and, if applicable, interest, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant
factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value
in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in

the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered, and that "fair price obviously requires consideration of
all relevant factors involving the value of a company."

        Section 262 provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not
encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that "elements of future
value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of
speculation, may be considered."

        Rice stockholders should be aware that the fair value of shares of Rice common stock as determined under Section 262 could be more
than, the same as, or less than the value that such Rice stockholder is entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement.

        Costs of the appraisal proceeding may be imposed upon the surviving corporation and the Rice stockholders participating in the
appraisal proceeding by the Delaware Court of Chancery as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon the application of a
Rice stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any Rice stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to
be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to appraisal. Any Rice stockholder who had demanded appraisal rights will not,
after the effective time, be entitled to vote shares subject to that demand for any purpose or to receive payments of dividends or any other
distribution with respect to those shares, other than with respect to payment as of a record date prior to the effective time; however, if no
petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time, or if the Rice stockholder delivers a written withdrawal of such
stockholder's demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the terms of the merger within 60 days after the effective time, then the right of
that Rice stockholder to appraisal will cease and that Rice stockholder will be entitled to receive an amount of shares of EQT common
stock equal to the exchange ratio for his, her or its shares of Rice common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. No appraisal
proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any Rice stockholder without the prior approval of the Court, and
such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that any Rice
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party will maintain the right to
withdraw its demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration that such holder would have received pursuant to the merger
agreement within 60 days after the effective date of the merger.

        In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, Rice stockholders who may wish to dissent from the merger and pursue
appraisal rights should consult their legal advisors.

Litigation Relating to the Merger 

        As discussed below, various suits have been filed relating to the merger. EQT and Rice do not expect any of these lawsuits to affect
the planned merger. A description of each matter is set forth below.

        On August 2, 2017, a purported Rice stockholder filed a purported class action complaint in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware, captioned Patrick Gordon v. Rice Energy, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-01067, on behalf of himself and all other Rice
stockholders, against Rice and its directors at the time Rice's proposed merger with EQT was announced. The complaint alleges, among

Rice and its directors at the time the proposed merger was announced. The complaint alleged, among other things, that in connection with
the proposed merger, the defendants provided or supervised the providing of allegedly misleading and incomplete disclosures in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. The complaint sought to recover under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act for the alleged
misstatements and omissions. The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief (including enjoining the proposed merger or, if the
proposed merger had already been implemented, rescinding the transaction and awarding rescissory damages), monetary damages, and an
award of attorneys' and experts' fees. On October 3, 2017, the claims were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.

        On August 15, 2017, an individual and putative derivative lawsuit captioned Ney v. Porges, et al., Case 2:17-cv-01065 was filed in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against the members of the EQT board, with EQT as a nominal
defendant. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the disclosures set forth in the preliminary version of this registration statement
were insufficient, and allegedly failed to disclose information about the compensation of EQT's financial advisor for its potential role in
financing the merger. The parties entered into a memorandum of understanding providing for the resolution of the lawsuit, and providing
for the requested disclosure in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. On September 13, 2017, the parties filed a stipulation dismissing the
action with prejudice as to the named plaintiff, with the court retaining jurisdiction over any potential dispute over attorneys' fees. The
court approved of the stipulation on the same date and dismissed the action.

        EQT has also received a letter dated August 17, 2017 from a purported EQT shareholder demanding that EQT file suit against the
members of the EQT board. The letter alleges, among other things, that the board members breached their fiduciary duties during the
acquisition process, and provided or supervised the allegedly misleading and incomplete disclosures in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following describes the material provisions of the merger agreement and certain exhibits thereto, which is included as Annex A to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference herein. The summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement below and elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement.
This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to
you. EQT and Rice encourage you to read carefully the merger agreement in its entirety before making any investment or voting decisions
as it is the principal legal document governing the business combination between EQT and Rice described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

        The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the
merger agreement. EQT and Rice are responsible for considering whether additional disclosure of material information is required to
make the statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus not misleading. Factual disclosures about EQT or Rice contained in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus or EQT's or Rice's public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures
about EQT or Rice contained in the merger agreement and described in the summary. The representations, warranties and covenants
made in the merger agreement by EQT and Rice are qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by EQT and Rice in
connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties
contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties
were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, and were negotiated with the principal purpose of allocating risk
between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be
subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be different from what is generally relevant to shareholders or stockholders or
applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC, and in some cases are qualified by confidential disclosures that were made by
each party to the other, which disclosures are not reflected in the merger agreement or otherwise publicly disclosed. The representations
and warranties in the merger agreement will not survive the completion of the merger. Moreover, information concerning the subject
matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the date of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or
new information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been included or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions of those provisions
should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find
More Information."

Terms of the Merger; Merger Consideration 

        The merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into Rice, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and Rice shall continue its existence
under the laws of the State of Delaware as the surviving corporation in the merger. Immediately following the merger, the surviving
corporation will merge with and into an indirect wholly owned limited liability company subsidiary of EQT, with that limited liability
company continuing as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of EQT.

        Each share of Rice common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares of Rice common
stock (1) (a) held in treasury by Rice or (b) owned by EQT, Merger Sub or EQT Investments Holdings, LLC, the intermediate subsidiary
of EQT that holds all of Merger Sub's outstanding capital stock, which will automatically be canceled and cease to exist, (2) held by any
wholly owned subsidiary of EQT (other than Merger Sub or EQT Investments Holdings, LLC) or any wholly owned subsidiary of Rice,
which will automatically be converted into a number of shares of EQT common stock equal to the sum of (x) the stock consideration and
(y) the quotient of the cash

consideration and the last reported sale price of EQT common stock on the NYSE (as reported in The Wall Street Journal) on the closing
date, or (3) held by any holder of record who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to and in
compliance with the DGCL), will be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive (i) 0.37 shares of EQT common stock
and (ii) $5.30 in cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes.

        EQT will not issue any fractional shares of EQT common stock in connection with the merger. In lieu of any fractional shares of
common stock to which a Rice stockholder would otherwise have been entitled, the exchange agent will issue a cash payment (without
interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the applicable fractional share of EQT common stock multiplied by (ii) the volume
weighted average price of EQT common stock for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the closing date as reported by
Bloomberg, L.P.

Completion of the Merger 

        Unless the parties agree otherwise, the closing of the merger will take place on the third business day after all the conditions to
closing have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions).

        On the closing date of the merger, Rice and Merger Sub will cause a certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware. The merger will become effective at such time as the certificate of merger has been filed with the Delaware Secretary
of State, unless the parties agree to some other, later time for the completion of the merger and specify that time in the certificate of
merger.

        EQT and Rice have targeted to complete the merger in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, subject to receipt of the required
stockholder and shareholder approvals, regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the merger (described
below under "—Conditions to Completion of the Merger").

Exchange and Payment Procedures 

        No later than substantially concurrently with the effective time, EQT will enter into an agreement with Rice's transfer agent, or
another firm reasonably acceptable to Rice, to act as the exchange agent for the holders of Rice common stock in connection with the
merger and to receive the merger consideration and cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares to such holders.

        As soon as practicable after the effective time (but no later than the second business day after the closing date), an exchange agent
will mail to each holder of record of Rice common stock (whose shares were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration
pursuant to the merger agreement) a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Rice stock certificates and
Rice book-entry shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Upon receipt by the exchange agent of (i) either Rice stock certificates or
Rice book-entry shares and (ii) a signed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such shares will be entitled to receive the merger consideration in exchange therefor.

        EQT, Rice, Merger Sub, the surviving corporation in the merger, the wholly owned limited liability company that will be a party to
the post-closing merger, and the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant
to the merger agreement any amount required to be deducted and withheld under applicable tax laws.

        If any Rice stock certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon receipt of an affidavit and, if reasonably required by the surviving
corporation, the posting of a bond in a reasonable amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the surviving
corporation with respect to such

Rice stock certificate, the exchange agent will issue the merger consideration and any other amounts payable in respect thereof pursuant to
the merger agreement.

        If any portion of the merger consideration deposited with the exchange agent is not claimed within 365 days following the effective
time, such merger consideration will be delivered to EQT, upon demand, and any former holders of Rice common stock who have not
theretofore received the merger consideration will thereafter look only to EQT for payment of their claim for such amounts.

The EQT Board Following the Merger 

        Subject to the approval by EQT's shareholders of the charter amendment proposal, the merger agreement requires EQT to take all
necessary actions to cause the charter amendment to become effective at or immediately following the effective time, and to cause EQT's
amended and restated bylaws to be amended and restated to provide that the size of the EQT board shall be not less than five and no more
than thirteen members.

        EQT is also required to take all necessary corporate action so that Daniel J. Rice IV and Robert F. Vagt (or, in certain circumstances, a
substitute chosen by EQT from the Rice board) are appointed to the EQT board immediately following the effective time, and to nominate
them for election to the EQT board in the proxy statement relating to the first annual meeting of EQT shareholders following the closing
with respect to which a definitive proxy statement has not been filed by EQT prior to the closing (the "Post-Closing Annual Meeting").

        Approval by EQT's shareholders of the charter amendment proposal is not a condition to any party's obligation to complete the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and if the charter amendment proposal has not been approved by EQT's shareholders
prior to the effective time, EQT and its board of directors will only be required to appoint one of Messrs. Rice IV and Vagt (as selected by
Rice) to the EQT board at closing. In that circumstance, EQT would be required to submit a proposal similar to the charter amendment
proposal to its shareholders at the Post-Closing Annual Meeting, and appoint the other Rice designee to the EQT board should the
proposal pass.

Redemption of Certain Securities 

        The merger agreement requires Rice to redeem, prior to the closing, all 36.7 million outstanding common units that were issued by its
subsidiary Rice Energy Operating LLC (the "Operating Company") to certain sellers in connection with Rice's acquisition of Vantage
Energy, LLC and Vantage Energy II, LLC. These common units will convert into shares of Rice common stock and receive the merger
consideration at closing.

        The merger agreement also requires Rice, unless EQT otherwise requests in writing, to cause its subsidiary Rice Midstream Holdings
to exercise its call right with respect to all outstanding Series B Units issued by Rice Midstream Holdings on the closing date.

Representations and Warranties 

        Rice and EQT have each made representations and warranties to the other. Rice's representations and warranties relate to, among
other topics, the following:

• organization, standing and corporate power; 

• capital structure; 

• corporate authority to enter into the merger agreement; 

• the absence of conflicts with, or violations of, contracts and organizational documents;

        Certain of the representations and warranties given by Rice and EQT and Merger Sub, as applicable, are qualified as to "materiality"
or "material adverse effect." For purposes of the merger agreement, a "material adverse effect" with respect to a person means any fact,
circumstance, occurrence, state of fact, effect, change, event or development that, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely
affects (a) the financial condition, business, assets, properties or results of operations of such person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or (b) the ability of such person and its subsidiaries to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. However, no
effect resulting from any of the following shall be deemed to be a "material adverse effect," or shall be taken into account when
determining whether a "material adverse effect" has occurred or may, would or could occur: (i) general economic conditions (or changes in
such conditions) or conditions in the global economy generally; (ii) conditions (or changes in such conditions) in the securities markets,
credit markets, currency markets or other financial markets, including (A) changes in interest rates and changes in exchange rates for the
currencies of any countries and (B) any suspension of trading in securities (whether equity, debt, derivative or hybrid securities) generally
on any securities exchange or over-the-counter market; (iii) conditions (or changes in such conditions) in the oil and gas exploration and
production industry (including changes in commodity prices, general market prices and regulatory changes affecting the industry);
(iv) political conditions (or changes in such conditions) or acts of war, sabotage or terrorism (including any escalation or general
worsening of any such acts of war, sabotage or terrorism); (v) earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes, floods, mudslides, wild fires
or other natural disasters or weather conditions; (vi) the announcement of the merger agreement or the pendency or consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, subject to certain exceptions; (vii) any actions taken or failure to take action, in each case, which EQT
or Rice, as applicable, has requested in writing; (viii) compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any action expressly permitted or

Conduct of Business 

        Under the merger agreement, each of Rice and EQT has agreed to restrict the conduct of its respective businesses between the date of

Conduct of Business by Rice and its Subsidiaries

to preserve substantially intact its present business organization and preserve its existing relationships with its key customers and
suppliers.

No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals 

        Each of EQT and Rice has agreed that it will, and will cause its respective subsidiaries and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its
respective representatives to, cease and terminate any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiations with any person conducted
prior to the execution of the merger agreement with respect to a competing proposal. In addition, the parties have agreed that they will not,
and will cause their respective subsidiaries and will use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals, or offers regarding, or the making of
a competing proposal, (ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect to a competing proposal, (iii) furnish any non-public
information, or access to its properties, assets or employees, to any person

in connection with or in response to a competing proposal, (iv) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle, or other agreement
providing for a competing proposal or (v) resolve, agree or publicly propose to do any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) - (iv).

        Each party has agreed to advise the other party within 48 hours of its receipt of any competing proposal or any request for
discussions, negotiations or non-public information or data in connection therewith, and to provide the other party (within such 48 hour
time frame) either a copy or written summary of any such competing proposal. A party that has received a competing proposal must also
keep the other party reasonably informed regarding its status and material terms, and any material changes to the status of any such
discussions or negotiations, and must promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after transmittal or receipt) provide the other party with
copies of any material correspondence with respect thereto.

        A "competing proposal" means, with respect to the applicable party, any contract, proposal, inquiry, offer or indication of interest
relating to any transaction or series of related transactions involving: (a) any acquisition of any business or assets of the applicable party
that generated 20% or more of the parties' net revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the preceding
twelve (12) months, (b) any acquisition of beneficial ownership by any person or group of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of that
party's common stock or (c) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving that party which is structured to permit any person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least 20%
of the party's assets or equity interests.

        Nevertheless, the parties are permitted, prior to obtaining the applicable shareholder or stockholder approval of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, to engage in the activities described in the first paragraph of this "—No Solicitation of Alternative
Proposals" section solely with and to any person who has made a written, bona fide competing proposal that did not result from a breach
of the applicable party's non-solicitation obligations; provided, that (A) no non-public information may be furnished until the party
receives an executed confidentiality agreement containing limitations on the use and disclosure of non-public information no less
favorable to that party in the aggregate than the terms of the confidentiality agreement between EQT and Rice; and (B) prior to taking any
such actions, the party's board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
competing proposal is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a superior proposal and, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to engage in such activities would be inconsistent with the board's duties under applicable law.

        A "superior proposal" means, with respect to a party, any written proposal by any person or group (other than the other party or any of
its affiliates) to acquire, directly or indirectly, (a) businesses or assets of that party that generated two-thirds or more of the party's net
revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the preceding twelve (12) months, respectively, or (b) more
than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of that party's common stock, that in the good faith determination of the party's board, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel and after taking into account relevant legal, financial, regulatory,
estimated timing of consummation and other aspects of such proposal and the person or group making such proposal, would, if
consummated in accordance with its terms, result in a transaction more favorable to the party's shareholders or stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Change in Board Recommendation 

        EQT and Rice have both agreed that unless specifically permitted by the merger agreement, they will not fail to include in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, in the case of EQT, the recommendation that EQT's shareholders vote in favor of the share issuance proposal
and the charter amendment proposal, and in the case of Rice, the recommendation that Rice's stockholders vote in

favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. In addition, the parties have agreed that they will not (i) withdraw, modify or qualify,
or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to the other party, their respective board recommendations,
(ii) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any competing proposal, (iii) in the event that any
competing proposal has been publicly announced or become publicly known, fail to publicly reaffirm the applicable board
recommendation within ten business days of the other party's request to do so, or (iv) fail to announce publicly within ten business days
after commencement a tender or exchange offer for a party's common stock that the party's board recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer and reaffirms its recommendation in favor of the transactions contemplated by merger agreement. The taking of any action
described in this paragraph is referred to as a "change of recommendation."

        Nevertheless, prior to adoption by Rice stockholders of the merger agreement (in the case of Rice) or approval by EQT shareholders
of the share issuance proposal (in the case of EQT), in response to a competing proposal (in EQT's case, which is conditioned upon the
termination of the merger agreement or the failure of the merger to be consummated) that did not result from a breach of a party's non-
solicitation obligations, if a party's board so chooses, that party may effect a change of recommendation or, solely in the case of Rice,
terminate the merger agreement, if prior to taking such action (A) the applicable party's board determines in good faith after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that the competing proposal is a superior proposal (taking into account any adjustment
to the terms and conditions of the merger proposed by the other party in response to such competing proposal), (B) the party's board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its duties under
applicable law, and (C) the party shall have given notice to the other party that it has received such proposal, specifying the material terms
and conditions thereof, and, that the party intends to take such action, and the other party shall not have proposed revisions to the terms
and conditions of the merger agreement within three business days thereof which cause the competing proposal to no longer constitute a
superior proposal. If there are material modifications to the financial terms of a competing proposal determined by a party's board to be a
superior proposal, the time period specified in the preceding sentence shall be extended for 48 hours after notification of such change to
the other party.

        In addition, prior to adoption by Rice stockholders of the merger agreement (in the case of Rice) or approval by EQT shareholders of
the share issuance proposal (in the case of EQT), in response to an intervening event that occurs or arises after the date of the merger
agreement, if a party's board so chooses, that party may effect a change of recommendation if prior to taking such action (A) the applicable
party's board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable law, (B) the party shall have given notice to the other party that it has determined that an
intervening event has occurred and that it intends to effect a change of recommendation, and either (1) the other party shall not have
proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement within four business days thereof, or (2) if the other party shall
have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement which fail to obviate the need for the board to effect a change
of recommendation.

        An "intervening event" means, with respect to a party, a development, event, effect, state of facts, condition, occurrence or change in
circumstance that is material to that party and that occurs or arises after the date of the merger agreement that was not known to or
reasonably foreseeable by the party's board as of the date of the merger agreement. However, in no event shall (i) the receipt, existence or
terms of a competing proposal, (ii) changes in general economic circumstances or industry or market conditions (including commodity
prices) or (iii) the fact that a party exceeds internal or published projections or guidance or any related matter constitute an intervening
event.

Financing Cooperation 

        The merger agreement requires Rice to use reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by EQT, or as EQT
may reasonably determine necessary or advisable, in connection with financing arrangements (including, without limitation, assisting in
the arrangement of new financing arrangements and any assumptions, guarantees, amendments, supplements, modifications, refinancings,
replacements, repayments, redemptions, terminations or prepayments of existing financing arrangements of EQT or Rice or their
respective subsidiaries) to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration, the completion of the merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement or to be consummated in connection therewith and the payment of related fees and expenses.

        The merger is not conditioned upon receipt by EQT of the proceeds of borrowings or any other financing.

Efforts to Close the Merger 

        Rice, EQT and Merger Sub have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate in the
most expeditious manner practicable the merger.

        Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to antitrust laws as described below, promptly following the execution of the
merger agreement, EQT, Rice and Merger Sub shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate governmental entities all
authorizations, consents, notifications, certifications, registrations, declarations and filings that are necessary in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and shall diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and cooperate fully with each other
in the prosecution of, such matters.

        EQT and Rice shall cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any filings under antitrust laws. Unless otherwise
agreed, EQT and Rice shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act. EQT and Rice shall use their reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply with any request for information
or documentary material from any governmental entity charged with enforcing, applying, administering, or investigating the HSR Act or
any other law designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of mergers, monopolization, restraining trade or
abusing a dominant position, including the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ, any attorney general of any state of the United States,
or any other competition authority of any jurisdiction (collectively, the "antitrust authorities"). In connection therewith, EQT and Rice
shall:

• use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; 

• promptly notify the other party of any communication concerning the merger agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated thereby to the notifying party from or with any governmental entity, or from any other person alleging that
the consent of such person (or another person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions, and consider in
good faith the views of the other party and keep the other party reasonably informed of the status of matters related to the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including furnishing the other party with any written notices or other
communications received by such party from, or given by such party to, any governmental entity and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions

contemplated by the merger agreement (except that any materials concerning one party's valuation of the other may be
redacted); and

• permit the other party to review in draft any proposed communication to be submitted by the notifying party to any
governmental entity with reasonable time and opportunity to comment, and consult with each other in advance of any in-
person or telephonic meeting or conference with any governmental entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other person, and, to the extent permitted by the applicable governmental entity or person, not agree
to participate in any meeting or discussion with any governmental entity relating to any filings or investigations concerning
the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby unless it consults with the other party and its
representatives in advance and invites the other party's representatives to attend in accordance with applicable law.

        EQT shall be entitled to direct any proceedings with any antitrust authorities; provided, however, that it shall afford Rice a reasonable
opportunity to participate in such proceedings. The parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other so as to preserve any applicable privilege.

        EQT and Rice and their respective subsidiaries shall also use their reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement under any laws, including any antitrust laws; provided,
however, that if, in order to resolve any objections, Rice is asked to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to
take any action that limits its freedom with respect to its or its subsidiaries' ability to retain any of the businesses, product lines, or assets of
Rice or its subsidiaries, such actions shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the merger. In furtherance of the foregoing, EQT and
Rice and their respective subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or transactions contemplated thereby (including seeking to have any stay,
temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction entered by any court or other governmental entity vacated or reversed).

        EQT and Merger Sub shall not take any action that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or the
expiration of the required waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust law.

Efforts to Hold the Rice and EQT Special Meetings 

        Subject to its rights in certain circumstances to postpone or adjourn the Rice stockholder meeting, Rice has agreed to hold a meeting
of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining its stockholders' adoption of the merger agreement
proposal. Under the merger agreement, Rice has agreed to submit these proposals to a stockholder vote even if the Rice board has made an
adverse recommendation change (as described above under "—Change in Board Recommendation"), except that Rice may terminate the
merger agreement (and thus avoid holding a special meeting) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal (as
described above under "—No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals").

        Subject to its rights in certain circumstances to postpone or adjourn the EQT shareholder meeting, EQT has agreed to hold a meeting
of its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining EQT shareholder approval of the share issuance
proposal.

        Rice and EQT will use their respective best reasonable efforts to hold their respective meetings on the same date.

        From the effective time and until the six year anniversary of the effective time, EQT and the surviving company shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to June 19, 2017 or who becomes
prior to the effective time, a director, officer or employee of Rice or any of its subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary under any Rice equity
plan or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Rice or any of its subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise (collectively,
the "indemnified persons") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys' and other
professionals' fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement, of or incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual proceeding to which such indemnified person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) if such
liabilities arose by reason of such indemnified person's service at the request or for the benefit of Rice. EQT and the surviving company
shall also jointly and severally pay expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any such proceeding to each indemnified
person to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. In the event any such proceeding is brought or threatened to be brought against
any indemnified persons (whether arising before or after the effective time), (i) the indemnified persons may retain Rice's regularly
engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to such indemnified persons, and EQT and the surviving company shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the indemnified persons, and (ii) EQT and the surviving company shall use their best
efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter.

        The merger agreement also provides that EQT and the surviving company will cause to be put in place, and EQT shall fully prepay
immediately prior to, and conditioned upon the occurrence of, the effective time, "tail" insurance policies with a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six years from the effective time placed, such "tail" policies to be placed with insurance companies having the
same or better "AM Best Financial" rating as Rice's and RMP's current directors' and officers' liability insurance companies and with terms
and conditions providing retentions, limits and other material terms no less favorable than the current directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies maintained by Rice and RMP with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the effective
time; provided, however, that EQT may elect in its sole discretion to, but shall not be required to, spend more than 300% of the last annual
premium paid by Rice and RMP prior to June 19, 2017 (the "cap amount") for the six years of coverage under such "tail" policy. If the cost
of such "tail" policy exceeds the cap amount, and EQT elects not to spend more than the cap amount for such purpose, then EQT shall
purchase as much coverage as is reasonably available for the cap amount.

Other Covenants and Agreements 

        The merger agreement contains certain other covenants and agreements, including, among other things, covenants relating to:

• cooperation between Rice and EQT in the preparation of this joint proxy statement/prospectus; 

• access by each party to certain information about the other party during the period prior to the effective time or termination
of the merger agreement, as applicable; 

• certain employee matters; 

• participation in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation relating to the transactions; 

• advice and reports on operational matters;

• the receipt by Rice of a written tax opinion from Vinson & Elkins LLP, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Rice and dated as of the closing date, to the effect that, on the basis of the facts, representations and assumptions set forth
or referred to in such opinion, the mergers, taken together, will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

        The obligations of EQT and Merger Sub to effect the merger are also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by EQT of the following
additional conditions:

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Rice set forth in the merger agreement, subject to the materiality
standards set forth in the merger agreement, as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing date of the merger

the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

        As further discussed under the section titled "Risk Factors," neither EQT nor Rice can be certain when, or if, the conditions to the
merger will be satisfied or waived, or that the merger will be completed.

        None of EQT, Rice or Merger Sub may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the merger or for terminating the merger
agreement (as described below), on the failure of any condition set forth above, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was
caused by such party's breach in any material respect of any provision of the merger agreement.

Termination of the Merger Agreement 

        Rice and EQT may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement before consummating the merger, even after adoption of the
merger agreement proposal by Rice stockholders and approval of the share issuance proposal by EQT shareholders.

        In addition, either EQT or Rice may terminate the merger agreement if:

• any governmental authority having jurisdiction over any party shall have issued any order, decree, ruling or injunction or
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger and
such order, decree, ruling or injunction or other action shall have become final and nonappealable, or if there shall be
adopted any law that permanently makes consummation of the merger illegal or otherwise permanently prohibited
(provided that this right to terminate the merger agreement shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
material covenant or agreement under the merger agreement has been the cause of or resulted in such injunction or law);

• subject to certain exceptions, the merger is not consummated by the end date (provided that this right to terminate the
merger agreement shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any material covenant or agreement under the
merger agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before the end date); 

• subject to certain exceptions, there has been a breach of the merger agreement by the other party or there has been a failure
to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (i) if it was continuing to occur on the closing date, would result in a failure of a condition to
close by such breaching party and (2) is incapable of being cured during the time period set forth in the merger agreement
or, if curable, is not cured during the applicable cure period (provided the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement
pursuant to this provision is not then in terminable breach); 

• if the Rice special meeting has concluded without adoption of the merger agreement proposal by Rice stockholders or if the
EQT special meeting has concluded without approval of EQT shareholders of the share issuance proposal; or 

• prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Rice stockholders or approval of the share issuance by EQT shareholders,
as applicable, the other party (i) makes an adverse recommendation change or (ii) is in material violation of its non-
solicitation obligations.

        Rice may also terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Rice superior proposal
(provided that contemporaneous with such termination Rice tenders a termination fee payment to EQT).

Expenses and Termination Fees Relating to the Termination of the Merger Agreement 

        Rice or EQT, as applicable, will be obligated to pay the other party a termination fee of $255 million in the following circumstances:

• if such party effects an adverse recommendation change or such party commits a material breach of its non-solicitation
obligations; or 

• (i) a competing proposal has been announced, disclosed or otherwise communicated to the Rice board or the EQT board, as
applicable, and not withdrawn by a date that is at least three business days prior to the Rice special meeting or EQT special
meeting, as applicable, or at least three business days prior to the termination of the merger agreement due to occurrence of
the end date or a terminable breach by Rice or EQT, as applicable, (ii) thereafter, the merger agreement is terminated
because the other party's shareholders fail to adopt the merger agreement or approve the share issuance, as applicable, or
because of the occurrence of the end date or a terminable breach by the other party and (iii) within twelve months of the
termination of the merger agreement, the other party enters into a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to or
consummates a transaction that is a competing proposal with a third party.

        Rice will also be required to pay a termination fee of $255 million if Rice terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into a
superior proposal.

        In addition, unless otherwise entitled to the $255 million termination fee, EQT or Rice will be obligated to pay the other party an
expense reimbursement fee of $67 million if such party's shareholders fail to adopt the merger agreement or approve the share issuance, as
applicable.

        In no event shall either party be entitled to receive more than one termination fee and one expense reimbursement fee. If a party
receives a termination fee, then such party will not be entitled to also receive an expense reimbursement fee, and any payment of the
expense reimbursement fee shall be fully creditable against any subsequent payment of the termination fee.

Amendments and Waivers

agreement by Rice stockholders. However, after such stockholder approval is obtained, there may not be, without further approval of Rice
stockholders, any amendment or waiver of any provision of the merger agreement for which applicable laws requires further approval by
Rice stockholders.

Specific Performance 

        In addition to any other remedy that may be available to each party, including monetary damages, each of the parties will be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of the merger
agreement and to enforce specifically its terms and provisions.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Introduction 

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements (the "pro forma financial statements") have been
prepared to reflect the effects of the merger on the financial statements of EQT. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance
sheet (the "pro forma balance sheet") is presented as if the merger had occurred on June 30, 2017. The unaudited pro forma combined
statements of operations (the "pro forma statements of operations") for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the six months ended
June 30, 2017, are presented as if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2016. The historical consolidated financial information has been
adjusted to reflect factually supportable items that are directly attributable to the merger and, with respect to the statements of operations
only, are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results.

        The following unaudited pro forma financial statements, derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of EQT and
Rice, have been adjusted to reflect the following:

• EQT's merger with Rice under the acquisition method of accounting; 

• assumed conversion of common units in Rice Energy Operating LLC into the right to receive the consideration received by
holders of Rice's common stock in the merger; 

• assumed redemption of the Series B preferred interest in Rice Midstream Holdings by EQT for $430 million and the related
elimination of preferred dividends and accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interests; 

• adjustments to Rice's historical consolidated financial statements to reflect the acquisition of Vantage Energy LLC and
Vantage Energy II, LLC (collectively, "Vantage") as though that acquisition occurred on January 1, 2016; 

• elimination of historical transactions between Rice and EQT that would be treated as intercompany transactions after the
merger; 

• issuance of $3.0 billion in new EQT notes (which EQT priced on September 27, 2017 and expects to close on October 4,
2017), with maturities of three, five and ten years (the "EQT notes"), to fund a portion of the cash merger consideration and
the planned extinguishment of Rice's senior notes (the "Rice notes"), Rice's revolving credit facility (the "Rice credit
facility") and Rice Midstream Holdings LLC's revolving credit facility (the "Rice Midstream Holdings credit facility," and
together with the Rice credit facility, the "Rice credit facilities") as the interest rate and terms on the Rice notes and Rice
credit facilities are significantly less favorable than what EQT obtained with this issuance; 

• planned upsize of (which EQT completed on July 31, 2017), and borrowing under, EQT's revolving credit facility; 

• assumption of liabilities for transaction-related expenses; 

• adjustment of depreciation, depletion and amortization related to the step up of property, plant and equipment to estimated
fair value and to adjust the depreciation expense on certain Rice midstream assets to EQT's depreciation policies; 

• amortization of the intangible asset identified as part of the assets acquired; and 

• estimated tax impact of pro forma adjustments.

        The pro forma financial statements have been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting using the accounting guidance in
Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"), with EQT treated as the acquirer. The acquisition method of
accounting is dependent

upon certain valuations and other studies that have yet to commence or progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a
definitive measure. Accordingly, the pro forma adjustments are preliminary, have been made solely for the purpose of providing pro forma
financial statements, and are subject to revision based on a final determination of fair value as of the date of acquisition. Differences
between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting may have a material impact on the accompanying pro forma
financial statements and the combined company's future results of operations and financial position.

        The pro forma financial statements are provided for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual
consolidated results of operations or the consolidated financial position of EQT would have been had the merger occurred on the dates
assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position. The pro forma
financial statements should be read in conjunction with:

• The accompanying notes to the pro forma financial statements; 

• The audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of EQT contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-
K for the year ended December 31, 2016, incorporated by reference herein;

K for the year ended December 31, 2016, incorporated by reference herein;

Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2017, incorporated by reference herein;

Energy II, LLC contained in EQT's Current Report on Form 8-K filed September 27, 2017, incorporated by reference

EQT CORPORATION
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1.  Basis of Presentation

        The pro forma financial statements have been prepared to reflect the effects of the merger on the financial statements of EQT. The pro
forma balance sheet is presented as if the merger had occurred on June 30, 2017. The pro forma statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2016, and the six months ended June 30, 2017, are presented as if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2016. The
historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted to reflect factually supportable items that are directly attributable to the
merger and, with respect to the statements of operations only, are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results.

        The pro forma financial statements have been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting using the accounting guidance in
ASC 805, with EQT treated as the acquirer. The acquisition method of accounting is dependent upon certain valuations and other studies
that have yet to commence or progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive measure. Accordingly, the pro forma
adjustments are preliminary, have been made solely for the purpose of providing pro forma financial statements, and are subject to revision
based on a final determination of fair value as of the date of acquisition. Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final
acquisition accounting may have a material impact on the accompanying pro forma financial statements and the combined company's
future results of operations and financial position.

        The pro forma financial statements are provided for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual
consolidated results of operations or the consolidated financial position of EQT would have been had the merger occurred on the dates
assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position.

2.  Pro Forma Adjustments and Assumptions

        The adjustments are based on currently available information and certain assumptions that EQT believes are reasonable. The actual
effects of these transactions will differ from the pro forma adjustments. A general description of these transactions and adjustments are
provided as follows:

        (a)   These adjustments reflect the estimated value of net consideration to be paid by EQT in the merger and the adjustment of the
historical book values of Rice assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2017 to their estimated fair values. The following table represents the
preliminary purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Rice. This preliminary purchase price allocation
has been used to prepare pro forma adjustments in the pro forma balance sheet and the pro forma statements of operations. The final
purchase price allocation will be determined when EQT has completed the detailed valuations and necessary calculations subsequent to
closing the merger. The final purchase price allocation will differ from these estimates and could differ materially from the preliminary
allocation used in the pro forma adjustments. EQT expects to finalize its allocation of the merger consideration as soon as practicable after
completion of the merger.

        The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to change as a result of several factors, including but not limited to:

• changes in the estimated fair value of the shares of EQT common stock issued as consideration to the Rice stockholders,
based on EQT's share price at the effective time of the merger; 

• finalization of assumed and retired Rice indebtedness; 

• changes in the estimated fair value of the Rice assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the merger, which
could result from changes in future commodity prices, reserve estimates, inclusion of drilling synergies, other changes in
cost assumptions, interest rates and

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1588238/000104746917006341/a2233529zdefm14a.htm 194/223

Table of Contents

other facts and circumstances existing at the closing date of the merger compared to the filing date of the pro forma
financial statements;

• the tax basis of Rice's assets and liabilities as of the effective time of the merger; 

• changes in the fair value of the noncontrolling interest attributable to the public unit holders of RMP, based on RMP's share
price at the effective time of the merger; and 

• the risk factors described in "Risk Factors."

        As part of the preliminary price allocation, EQT identified an intangible asset for customer contracts and the related customer
relationships in Rice's midstream business. The fair value of the identified intangible asset was determined using the income approach
which requires a forecast of the expected future cash flows generated by these customer relationships. Goodwill is recognized to offset net
deferred tax liabilities arising from differences between the purchase price allocated to Rice's assets and liabilities based on fair value and
the tax basis of these assets and liabilities. The merger and the post-closing merger, taken together, are intended to be treated for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; therefore, Rice's tax basis in its assets
and liabilities will carry over to EQT and EQT must recognize a deferred tax liability for the net increase in the book value. The goodwill
is also attributable to EQT's qualitative assumptions of long-term value that the merger creates for EQT shareholders, including additional
capital efficiencies from longer laterals and lower development costs on the expanded and concentrated acreage position created by the
merger, and substantial operating and administrative synergies. Differences between the

Table of Contents

preliminary purchase price allocation and the final purchase price allocation may change the amount of intangible asset and goodwill, if
any, actually recognized at the effective time of the merger.

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, EQT will pay $5.30 in cash and issue 0.37 of a share of EQT common stock for each share of Rice
common stock outstanding at the effective time of the merger, which would result in the issuance by EQT of approximately 92,198,000
shares of EQT common stock valued at $5,988 million (based on the closing price as of September 26, 2017 of $64.95) and payment of
$1,321 million in cash. This includes the conversion of common units in Rice Energy Operating LLC into the right to receive the merger
consideration received by holders of Rice common stock in the merger. In addition, Rice will exercise its call right with respect to the
Series B preferred equity interest in Rice Midstream Holdings, and EQT will pay approximately $430 million in cash at closing to redeem
this interest.

        From June 16, 2017, the last trading date prior to the transaction's initial announcement, to September 26, 2017, the preliminary value
of EQT's merger consideration to be transferred had increased by approximately $569.8 million, as a result of the increase in the share
price for EQT's common stock from $58.77 to $64.95. The final value of total merger consideration paid by EQT will be determined based
on the actual number of EQT shares issued and the market price of EQT's common stock at the effective time of the merger. A ten percent
increase or decrease in the closing price of EQT common stock, as compared to the September 26, 2017 closing price of $64.95, would
increase or decrease the total consideration by approximately $598.8 million, assuming all other factors are held constant.

        The pro forma fair value of natural gas and oil properties to be acquired includes the following (in thousands):

        NYMEX strip pricing as of June 30, 2017 was utilized in determining the pro forma fair value of proved producing reserves at a
discount rate of 8.0%, after adjustment for expenses and basis differential. An increase or decrease in commodity price as of the closing
date will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the fair value of proved producing properties.

        (b)   The following pro forma adjustments eliminate historical transactions between Rice and EQT that would be treated as
intercompany transactions after the merger:

1. Elimination of $9.7 million of receivables and corresponding payables, consisting of $6.7 million for gathering
transactions, $2.5 million for gas sales transactions, and $0.5 million for transmission transactions in the pro forma balance
sheet as of June 30, 2017. 

2. Elimination of $19.9 million in revenue and corresponding expenses related to the elimination of $17.1 million of gathering
transactions and $2.8 million of transmission transactions in the pro forma statement of operations for the period ended
June 30, 2017. 

3. Elimination of $41.5 million in revenue and corresponding expenses related to the elimination of $38.1 million of gathering
transactions and $3.4 million of transmission transactions in the pro forma statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2016.

        (c)   Certain adjustments that are directly related to the merger were made to debt and debt related accounts. These adjustments
include the planned extinguishment of the Rice notes and the Rice credit facilities at or near closing. The issuance of $3.0 billion of EQT
notes and the planned upsize of EQT's revolving credit facility were to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration and to

support ongoing operations with better interest rates and terms available to EQT as a result of the Company's investment grade credit
rating. The adjustments are as follows:

1. A $1,464.5 million increase to cash reflecting the issuance of $3.0 billion of EQT notes, net of $25.7 million of issuance
costs and discounts, repayment of the Rice notes, including call premium, of $1,377.0 million, $14.2 million of accrued
interest on the Rice notes, repayment of $112.5 million of outstanding amounts on the Rice Midstream Holdings credit
facility and $6.1 million of estimated debt issuance costs for fees related to increasing EQT's revolving credit facility to
support the merger. 

2. A $6.1 million increase to deferred financing costs of estimated debt issuance costs for fees related to increasing EQT's
revolving credit facility to support the merger. 

3. A $1,484.8 million increase to long term debt reflecting the anticipated issuance of $3.0 billion of EQT notes, net of
$25.7 million of issuance costs offset by the repayment of the Rice notes recorded at fair value of $1,377.0 million and the
repayment of $112.5 million of outstanding amounts on the Rice Midstream Holdings credit facility. 

4. A $0.9 million decrease in interest expense for the period ended June 30, 2017 consisting of the elimination of
$49.9 million of Rice historical interest expense and an increase to interest expense of $49 million relating to the issuance
of the EQT notes at a weighted average interest rate of 3.14% per annum and amortization of associated deferred financing
costs and discounts. 

5. A $4.0 million pro forma adjustment was made to eliminate the amortization of deferred financing costs related to the Rice
notes and the Rice credit facilities for the period ended June 30, 2017. 

6. A $31.9 million decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisting of the elimination of
$129.9 million of Rice pro forma interest expense, including $34.3 million of pro forma Vantage interest expense, and an
increase to interest expense of $98.0 million relating to the issuance of the EQT notes at a weighted average interest rate of
3.14% per annum and amortization of associated deferred financing costs and discounts. 

7. A $6.1 million pro forma adjustment was made to eliminate the amortization of deferred financing costs related to the Rice
notes and the Rice credit facilities for the year ended December 31, 2016.

        A one percent change in the assumed interest rate of the EQT notes would increase or decrease the interest expense by $15.0 million
and $30.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.

        (d)   To accrue for estimated remaining transaction costs of $82.4 million related to the merger, including underwriting, banking, legal
and accounting fees that are not capitalized as part of the merger. The estimated remaining costs are not reflected in the historical June 30,
2017 balance sheets of EQT and Rice, but are reflected in the pro forma balance sheet as an increase to liabilities as they will be expensed
by EQT and Rice as incurred. Transaction expenses recognized in the six months ended June 30, 2017 and their corresponding tax effect
have been eliminated in the pro forma statements of operations due to their nonrecurring nature.

        (f)    Pro forma adjustment of historical depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) related to the step up of property,
plant and equipment to estimated fair value. In addition, this adjustment includes a pro forma adjustment for DD&A to adjust the
depreciation on certain Rice midstream assets to EQT's policy to depreciate gathering pipelines over a 50 year useful life and to depreciate
compression and measurement assets over a 25 year useful life.

        (g)   As part of the preliminary price allocation, EQT identified intangible assets related to Rice's Midstream business. This pro forma
adjustment reflects the amortization of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired using a 30 year estimated life and a straight line
method of amortization.

        (h)   Pro forma adjustment for elimination of preferred dividends and accretion of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to
EQT's redemption of the Series B preferred interest in Rice Midstream Holdings for $430 million. A pro forma adjustment of
$15.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was also made to eliminate the loss on embedded derivatives as it relates to the
option on the Series B preferred interest which will be redeemed at the merger as reflected in pro forma adjustment (a).

        (i)    The pro forma income tax adjustments included in the pro forma statement of operations for the periods ended June 30, 2017 and
December 31, 2016 reflect the income tax effects of the pro forma adjustments presented. The tax rate applied to the pro forma
adjustments was the statutory federal and apportioned statutory state tax rate, net of the federal benefit of state taxes, applied to pre-tax
income, excluding income allocated to noncontrolling interests as taxes attributable to noncontrolling interests and not borne by EQT. No
adjustment has been included in the pro forma statement of operations for potential adjustments to EQT's valuation allowance on deferred
tax assets due to the nonrecurring nature of any such adjustment.

        (j)    The following reclassifications were made as a result of the transaction to conform to EQT's presentation:

1. Reclassification of $45.7 million of long term derivative assets, $24.6 million of long term derivative liabilities, to current
and an increase of $168.6 million to current derivative assets and liabilities to conform to EQT's presentation of
derivatives. 

2. Reclassification of $5.3 million of Rice's gas collateral account to other assets. 

3. Reclassification of $104.1 million of Rice's royalties payable to accounts payable. 

4. Reclassification of $176.6 million of Rice's accrued capital expenditures to accounts payable. 

5. Reclassification of $19.5 million of Rice's current leasehold payable to other current liabilities. 

6. Reclassification of $0.3 million of Rice's accrued interest to other current liabilities. 

7. Reclassification of $12.3 million of Rice's long-term leasehold payable to other long term liabilities. 

8. Reclassification on the June 30, 2017 pro forma statement of operations of $68.4 million of Rice's gathering, compression
and water services to pipeline and net market services. 

9. Reclassification on the June 30, 2017 pro forma statement of operations of $18.0 million of Rice's other revenue to pipeline
and net marketing services.

to selling, general and administrative expense. 

22. Reclassification on the December 31, 2016 pro forma statement of operations of $1.5 million of Rice's amortization of
deferred financing costs to interest expense.

        The pro forma financial statements do not reflect any compensation related adjustments as certain personnel matters are evolving and
any recurring impact from compensation adjustments would not be factually supportable. In addition, the combined pro forma financial
statements do not reflect the realization of any expected cost savings or other synergies from the merger as a result of restructuring
activities and other cost savings initiatives. Although EQT believes cost savings and other synergies will be realized following the business
combination, there can be no assurance that cost savings or any other synergies will be achieved in full or at all. In addition, the pro forma
financial statements do not reflect the planned restructuring charges associated with these cost savings, which are expected to be expensed
in EQT's statement of operations.

DESCRIPTION OF EQT CAPITAL STOCK 

        The following description of the material terms of the EQT capital stock is a summary only and is not a complete description of such
terms. Following completion of the transactions, the rights of the holders of EQT common stock will be governed by the PBCL, the EQT
articles and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of EQT (the "EQT bylaws"). Copies of the EQT articles and the EQT bylaws have been
filed as Exhibits to EQT's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and are incorporated by reference into this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. See also "Where You Can Find More Information." EQT and Rice urge you to read the EQT articles and
the EQT bylaws carefully and in their entirety.

General 

        Under the EQT articles, EQT is authorized to issue 320,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value, and 3,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, no par value. As of the close of business on the record date for the EQT special meeting, there were approximately
173,832,392 shares of EQT common stock and no shares of EQT preferred stock issued and outstanding. In this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, EQT common stock and EQT preferred stock are collectively referred to as "EQT stock."

EQT Common Stock 

Voting Rights

        Each share of EQT common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters requiring a vote of shareholders. Shareholders do not have
cumulative voting rights in elections of directors. A director nominee is elected to the board of directors at a meeting of shareholders if the
votes cast "for" such nominee exceed the votes cast "against" such nominee (excluding abstentions), unless the number of nominees
exceeds the number of directors to be elected, in which case the nominees receiving the highest number of votes up to the number of
directors to be elected are elected.

Dividend Rights

        Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock, each share of EQT common stock is entitled to
receive any dividends, in cash, securities or property, as the EQT board may declare. Pennsylvania law prohibits the payment of dividends
if EQT is insolvent or if EQT would become insolvent after the dividend or repurchase.

Liquidation and Other Rights

        In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up, either voluntarily or involuntarily, of EQT, subject to the rights of the
holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock, holders of common stock are entitled to share pro-rata in all of EQT's remaining
assets available for distribution.

Exchange Listing

        EQT common stock is listed on the NYSE and traded under the symbol "EQT."

Transfer Agent and Registrar

        The transfer agent and registrar for EQT common stock is Computershare.

Miscellaneous

        The holders of EQT common stock do not have preemptive rights or conversion rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund
provisions applicable to EQT's common stock. Holders of fully paid shares of EQT's common stock are not subject to any liability for
further calls or assessments.

Description of Preferred Stock 

        Under Pennsylvania law and the EQT articles, the EQT board is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock from time to time in one
or more series without shareholder approval. Subject to limitations prescribed by Pennsylvania law, the EQT articles and the EQT bylaws,
the EQT board can determine the number of shares constituting each series of preferred stock and the designation, preferences,
qualifications, limitations, restrictions, and special or relative rights or privileges of that series.

        Holders of EQT preferred stock have no voting rights for the election of directors and have no other voting rights except as the EQT
board may determine pursuant to its authority under the EQT articles with respect to any particular series of EQT preferred stock and
except as provided by law.

        The particular terms of any series of EQT preferred stock will be set by the EQT board for that series of preferred stock. Those terms
may include:

• the distinctive serial designation of such series; 

• the annual dividend rate for such series, if any, and the date or dates from which dividends shall commence to accrue; 

• the redemption price or prices, if any, for shares of such series and the terms and conditions on which such shares may be
redeemed; 

• the provisions for a sinking, purchase or similar fund, if any, for the redemption or purchase of shares of such series; 

• the preferential amount or amounts payable upon shares of such series in the event of EQT's voluntary or involuntary
liquidation; 

• the voting rights, if any, of such series; 

• the terms and conditions, if any, upon which shares of such series may be converted and the class or classes or series of
EQT's securities into which such shares may be converted; 

• the relative seniority, parity or junior rank of such series with respect to other series of preferred stock then or thereafter to
be issued; and 

• any other specific terms, preferences, rights, privileges, limitations or restrictions of such series.

        While the terms summarized above may generally apply to any shares of preferred stock that EQT may offer, the EQT board will
include the specific terms of each series of preferred stock in a statement with respect to preferred stock that will be filed with the
Pennsylvania Department of State.

Anti-Takeover Effect of EQT's Governing Documents and Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law 

        The EQT articles and the EQT bylaws contain a number of provisions relating to corporate governance and to the rights of EQT
shareholders. Certain of these provisions may have a potential "anti-takeover" effect by delaying, deferring or preventing a change of
control of EQT. In addition, certain provisions of Pennsylvania law may have a similar effect.

Table of Contents

Required Vote for Authorization of Certain Actions

        The EQT articles require the vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding shares of
capital stock of all classes and series entitled to vote generally in the annual election of directors, voting together as a single class, for
approval of certain business combinations, including certain mergers, asset sales, security issuances, recapitalizations, reorganizations,
reclassification of securities, liquidation or dissolution, or any agreement, plan, contract or other arrangement providing for such a
transaction, involving EQT or its subsidiaries and certain acquiring persons (namely a person, entity or specified group which beneficially
owns more than 10% of the then outstanding shares of EQT's capital stock entitled to vote generally in an annual election of directors),
unless such business combination has been approved by two-thirds of the continuing directors, or the aggregate amount of cash, together
with the "fair market value" of other consideration, is not less than the "highest equivalent price" threshold and other procedural
requirements specified in the EQT articles are met.

Required Vote for Amendment of the EQT Articles and the EQT Bylaws

        Except as may be specifically provided to the contrary in any provision in the EQT articles with respect to amendment or repeal of
such provision, the EQT articles cannot be amended and no provision may be repealed by its shareholders without a vote of the holders of
not less than 80% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of EQT's capital stock entitled to vote in an annual election of
directors of EQT, voting together as a single class, unless such amendment has been approved by two-thirds of EQT's whole board of
directors, in which event (unless otherwise expressly provided in the EQT articles) the EQT articles may be amended and any provision
repealed by such shareholder approval as may be specified by law. The EQT board may make, amend and repeal the EQT bylaws with
respect to those matters which are not, by statute, reserved exclusively to EQT's shareholders, subject to the power of EQT's shareholders
to change such action. No bylaw may be made, amended or repealed by EQT's shareholders unless such action is approved by the
affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of EQT's capital stock entitled to
vote in an annual election of directors, voting together as a single class, unless such amendment has been approved by two-thirds of EQT's
whole board of directors, in which event (unless otherwise expressly provided in the EQT articles or the EQT bylaws) the EQT bylaws
may be amended and any provision may be repealed by such shareholder approval as may be specified by law.

Preferred Stock

        The purpose of authorizing the EQT board to issue preferred stock and determine its rights and preferences is to eliminate delays
associated with a shareholder vote on specific issuances. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in
connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to
acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, a majority of EQT's outstanding voting stock. The existence of the
authorized but undesignated preferred stock may have a depressive effect on the market price of EQT's common stock.

Anti-Takeover Law Provisions under the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law

        EQT is subject to certain provisions of Chapter 25 of the PBCL, which may have the effect of discouraging or rendering more
difficult a hostile takeover attempt against EQT, including Section 2524, Section 2538, Subchapter 25E and Subchapter 25F of the PBCL.

        Under Section 2524 of the PBCL, shareholders of EQT cannot act by partial written consent except as permitted under the EQT
articles.

Table of Contents

        Section 2538 of the PBCL requires enhanced shareholder approval for certain transactions between EQT and an "interested
shareholder" (defined as a shareholder who is a party to the transaction or is treated differently from other shareholders). Section 2538
applies if an interested shareholder (together with his, her or its affiliates) is to (i) be a party to a merger or consolidation, a share exchange
or certain sales of assets involving EQT or one of EQT's subsidiaries; (ii) receive a disproportionate amount of any securities of any
corporation which survives or results from a division; (iii) be treated differently from others holding shares of the same class in a voluntary
dissolution of such corporation; or (iv) have his or her percentage of voting or economic share interest in such corporation materially
increased relative to substantially all other shareholders in a reclassification. Under these circumstances, the proposed transaction must be
approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares representing at least a majority of the votes that all disinterested shareholders are
entitled to cast with respect to such transaction. However, this special voting requirement will not apply where the proposed transaction
has been approved in a prescribed manner by the EQT board or if certain other conditions, including the amount of consideration to be
paid to certain shareholders, are satisfied or the transaction involves certain subsidiaries. This voting requirement is in addition to any
other voting requirement under the PBCL, the EQT articles or the EQT bylaws.

        Under Subchapter 25E of the PBCL, if any person or group acting in concert acquires voting power over shares representing 20% or
more of the votes which all of EQT's shareholders would be entitled to cast in an election of directors, any other shareholder may demand
that such person or group purchase such shareholder's shares at a price determined in an appraisal proceeding.

        Under Subchapter 25F of the PBCL, EQT may not engage in a merger, consolidation, share exchange, division, asset sale, disposition
(in one transaction or a series of transactions) or a variety of other "business combination" transactions with a person which becomes the
"beneficial owner" of shares representing 20% or more of the voting power in an election of EQT's directors unless: (1) the business
combination or the acquisition of the 20% interest is approved by the EQT board prior to the date the 20% interest is acquired; (2) the
person beneficially owns at least 80% of EQT's outstanding shares and the business combination (a) is approved by a majority vote of the
disinterested shareholders and (b) satisfies certain minimum price and other conditions prescribed in Subchapter 25F; (3) the business
combination is approved by a majority vote of the disinterested shareholders at a meeting called no earlier than five years after the date the
20% interest is acquired; or (4) the business combination (a) is approved by shareholder vote at a meeting called no earlier than five years
after the date the 20% interest is acquired and (b) satisfies certain minimum price and other conditions prescribed in Subchapter 25F.

        EQT has elected to opt out of Subchapter 25G of the PBCL (which would have required a shareholder vote to accord voting rights to
control shares acquired by a 20% shareholder in a control-share acquisition) and Subchapter 25H of the PBCL (which would have required
a person or group to disgorge to EQT any profits received from a sale of EQT's equity securities under certain circumstances).

Advance Notice Requirements

        The EQT bylaws require EQT shareholders to provide advance notice if they wish to submit a proposal or nominate candidates for
director at EQT's annual meeting of shareholders. These procedures provide that notice of shareholder proposals and shareholder
nominations for the election of directors at EQT's annual meeting must be in writing and received by EQT's secretary at its principal
executive offices at least 90, but not more than 120, days prior to the anniversary of the date of the prior year's annual meeting of
shareholders. In the case of a shareholder nomination, the notice submitted to the secretary must set forth information about the nominee
and be accompanied by an original irrevocable conditional resignation in the event that such director, in an uncontested election, receives
more votes "against" than "for" the director's election.

Table of Contents

Special Meetings of Shareholders

        The EQT bylaws provide that a special meeting of shareholders may be called by the board of directors or by EQT's chief executive
officer. EQT shareholders do not have a right to call a special meeting under the current EQT bylaws or under the PBCL.

Special Treatment for Specified Groups of Nonconsenting Shareholders

        Additionally, the PBCL permits an amendment of a corporation's articles of incorporation or other corporate action, if approved by
shareholders generally, to provide mandatory special treatment for specified groups of nonconsenting shareholders of the same class by
providing, for example, that shares of common stock held only by designated shareholders of record, and no other shares of common
stock, shall be cashed out at a price determined by the corporation, subject to applicable dissenters' rights.

Exercise of Director Powers Generally

        The PBCL also provides that the directors of a corporation are not required to regard the interests of the shareholders as being
dominant or controlling in making decisions concerning takeovers or any other matters. The directors may consider, to the extent they
deem appropriate, among other things, (1) the effects of any proposed action upon any or all groups affected by the action, including,
among others, shareholders, employees, creditors, customers and suppliers, (2) the short-term and long-term interests of the corporation,
(3) the resources, intent and conduct of any person or group seeking to acquire control of the corporation and (4) all other pertinent factors.
The PBCL expressly provides that directors do not violate their fiduciary duties solely by relying on "poison pills" or the anti-takeover
provisions of the PBCL. EQT does not currently have a "poison pill."

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF EQT AND COMMON
STOCKHOLDERS OF RICE 

        EQT is incorporated in Pennsylvania and Rice is incorporated in Delaware. Your rights as a Rice stockholder are governed by the
DGCL, the Rice amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the "Rice certificate of incorporation"), and the Rice
amended and restated bylaws (the "Rice bylaws"). Upon completion of the merger, as an EQT shareholder your rights will be governed by
the PBCL, the EQT articles and the EQT bylaws. The following is a summary of the material differences between the rights of holders of
EQT common stock or preferred stock and the rights of holders of Rice common stock or Rice preferred stock, but does not purport to be a
complete description of those differences. These differences may be determined in full by reference to the PBCL, the DGCL, the EQT
articles, the Rice certificate of incorporation, the EQT bylaws and the Rice bylaws. The EQT articles, the Rice certificate of incorporation,
the EQT bylaws, and the Rice bylaws are subject to amendment in accordance with their terms. Copies of the governing corporate
instruments are available, without charge, to any person, including any beneficial owner to whom this document is delivered, by following
the instructions listed under "Where You Can Find More Information."

Rice  EQT
AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

Authorized Shares.    Rice is authorized under the Rice certificate
of incorporation to issue 650,000,000 shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share.

 Authorized Shares.    EQT is authorized under the EQT articles to
issue 320,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value, and
3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value.

Preferred Stock.    The Rice board has designated 40,000 shares of
its authorized preferred stock as Class A Preferred Stock. As of
September 21, 2017, 15,217 shares of its preferred stock were
issued and outstanding. In addition, the Rice certificate of
incorporation authorizes the Rice board to, without stockholder
approval, authorize the issuance of preferred stock from time to
time in one or more classes or series, and with respect to each
series of preferred stock, to fix and state by resolution the
designation and the powers, preferences, rights, qualifications,
limitations and restrictions relating to each series of preferred
stock.

 Preferred Stock.    Under the EQT articles, the EQT board may,
from time to time and without shareholder approval, establish and
cause EQT to issue one or more classes or series of preferred
stock and set the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights,
voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other
distributions, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption
of such classes or series.

DIVIDENDS

Under the Rice bylaws and in accordance with the DGCL, the
Rice board may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of its
capital stock either out of its surplus or, if there is no such surplus,
out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is
declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. However, the Rice board
cannot declare and pay dividends out of net profits if the capital of
the corporation is less than the aggregate amount of capital
represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes of
stock having a preference on the distribution of assets.

Under the Certificate of Designation of Class A Preferred Stock of
Rice, dated October 19, 2016, dividends shall not be declared or
paid on such shares.

 Under the PBCL, subject to restrictions in the bylaws of a
corporation, if any, the board of directors of the corporation may
authorize, and the corporation may make, distributions on the
shares of its capital stock. However, no distribution may be made
if it would result in the corporation becoming unable to pay its
debts as they become due in the usual course of business or if the
corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total
liabilities plus (unless the articles of incorporation provide
otherwise) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation
were dissolved, to satisfy the shareholders whose preferential
rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.

VOTING RIGHTS IN AN EXTRAORDINARY TRANSACTION

Under the DGCL and the Rice certificate of incorporation, an
amendment to the Rice certificate of incorporation requires (1) the
approval of the Rice board and (2) the affirmative vote of the

shares of stock of Rice entitled to vote thereon, voting together as
a single class.

 Under Section 321(c) of the PBCL, a plan of merger or
consolidation may be adopted if, among other conditions, it
receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all
shareholders entitled to vote thereon. Under Section 321(d) of the
PBCL, no shareholder vote is required for a merger where the
articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation are identical
to those of the corporation being merged, or for a merger of an
80%-owned subsidiary into the parent.

  The EQT articles require that 80% of the voting power of the then
outstanding shares of capital stock of EQT entitled to vote in an
annual election of directors, voting together as a single class, is
required for the approval or authorization of any Business
Combination (as defined in the EQT articles) involving a Related
Person (as defined in the EQT articles).

AMENDMENT TO THE CERTIFICATE/ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

Under the DGCL and the Rice certificate of incorporation, an
amendment to the Rice certificate of incorporation requires (1) the
approval of the Rice board and (2) the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 662/3% in voting power of the outstanding
shares of stock of Rice entitled to vote thereon, voting together as
a single class.

 Under the PBCL, an amendment to the articles of incorporation
can be proposed by adoption of a resolution by the EQT board. An
amendment must be submitted to a vote and approved by a
majority of the shareholders entitled to vote thereon and, if any
class or series of shares is entitled to vote thereon as a class, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in each such class
vote, except for amendments on matters specified in
Section 1914(c) of the PBCL that do not require shareholder
approval and for those matters specified to require a higher vote
under the EQT articles.

  Except as may be specifically provided to the contrary in any
provision in the EQT articles with respect to amendment or repeal
of such provision, the EQT articles cannot be amended and no
provision may be repealed by its shareholders without a vote of
the holders of not less than 80% of the voting power of the then
outstanding shares of EQT's capital stock entitled to vote in an
annual election of directors of EQT, voting together as a single
class, unless such amendment has been approved by two-thirds of
EQT's whole board of directors, in which event (unless otherwise
expressly provided in the EQT articles) the EQT articles may be
amended and any provision repealed by such shareholder approval
as may be specified by law.

Rice  EQT
AMENDMENT TO THE BYLAWS

Under the Rice certificate of incorporation, the Rice bylaws may
be amended, altered or repealed (1) by resolution adopted by a
majority of the directors present at any special or regular meeting
of the Rice board at which a quorum is present or (2) at any
regular or special meeting of the stockholders upon the affirmative
vote of at least 662/3% in voting power of the then-outstanding
shares of stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single
class.

The Rice board may adopt, amend or repeal the Rice bylaws
without any action on the part of the Rice stockholders, provided
that any bylaw adopted or amended by the Rice board, and any
powers thereby conferred, may be amended, altered or repealed by
the Rice stockholders.

The Rice bylaws may be adopted, altered, amended or repealed by
Rice stockholders holding not less than 662/3% in voting power of
the then-outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon,
voting together as a single class.

 The EQT board may make, amend and repeal the EQT bylaws
with respect to those matters which are not, by statute, reserved
exclusively to EQT's shareholders, subject to the power of EQT's
shareholders to change such action. No bylaw may be made,
amended or repealed by EQT's shareholders unless such action is
approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than
80% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of EQT's
capital stock entitled to vote in an annual election of directors,
voting together as a single class, unless such amendment has been
approved by two-thirds of EQT's whole board of directors, in
which event (unless otherwise expressly provided in the EQT
articles or the EQT bylaws) the EQT bylaws may be amended and
any provision may be repealed by such shareholder approval as
may be specified by law.

However, the EQT board may not adopt or change a bylaw on
certain subjects committed expressly to the shareholders by
Section 1504(b) of the PBCL.

APPRAISAL/DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

Under the DGCL, a stockholder of a Delaware corporation such as
Rice who has not voted in favor of, nor consented in writing to, a
merger or consolidation in which the corporation is participating
generally has the right to an appraisal of the fair value of the
stockholder's shares of stock, subject to specified procedural
requirements. The DGCL does not confer appraisal rights,
however, if the corporation's stock is either (1) listed on a national
securities exchange or (2) held of record by more than 2,000
holders.

 Under Section 1571(b) of the PBCL, dissenters' rights are not
generally conferred to shareholders in a merger if their shares are
(i) listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a
national market system security on an interdealer quotation
system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; or
(ii) held beneficially or of record by more than 2,000 persons.
Because EQT's shares are registered on the NYSE, a national
securities exchange, EQT shareholders would not have dissenters'
rights in such a transaction.

In such circumstances, appraisal rights can be restored if the
stockholder is required to accept as consideration in an applicable
transaction anything other than (1) stock of the surviving
corporation or resulting from the transaction or depository receipts
representing shares of the surviving or resulting corporation, or
those shares or depository receipts plus cash in lieu of fractional
interests, (2) stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts
representing shares of the other corporation, or those shares or
depository receipts plus cash in lieu of fractional interests, which
shares or depository receipts is or will be listed on a national
securities exchange or held by more than 2,000 stockholders, or
(3) any combination thereof.

 Under Sections 317 and 1517(c) of the PBCL, the bylaws or a
resolution of the board of directors may direct that all or part of
the shareholders shall have dissenters' rights in connection with
any corporation action or transaction that would not otherwise
entitle such shareholders to dissenters' rights. The EQT bylaws do
not provide for any additional dissenters' rights and EQT has not
adopted any resolution providing for additional dissenters' rights.

Rice  EQT
SPECIAL MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

Under the DGCL, special stockholder meetings of a corporation
may be called by the corporation's board of directors, or by any
person or persons authorized to do so by the corporation's
certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Under the Rice certificate
of incorporation, subject to the rights of holders of any series of
preferred stock, special meetings of Rice stockholders may be
called only by the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the
Rice board or the Rice board, pursuant to a resolution adopted by
the majority of the total number of directors that Rice would have
if there were no vacancies on the Rice board.

 Under Section 2521 of the PBCL, shareholders can call special
meetings if a registered corporation has adopted, after July 1,
2015, a provision permitting 25% or more of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote at a special meeting to call a special
meeting. The EQT articles do not contain a provision permitting
shareholders to call a special meeting.

Under the EQT bylaws, only the board of directors or the chief
executive officer may call special shareholder meetings.

SHAREHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Under the DGCL, any action that can be taken at any annual or
special meeting of stockholders of a corporation may also be
taken by stockholders without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote unless the certificate of incorporation provides
otherwise. Under the Rice certificate of incorporation, subject to
the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock, action
required or permitted to be taken by the Rice stockholders may
not be taken by any consent in writing of such stockholders.

 Section 1766 of the PBCL provides that, unless otherwise
restricted by a corporation's bylaws, any action required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders of the
corporation may be taken without a meeting by unanimous written
consent of the shareholders.

Section 2524 of the PBCL provides that an action may be
authorized by the shareholders of a registered corporation without
a meeting by less than unanimous consent only if permitted by its
articles.

Neither the EQT articles nor the EQT bylaws contain any
provisions altering action by written consent.

Rice  EQT

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS

The Rice bylaws generally permit stockholders to bring a proposal
or nomination before an annual or special meeting if the
nominating or proposing stockholder was a stockholder of record
at the time of giving of the notice required by the bylaws, is
entitled to vote at the meeting and has given to Rice's corporate
secretary timely written notice, in proper form, of the
stockholder's intention to bring that proposal or nomination before
the meeting.

Annual Meeting

To be timely delivered for an annual meeting, a stockholder's
notice must be delivered to Rice's corporate secretary at Rice's
principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than
120 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the date of the
preceding year's annual meeting. However, if the date of the
annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days
after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely
must be delivered not earlier than 120 days prior to the date of
such annual meeting and not later than the date that is later than
(1) 90 days prior to the 2018 annual meeting or, (2) if the first
public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less
than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the
10th day following the day on which public announcement of the
date of such meeting is first made by Rice.

 The EQT bylaws require EQT shareholders to provide advance
notice if they wish to submit a proposal or nominate candidates
for director at EQT's annual meeting of shareholders. These
procedures provide that notice of shareholder proposals and
shareholder nominations for the election of directors at EQT's
annual meeting must be in writing and received by EQT's
secretary at its principal executive offices at least 90, but not more
than 120, days prior to the anniversary of the date of the prior
year's annual meeting of shareholders. In the case of a shareholder
nomination, the notice submitted to the secretary must set forth
information about the nominee and be accompanied by an original
irrevocable conditional resignation in the event that such director,
in an uncontested election, receives more votes "against" than
"for" the director's election.

To be in proper form, a stockholder's notice must set forth certain
information:

(4)    With respect to each nominee for election or reelection to the
Rice board: a completed and signed questionnaire, representation
and agreement provided by Rice.

  

The Rice bylaws provide that this is the exclusive means for a
stockholder to make nominations or propose business at an annual
meeting of stockholders, other than business included in Rice's
proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

  

Special Meeting   

Nominations of persons for election to the Rice board may be
made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to
be elected pursuant to a notice of meeting, by any stockholder of
Rice who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice,
at the time of the special meeting is entitled to vote at the meeting,
and complies with the advance procedures required under the Rice
bylaws.

  

If a special meeting of stockholders is called for the purpose of
electing one or more directors to the Rice board, any such
stockholder may nominate one or more persons for election as
director to such position(s) as specified in Rice's notice of
meeting. Such stockholder's notice must comply with the notice
requirements summarized above under "—Annual Meeting" with
respect to any nomination and be delivered to Rice's corporate
secretary not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day
prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of
business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting
or, if the first public announcement of the date of such special
meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such special
meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public
announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and
of the nominees proposed by the Rice board to be elected at such
meeting.

  

Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of
stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting
pursuant to Rice's notice of meeting.

  

PROXY ACCESS FOR DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS

Neither the Rice certificate of incorporation nor the Rice bylaws
contain proxy access provisions.

 The EQT bylaws provide that when EQT solicits proxies with
respect to the election of directors at an annual meeting of
shareholders, subject to certain limitations, EQT shall include in
its proxy statement and proxy card for such annual meeting, in
addition to any persons nominated for election by the EQT board
or any committee thereof, the name and certain required
information of any person nominated for election to the EQT
board by a shareholder or group of no more than 20 shareholders
that satisfies certain requirements, and who expressly elects to
have its nominee included in EQT's proxy materials.

Rice  EQT
  The limitations and requirements include, among other things, a

maximum number of shareholder nominees that can be included
on the proxy statement (the greater of (x) two and (y) the largest
whole number that does not exceed 20% of the number of
directors in office as of the last day on which a valid proxy access
notice may be delivered to EQT), the nominating shareholder or
group of shareholders must have continually owned 3% or more
of the aggregate voting power of the EQT common stock for at
least 3 years, and the nominating shareholder or group of
shareholders must deliver a notice to EQT satisfying certain
timeliness and substantive criteria. To be timely, the notice must
be delivered to the principal executive offices of EQT not later
than the close of business on the 120th day nor earlier than the
close of business on the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of
the date that EQT mailed its proxy statement for the preceding
year's annual meeting of shareholders.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Number of Directors

Under the DGCL, the board of directors of a corporation must
consist of one or more members, each of whom must be a natural
person. The bylaws provide that the number of directors shall be
fixed from time to time exclusively pursuant to a resolution
adopted by a majority of the Rice board. Presently, the number of
directors is fixed at seven.

 The EQT board has eleven directors. The EQT articles provide
that the number of directors on the EQT board shall not be less
than five nor more than twelve. The EQT bylaws provide that the
number of directors is fixed only by resolution of the EQT board.

If the charter amendment proposal is not approved by EQT's
shareholders, it is expected that following the merger the EQT
board will have twelve directors. If the charter amendment
proposal is approved by the shareholders of EQT, the EQT articles
will provide that the number of directors on the EQT board shall
be not less than five nor more than thirteen and it is expected that
the EQT board will have thirteen directors.

Classified Board

The DGCL permits classified boards and the Rice certificate of
incorporation provides that directors of Rice, other than those who
may be elected by the holders of any series of preferred stock, will
be divided, with respect to the time for which they severally hold
office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number as is
reasonably possible, with each class serving three-year staggered
terms.

 The PBCL permits classified boards but EQT does not have a
classified board of directors.

Rice  EQT
Removal

The DGCL provides that directors serving on a classified board
may be removed only for cause by the holders of a majority of the
shares then entitled to vote in an election of directors. Under the
Rice certificate of incorporation, subject to the rights of the
holders of any preferred stock, any director may be removed only
for cause, upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
662/3% of the outstanding shares of Rice's stock entitled to vote
generally for the election of directors, acting at a meeting of the
stockholders.

 Under the EQT articles, a director may be removed with or
without cause by the affirmative vote of 80% of the votes which
all shareholders would be entitled to cast at an annual election of
directors.

In addition, under Section 1726(c) of the PBCL, a court may
remove a director upon application in a derivative suit in cases of
fraudulent or dishonest acts, gross abuse of authority or discretion,
or for any other proper cause. Section 1726(a)(4) of the PBCL
also provides that the board of directors may be removed at any
time with or without cause by the unanimous vote or written
consents of shareholders entitle to vote thereon.

Vacancies

Under the Rice certificate of incorporation, subject to the rights of
holders of preferred stock, any vacancies on the Rice board for
any reason and any newly created directorships resulting from an
increase in the number of directors may be filled only by the Rice
board, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number
of directors then in office. Any director elected to fill a vacancy
not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall
hold office for the remaining term of his or her predecessor.

 Vacancies in the board, including vacancies resulting from an
increase in the number of directors, may be filled by a majority of
the remaining directors though less than a quorum except that
vacancies resulting from removal from office by a vote of the
shareholders may be filled by the shareholders at the same
meeting at which such removal occurs. Any directors elected in
these circumstances will hold office for a term expiring at the next
annual meeting of shareholders held immediately following such
person being elected to fill the vacancy.

Special Meetings of the Board

Under the Rice bylaws, special meetings of the Rice board may be
called at the request of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief
Executive Officer or a majority of the Rice board then in office.

 Special meetings of the board of directors may be called by the
chief executive officer of EQT or by the EQT board.

Rice  EQT
Directors Liability and Indemnification

The DGCL provides that a corporation may indemnify a director
or officer against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by
such individual in association with any action, suit or proceeding
in which he or she is involved by reason of his or her service to
the corporation, if the director or officer acted in good faith and in
a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the corporation, and with respect to a
criminal proceeding, the director or officer had no reason to
believe that the act was unlawful.

Under the Rice bylaws, Rice must indemnify any person who is a
defendant or made a defendant in any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil or criminal,
administrative or investigative, if the person, or a person for
whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or
officer of Rice or, while a director or officer of Rice, is or was
serving at the request of Rice as a director, officer, trustee,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint
venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including
service with respect to an employee benefit plan, whether the
basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as
a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent, or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, trustee, employee or
agent, against all expenses, liability and loss (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes
and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred
or suffered by such person in connection with such proceeding.

The Rice bylaws provide that Rice will be required to indemnify
and advance expenses (including attorneys' fees) to such
indemnified persons to the fullest extent permitted by law. To the
extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in
advance of the final disposition of the proceeding are made only
upon receipt of an undertaking by the covered person to repay all
amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the
covered person is not entitled to indemnification under the Rice
certificate of incorporation or the Rice bylaws.

The DGCL permits a corporation to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of a corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and
incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of
such person's status as such.

 The PBCL permits a corporation to indemnify any person who
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an
action by or in the right of the corporation), by reason of the fact
that he is or was a representative of the corporation, against
expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by
him in connection with the action or proceeding if he acted in
good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not
opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and with respect
to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his
or her conduct was unlawful. In an action by or in the right of the
corporation, indemnification will not be made in respect of any
claim, issue, or matter as to which the person has been adjudged
to be liable to the corporation.

Unless ordered by a court, the determination of whether
indemnification is proper in a specific case will be determined by
(1) the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum
consisting of directors who were not parties to the action or
proceeding; (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable or if obtainable
and a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors so
directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or
(3) by the shareholders.

To the extent that a representative of a business corporation has
been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of a third-
party action, derivative action, or corporate action, he must be
indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually
and reasonably incurred by such individual in connection
therewith.

Pennsylvania law permits a corporation to purchase and maintain
insurance for a director or officer against any liability asserted
against such individual, and incurred in his or her capacity as a
director or officer or arising out of his or her position, whether or
not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such
individual against such liability under Pennsylvania law.

The EQT articles and bylaws provide that a director shall to the
maximum extent permitted by Pennsylvania law, have no personal
liability or monetary damages for any action taken, or any failure
to take any action as a director. The EQT articles and bylaws also
provide for indemnification for current and former directors,
officers, employees, or agents serving at the request of the
corporation to the fullest extent permitted by Pennsylvania law.
The EQT bylaws also permit the advancement of expenses.

Table of Contents

Rice  EQT
The DGCL permits corporations to include provisions in their
certificate of incorporation eliminating monetary damages for a
director for any breach of fiduciary duty. A corporation may not
eliminate liability for a director's breach of the duty of loyalty to
the corporation or its stockholders, for acts or omissions not in
good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, for unlawful dividends, stock purchases or
redemptions, or for any transaction from which the director
derived an improper personal benefit. Under the Rice certificate of
incorporation, no director of Rice will be liable to Rice or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as
a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or
limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL.

  

RIGHTS PLAN

The DGCL does not include a statutory provision expressly
validating shareholder rights plans; however, such plans have
generally been upheld by decision of courts applying Delaware
law. Rice does not have a shareholder rights plan currently in
effect.

 While the PBCL authorizes a corporation to adopt a shareholder
rights plan, EQT does not have a shareholder rights plan currently
in effect.

Rice  EQT
STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER STATUTES

Business Combinations
The DGCL generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in a
"business combination" with an "interested stockholder"
(generally, one who beneficially owns 15% or more of the voting
power) for a period of three years following the date that the
stockholder became an "interested stockholder" unless:

• prior to that time the corporation's board of directors approved
either the business combination or the transaction that resulted
in the stockholder becoming an "interested stockholder";

• upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the
stockholder becoming an "interested stockholder," the
"interested stockholder" owned at least 85% of the voting stock
of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction
commenced, subject to specified adjustments; or

• at or subsequent to that time, the business combination is
approved by the corporation's board of directors and authorized
at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by the
affirmative vote of at least 662/3% of the outstanding voting
stock that is not owned by the "interested stockholder."

The three-year prohibition on business combinations with an
"interested stockholder" does not apply under certain
circumstances, including business combinations with a
corporation that does not have a class of voting stock that is:

• listed on a national security exchange; or

• held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders;

unless, in each case, this result was directly or indirectly caused
by the "interested stockholder" or from a transaction in which a
person became an "interested stockholder."

The term "business combination" is defined to include a wide
variety of transactions, including mergers, consolidations, sales or
other dispositions of 10% or more of a corporation's assets and
various other transactions that may benefit an "interested
stockholder."

Under the Rice certificate of incorporation, Rice has opted out of
this section of the DGCL.

 
Section 2538 of Subchapter 25D of the PBCL requires certain
transactions with an "interested shareholder" to be approved by a
majority of disinterested shareholders. "Interested shareholder" is
defined broadly to include any shareholder who is a party to the
transaction or who is treated differently than other shareholders
and affiliates of the corporation.

Subchapter 25E of the PBCL requires a person or group of
persons acting in concert which acquires 20% or more of the
voting shares of the corporation to offer to purchase the shares of
any other shareholder at "fair value." "Fair value" means the value
not less than the highest price paid by the controlling person or
group during the 90-day period prior to the control transaction,
plus a control premium. Among other exceptions, shares acquired
directly from the corporation in a transaction exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act, are not counted
towards the determination of whether the 20% share ownership
threshold has been met for purposes of Subchapter 25E.

Subchapter 25F of the PBCL generally establishes a 5-year
moratorium on a "business combination" with an "interested
shareholder." "Interested shareholder" is defined generally to be
any beneficial owner of 20% or more of the corporation's voting
stock. "Business combination" is defined broadly to include
mergers, consolidations, asset sales and certain self-dealing
transactions. Certain restrictions apply to business combination
following the 5-year period. Among other exceptions,
Subchapter 25F will be rendered inapplicable if the board of
directors approves the proposed business combination, or
approves the interested shareholder's acquisition of 20% of the
voting shares, in either case prior to the date on which the
shareholder first becomes an interested shareholder.

Subchapter 25G of the PBCL provides that "control shares" lose
voting rights unless such rights are restored by the affirmative
vote of a majority of (i) the disinterested shares (generally, shares
held by persons other than the acquiror, executive officers of the
corporation and certain employee stock plans) and (ii) the
outstanding voting shares of the corporation. "Control shares" are
defined as shares which, upon acquisition, will result in a person
or group acquiring for the first time voting control over (a) 20%,
(b) 331/3% or (c) 50% or more of the outstanding shares, together
with shares acquired within 180 days of attaining the applicable
threshold and shares purchased with the intention of attaining such
threshold. A corporation may redeem control shares if the
acquiring person does not request restoration of voting rights as
permitted by Subchapter 25G. Among other exceptions,
Subchapter 25G does not apply to a merger, consolidation or a
share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction
agreement.

Table of Contents

Rice  EQT
  Subchapter 25H of the PBCL provides that if any person or group

publicly discloses that the person or group may acquire control of
the corporation, or a person or group acquires, or publicly
discloses an offer or intent to acquire, 20% or more of the voting
power of the corporation and, in either case, sells shares in the
following 18 months, then the profits from such sale must be
disgorged to the corporation if the securities that were sold were
acquired during the 18-month period or within the preceding
24 months.

  If shareholders approve a control share acquisition under
Subchapter 25G, the corporation is also subject to Subchapters 25I
and 25J of the PBCL. Subchapter 25I provides for a minimum
severance payment to certain employees terminated within two
years of the approval. Subchapter 25J prohibits the abrogation of
certain labor contracts prior to their stated date of expiration.

  EQT has elected to opt out of Subchapter 25G and
Subchapter 25H of the PBCL.

DUTIES OF DIRECTORS

Under Delaware law, the standards of conduct for directors have
developed through Delaware court case law. Generally, directors
of Delaware corporations are subject to a duty of loyalty and a
duty of care. The duty of loyalty requires directors to refrain from
self-dealing and the duty of care requires directors in managing
the corporate affairs to use that level of care which ordinarily
careful and prudent persons would use in similar circumstances.
When directors act consistently with their duties of loyalty and
care, their decisions generally are presumed to be valid under the
business judgment rule.

 Under the PBCL, the standard of conduct for directors is governed
by statute. The PBCL requires that a director of a Pennsylvania
corporation perform his or her duties: (1) in good faith, (2) in a
manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of
the corporation, and (3) with such care, including reasonable
inquiry, skill and diligence, as a person of ordinary prudence
would use under similar circumstances.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS AND DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

Rice stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, provided they satisfy the special criteria and conditions
set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Rice common stock held by stockholders that do not vote for approval of the merger and make a
demand for appraisal in accordance with Delaware law will not be converted into EQT common stock, but will be converted into the right
to receive from the combined company consideration determined in accordance with Delaware law.

Under the PBCL, as well as the governing documents of EQT, the EQT shareholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights in connection
with the merger or the transactions contemplated by the merger.
