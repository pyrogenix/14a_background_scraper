Apigee Corporation
10 S. Almaden Boulevard, 16th Floor

San Jose, California 95113

October 11, 2016

To the Stockholders of Apigee Corporation:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) of Apigee Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (“Apigee”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) to be held on November 8, 2016, at 10:00 am, Pacific Time, at the Hotel
De Anza, located at 233 West Santa Clara Street, San Jose, California 95113. 

At the Special Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of
Merger (as it may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), dated September 7, 2016, by
and among Apigee, Google Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent” or “Google”), and Areopagus Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”).  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and
into Apigee (the “Merger”), and Apigee will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.  If the Merger is completed, you will be
entitled to receive $17.40 in cash, without interest and less any applicable taxes, for each share of common stock that you own (unless
you have properly exercised your appraisal rights), which represents a premium of: (1) approximately 21.5% over the closing price of
Apigee’s common stock on August 15, 2016, the last trading day prior to the publication of a media report that Apigee was considering
a sale; (2) approximately 37.0% over the average closing price of Apigee’s common stock over the thirty (30) day trading period as of
August 15, 2016, the last trading day prior to the publication of a media report that Apigee was considering a sale; (3) approximately
41.5% over the closing price of Apigee’s common stock on August 2, 2016, the last trading date prior to the commencement of an
unexplained run-up in the trading price of Apigee’s common stock; and (4) approximately 43.1% over the average closing price of
Apigee’s common stock over the thirty (30) day trading period as of August 2, 2016, the last trading date prior to the commencement
of an unexplained run-up in the trading price of Apigee’s common stock. 

The Board of Directors of Apigee (the “Board of Directors”) after considering the factors more fully described in the
enclosed proxy statement, has unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, are advisable; (2) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of Apigee and its stockholders; (3) approved the execution
and delivery of Merger Agreement, the performance by Apigee of its covenants and obligations thereunder and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; and (4) resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of Apigee adopt the Merger Agreement.  The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote
(1) “FOR” the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement; and (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. 

The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the Special Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the Merger.  A
copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement.  The proxy statement also describes the actions and
determinations of the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger.  We encourage
you to read the proxy statement and its annexes, including the Merger Agreement, carefully and in their entirety, as they contain
important information.  You may also obtain more information on Apigee from documents we file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission from time to time.

enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone.

your shares of common stock in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

TO BE HELD ON NOVEMBER 8, 2016

Notice is hereby given that a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) of Apigee Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (“Apigee”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) will be held on November 8, 2016, at 10:00 am, Pacific Time, at the
Hotel De Anza, located at 233 West Santa Clara Street, San Jose, California 95113, for the following purposes:

1. To consider and vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended,
supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), dated September 7, 2016, by and among Apigee, Google Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and Areopagus Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger
Sub”).  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Apigee (the “Merger”), and Apigee will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;

2. To consider and vote on any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting;
and

3. To transact any other business that may properly come before the Special Meeting or any adjournment, postponement or other
delay of the Special Meeting. 

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote as of the
close of business on the Record Date (as defined below) is required to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.  The affirmative vote
of a majority of the shares of common stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and
entitled to vote on the subject matter is required to approve the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting. 
The failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or
to vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt
the Merger Agreement, but will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal.  If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure
to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, but will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal.  Abstentions will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, but will not have any effect on the
adjournment proposal. 

Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 7, 2016 (the “Record Date”) are entitled to notice of the
Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting or any adjournment, postponement or other delay thereof.  A list of stockholders
entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available in our offices located at 10 S. Almaden Blvd., 16th Floor, San Jose, California
95113, during regular business hours for a period of at least ten (10) calendar days before the Special Meeting and at the place of the
Special Meeting during the meeting. 

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement; and (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT

WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL MEETING IN PERSON, WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO
SUBMIT YOUR PROXY AS PROMPTLY AS POSSIBLE (1) BY TELEPHONE; (2) THROUGH THE INTERNET; OR (3) BY
SIGNING AND DATING THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD AND RETURNING IT IN THE PREPAID REPLY ENVELOPE
PROVIDED.  You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting. 

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote
your shares of common stock in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other
nominee.  Your broker or other agent cannot vote on either of the proposals, including the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement, without your instructions. 

If you are a stockholder of record, voting in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will revoke any proxy that you previously

to vote in person at the Special Meeting. 

If you fail to (1) return your proxy card; (2) grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone; or (3) attend the
Special Meeting in person, your shares of common stock will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present
at the Special Meeting and, if a quorum is present, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt
the Merger Agreement but will have no effect on the other proposal.

into the accompanying proxy statement, carefully and in their entirety.  If you have any questions concerning the Merger, the Special
Meeting or the accompanying proxy statement, you would like additional copies of the accompanying proxy statement or you need

in cash, without interest and less any applicable taxes (the “Merger Consideration”) (except for any shares of Apigee common
stock (1) held by the Company as treasury stock, (2) owned by Google, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, or (3) held by a holder who has not voted in favor of approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) (clauses (1), (2) and (3) collectively, the
“excluded shares”), in each case immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), which shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor), and you will no longer own any shares
of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.  For more information, see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger Agreement—Effects of the Merger” and “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration,” beginning on pages 84 and 85,
respectively. 

After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any
rights as a stockholder (except that stockholders who properly and validly exercise and perfect, and do not validly withdraw or
subsequently lose, their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares of common
stock as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law, as described below under the caption
“The Merger—Appraisal Rights”). 

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger—
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 78) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares
of common stock in the Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of
common stock surrendered in the Merger. 

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the
Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States. 

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger,” beginning on page 78. 

Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to
the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws
or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. 

Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock Units

As a result of the Merger, the treatment of the Company’s equity awards that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be as follows:

Options

Each outstanding stock option to purchase shares of Apigee common stock (each, a “company option”) with an exercise price
greater than or equal to $17.40 per share will be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration. 

Except as provided above, each company option that is vested as of the Effective Time (including company options that vest
as a result of the Merger) and each company option held by a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of Apigee (the
“Board of Directors” or the “Board”) or a service provider who is not an active

product of (x) the excess of (1) $17.40 over (2) the per share exercise price of such vested company option multiplied by (y) the
total number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such vested company option. 

Except as provided above, each company option that is not a vested company option (an “unvested company option”) will be
assumed and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the excess of
(1) $17.40 over (2) the per share exercise price of such unvested company option multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of
common stock issuable upon the exercise of such unvested company option, with payment of such amounts, less applicable taxes,
to be made in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such unvested company option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, provided that such holder remains employed by or otherwise in service to Google, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective subsidiaries on each applicable vesting date, subject to the terms and conditions of the plan and any related agreements
containing the payment, vesting conditions and other terms by which such consideration is payable to grantees thereof (the
“unvested payment plan”).

Stock Awards of the Company,” beginning on page 85. 

Restricted Stock Units

Each outstanding restricted stock unit issued by the Company (each, a “restricted stock unit”) held by an individual who is an
active employee of the Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed and converted into a
Google restricted stock unit (a “GSU”) for that number of shares of Alphabet Class C Capital Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of common stock underlying such restricted stock units multiplied by
(y) the stock award exchange ratio (as described below).  Each such GSU will continue to have, and will continue to be subject to,
the same terms and conditions, including vesting terms and continued service requirements, as applied to the restricted stock unit
prior to the Effective Time. 

Each restricted stock unit held by an individual who is a former employee of the Company or its subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than a non-employee member of the Board of Directors or any consultant or independent
contractor to the Company or its subsidiaries) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest and less any applicable taxes, equal to the product of (x) $17.40 multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of common
stock subject to such award of restricted stock units. 

Each restricted stock unit held by (1) a person other than an individual described in the foregoing two paragraphs or (2) any
non-employee member of the Board of Directors or any consultant or independent contractor to the Company or its subsidiaries
will vest and be settled in shares of common stock and each such share will be cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

Stock Awards of the Company,” beginning on page 85. 

Treatment of Purchase Rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan

All outstanding purchase rights under the Company’s 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) will automatically be
exercised upon the earlier of (1) a date prior to the Effective Time (but not later than 10 business days before the Effective Time)
and (2) the purchase date of the current purchase period in progress as of September 7, 2016, and the ESPP will terminate as of the
Effective Time.  No new purchase periods will begin under the ESPP on or after September 7, 2016, and ESPP participants will not

make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or after September 7, 2016.  All shares of common stock purchased under
the ESPP and held by an individual as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled at the Effective Time and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.  For more information, see the sections of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger—Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Purchase Rights
under the ESPP” and “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—ESPP,” beginning on pages 60 and 86, respectively. 

Treatment of Warrant

Any warrant that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, with an applicable exercise price per share that
is less than the Merger Consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of Google,
Merger Sub, Apigee or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into, and shall become a right to receive, such number of
shares as calculated in accordance with its terms and such shares (if any) issued or issuable as a result of such deemed exercise of
the warrant shall be deemed to be shares of Apigee common stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time which shares at the Effective Time will be canceled, extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, any warrant with an
applicable exercise price per share that is equal to or exceeds the Merger Consideration shall be immediately cancelled at the
Effective Time without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.  The cancellation or substitution, as
applicable, of a warrant as provided in the Merger Agreement shall be deemed the termination, and satisfaction in full of, any and
all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of such warrant.  For more information, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—Warrant,” beginning on page 86. 

Conditions to the Closing of the Merger

The respective obligations of Apigee, Google and Merger Sub to complete the closing of the Merger are subject to the
fulfillment of certain conditions, on or prior to the date upon which the closing of the Merger will actually occur (the “Closing
Date”), any one or more of which may be waived (where permitted by applicable law) prior to the Effective Time by Apigee or
Google (as applicable) in writing, which conditions include (among others), the following:

•  (1) all waiting periods (and extensions thereof) applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act have expired or been

terminated; and (2) all antitrust, competition and merger control consents in Austria and Germany have been received

(2) any order issued or granted (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent), in each case, by a governmental
authority of competent jurisdiction that is in effect and has the effect of making the Merger illegal or which has the effect
of prohibiting the consummation of the Merger;

 

 
•  since the date of the Merger Agreement, there not having occurred or arisen any Company Material Adverse Effect that

is continuing;
 

 

•  the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Apigee, Parent and Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement, subject,
in some cases, to materiality qualifiers (generally other than as would not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect
or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable), as of the date of the Merger Agreement and/or as of the Effective Time

applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act have expired or been terminated; and (2) all antitrust, competition and merger control
consents in Austria and Germany has been received (or been deemed to have been received by virtue of the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period).  For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,” beginning on page 81. 

Recommendation of the Board of Directors

The Board of Directors, after considering various factors described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” beginning on page 44, has unanimously
(1) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable;
(2) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the
best interests of Apigee and its stockholders; (3) approved the execution and delivery of Merger Agreement, the performance by
Apigee of its covenants and obligations thereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger; and (4) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Apigee adopt the Merger Agreement.  The Board of Directors
unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement; and (2) “FOR” the
adjournment of the special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”), if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of September 7, 2016, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations upon the scope of review undertaken by Morgan
Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Apigee common stock (other
than the excluded shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. 

The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley to the Board of Directors, dated as of September 7, 2016, which

implications of the Merger or related transactions.  Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute
advice or a recommendation as to how the stockholders should vote at any stockholders’ meeting that may be held in
connection with the Merger or whether the stockholders should take any other action in connection with the Merger. 

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Opinion of the Company’s Financial
Advisor,” beginning on page 48. 

Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to approve and adopt
the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are
different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder.  In (1) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement;
(2) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (3) recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by
stockholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among
other matters.  These interests include the following:
 

 •  continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the Surviving Corporation;
 

 •  accelerated vesting of certain equity awards;
 

 •  termination of certain equity awards in exchange for cash;
 

 
•  conversion of certain equity awards into the right to receive cash following the Merger, subject to continued employment

or service;
 

 •  the entitlement to receive certain cash payments in connection with the Merger;
 

 
•  the anticipated continued employment of certain officers of Apigee by Google or the Surviving Corporation following

the Effective Time;
 

 
•  the entitlement to receive certain severance benefits upon specified qualifying terminations under arrangements with the

Company; and
 

 
•  the entitlement to receive cash and equity, and the entitlement to receive certain severance benefits upon specified

qualifying terminations, under new offer letters with Google. 

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Apigee’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 60. 

Appraisal Rights

If the Merger is consummated, Apigee stockholders who do not vote their shares of common stock in favor of the approval
and adoption of the Merger Agreement, who continuously hold such shares of common stock through the Effective Time, who
properly perfect appraisal of their shares of common stock and who meet certain other conditions (including relating to the amount
of stock ownership) will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.  This means
that such stockholders are entitled to have their shares of common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to
receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as
determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL).  Due to

the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of common stock are encouraged to
seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. 

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of common stock as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would
receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of common stock. 

To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of record must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to Apigee
before the vote is taken on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement; (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise
vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement; and (3) continue to hold the subject shares of
common stock through the Effective Time of the Merger.  The failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the
DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights.  In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal
proceedings in respect of Apigee unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the stockholders seeking
appraisal, as described further below.  The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further
detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is attached as Annex C to
this proxy statement.  If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to
exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate
procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee. 

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights,” beginning on page
73. 

Alternative Acquisition Proposals

Under the Merger Agreement, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the
Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, Apigee has agreed not to, and to cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective
directors, officers, employees, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants, agents and other authorized representatives
(collectively, the “representatives”), not to, among other things: (1) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, knowingly facilitate or
knowingly induce the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction (as such terms are defined under “The Merger Agreement—Alternative
Acquisition Proposals”); (2) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information
to any person or entity relating to Apigee or any of its subsidiaries in connection with or that would reasonably be expected to lead
to, an acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction; or (3) take any action to make the provisions of any takeover statute
(including any transaction under, or a third party becoming an “interested stockholder” under, Section 203 of the DGCL), or any
restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws, inapplicable to any
person or entity other than Google and its affiliates or to any transactions constituting or contemplated by an acquisition proposal. 

Notwithstanding these restrictions, under certain circumstances, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Apigee
stockholders, Apigee may provide information to, and engage or participate in negotiations or discussions with, a person or entity
regarding a written acquisition proposal that was not solicited in violation of the restrictions set forth in the Merger Agreement if
the Board of Directors (1) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such
acquisition proposal either constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal (as defined under “The Merger
Agreement—Alternative Acquisition Proposals”) and (2) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and at the time of taking
such action, such acquisition proposal constitutes or continues to be reasonably likely to

Alternative Acquisition Proposals,” beginning on page 93. 

Apigee is not entitled to (1) effect a company board recommendation change, prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder
approval, in respect of (A) an acquisition transaction the Board has determined is a superior proposal or (B) in connection with an
intervening event that was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Board as of or prior to September 7, 2016 and which first
became known or reasonably foreseeable prior to the receipt of the requisite stockholder approval (or if known, the magnitude or
material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Board as of September 7, 2016 and which first
became known or reasonably foreseeable prior to the receipt of the requisite stockholder approval) and does not relate to an
acquisition proposal or (2) terminate the Merger Agreement, prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, to enter into an
agreement for a superior proposal unless, in each case, it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including
negotiating with Parent over a four (4) business day period (as such may be extended) so that such proposal ceases to be a superior
proposal or such that the Board no longer determines in good faith that the failure to effect a company board recommendation
change in response to an intervening event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.  The termination of
the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including by (1) Apigee in order to accept a superior proposal or (2) Parent
if the Board shall have effected a company board recommendation change, will result in the payment by Apigee of a $21,750,000
termination fee to Parent.  For more information, see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—The
Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination of
the Merger Agreement,” on pages 96 and 104, respectively. 

Termination of the Merger Agreement

The Merger Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after receipt of the requisite stockholder approval (except as provided in the Merger Agreement), only as follows:
 

 •  by mutual written agreement of Apigee and Google;
 

 •  by either Apigee or Google if:
 

 

•  the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before the first business day after March 7, 2017, (the

shall not have been satisfied or duly waived (where permitted by applicable law) by all parties entitled to the
benefit of such condition by the fifth (5th) business day prior to March 7, 2017, either Google or Apigee may, by
written notice delivered to the other party, extend the termination date to June 7, 2017, and if the conditions set
forth in the second and third bullet points in the Conditions to Closing the Merger section above (as a result of an
order or applicable law under antitrust laws) have not been satisfied or duly waived by all parties entitled to the
benefit of such condition by the fifth (5th) business day prior to June 7, 2017, either Google or Apigee may, by
written notice delivered to the other party, extend the termination date to September 7, 2017; provided, however
that the right to terminate the Merger Agreement as a result of the occurrence of the termination date will not be
available to any party whose action or failure to act (which action or failure to act constitutes a breach by such
party under the Merger Agreement) has been a principal cause or resulted in the failure of the closing of the
Merger to have occurred on or before such termination date, as the same may be extended);

prior to effecting any change of recommendation. 

In the event that the Merger Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to the termination rights above, the Merger Agreement
will be of no further force or effect without liability of any party thereto (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or representative of such party or parties) to the other party or parties thereto, as applicable, except (1) the terms of
certain sections of the Merger Agreement will survive the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with their respective
terms, including terms relating to confidentiality, public disclosure, notice and payment of the applicable termination fees, and
(2) that nothing in the Merger Agreement will relieve any party thereto from liability for any willful and intentional breach of the
Merger Agreement prior to such termination, or any fraud committed in connection with the Merger Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated thereby.  In addition, no termination of the Merger Agreement will affect the obligations of any party
pursuant to the confidentiality agreement between Google and Apigee, which obligations will survive the termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.  For more information, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement,” beginning on page 104. 

Termination Fees

Whether or not the Merger is completed, Apigee, on the one hand, and Google and Merger Sub, on the other hand, are each
responsible for all of their respective costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

Apigee will be required to pay to Google a termination fee of $21,750,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated (or at the
time of termination by Apigee, could have been terminated by Google) under the circumstances specified in the section captioned
“The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees—Termination Fee Payable by Apigee.”  In no event will Apigee be required to pay
the company termination fee in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement more than once.  Apigee, Google and
Merger Sub have agreed that the payment of the company termination fee, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement,
to Google will be Google’s sole and exclusive remedy for any loss it or Merger Sub suffers as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be consummated, except that there is no limit to liability for any losses
resulting from a willful and intentional breach of the Merger Agreement prior to its termination, or any fraud committed in

more than once.  Apigee, Google and Merger Sub have agreed that the payment of the parent termination fee, in accordance with
the terms of the Merger Agreement, to Apigee will be Apigee’s sole and exclusive remedy for any loss it suffers as a result of the
failure of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be consummated, except that there is no limit to liability for
any losses resulting from a willful and intentional breach of the Merger Agreement prior to its termination, or any fraud committed
in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. 

For more information on these termination fees, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—
Termination Fees” beginning on page 106. 

The Special Meeting

Date, Time and Place

The Special Meeting will be held on November 8, 2016, at 10:00 am, Pacific Time, at Hotel De Anza, located at 233 West
Santa Clara Street, San Jose, California 95113, unless the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed. 

Record Date; Shares of Common Stock Entitled to Vote

You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of common stock at the close of business on October 7,
2016 (the “Record Date”).  You will have one vote at the Special Meeting for each share of common stock that you owned at the
close of business on the Record Date. 

Purpose

At the Special Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to (1) approve and adopt the Merger Agreement; and
(2) adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and
adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. 

Quorum

As of the Record Date, there were 30,910,251 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting.  The holders of a majority of the shares of common stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote as of the close of
business on the Record Date, and present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. 

Required Vote

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote as of
the close of business on the Record Date is required to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.  If a quorum is present, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the
Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter will have the power to adjourn the Special Meeting.  If a quorum is not
present, then either the chairperson of the meeting or the stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, present in person or
represented by proxy, will have the power to adjourn the Special Meeting.  The chairperson of the meeting shall have the authority
to adjourn the Special Meeting in all other events.

Share Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
11,393,548 shares of common stock, representing approximately 36.9% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the Record
Date. 

Chet Kapoor, our chief executive officer; certain affiliates of Mr.  Kapoor; Tim Wan, our chief financial officer; Stacey
Giamalis, our chief counsel; Anant Jhingran, our chief technology officer; Shankar Ramaswamy, our vice president of engineering
and operations; entities affiliated with Bay Partners and Neal Dempsey, a member of the Board of Directors; entities affiliated with
Norwest Venture Partners and Promod Haque, a member of the Board of Directors; and entities affiliated with Third Point Partners
and Robert Schwartz a member of the Board of Directors, each entered into a voting agreement with Parent.  Each voting
agreement obligates such party to, among other things, vote their shares of common stock in favor of the proposal to approve and
adopt the Merger Agreement, unless the Board of Directors has effected a company board recommendation change, which would
require each party, together with all other parties to such voting agreements, to collectively vote an aggregate number of shares of
common stock equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of the total voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company as of
the record date for such meeting, and the total number of shares of common stock in excess of such percentage (determined on a
pro rata basis among all persons who have executed voting agreements) would no longer be subject to the voting requirements of
the voting agreements, and such stockholders would be entitled to cast such excess shares of common stock in any manner such
party chooses.  As of the close of business on the Record Date, Apigee stockholders subject to voting agreements collectively have
voting power over approximately 47% of the outstanding shares of Apigee common stock.  For more information, see the section
of this proxy statement captioned “The Voting Agreements.”

Voting and Proxies

Any stockholder of record entitled to vote may submit a proxy by returning a signed proxy card by mail in the accompanying
prepaid reply envelope or granting a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, or may vote in person by appearing at
the Special Meeting.  If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of common stock in “street name” through a bank, broker
or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of common stock
using the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.  Under NASDAQ rules, banks, brokers or other nominees
have the discretion to vote on routine matters.  The proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting are non-routine matters, and
banks, brokers and other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions.  Therefore, it is important that you
cast your vote or instruct your bank, broker or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of common stock. 

If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special
Meeting by (1) signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it prior to the Special Meeting; (2) submitting a new
proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy; (3) delivering a written notice of
revocation to our Secretary; or (4) attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot. 

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote.  You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy”
from your bank, broker or other nominee. 

Effect on Apigee if the Merger is Not Completed

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by the Apigee stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, the
Apigee stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock.

Instead, Apigee will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ
and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and we will continue to file periodic
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).  Under specified circumstances, Apigee will be required to pay
Parent a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement; and under different specified circumstances, Parent will be
required to pay Apigee a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, in each case, without limiting the ability
of any party to collect any losses resulting from a willful and intentional breach of the Merger Agreement prior to its termination,
or any fraud committed in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.  For more details see

A: Stockholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at
the Special Meeting.  Each holder of shares of common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before
the Special Meeting for each share of common stock owned as of the close of business on the Record Date.

Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure that your shares of common stock will be represented at the
Special Meeting we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope
or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone.  If you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by
ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted. 

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares of
common stock in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. 
Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger

Table of Contents

Q: What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Apigee?
 

A: The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Apigee by Google.  If the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement is
approved by stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger
Sub will merge with and into Apigee, with Apigee continuing as the Surviving Corporation.  As a result of the Merger, Apigee
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Google, and our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted
from NASDAQ.  In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic
reports with the SEC. 

 
Q: What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
 

A: Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each issued and outstanding share of
common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost your appraisal
rights under the DGCL and certain other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied.  For example, if you own one hundred
(100) shares of common stock, you will be entitled to receive $1,740.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock,
without interest and less any applicable taxes. 

 
Q: How does the Merger Consideration compare to the unaffected market price of the common stock?
 

A: The Merger Consideration of $17.40 constituted a premium of: (1) approximately 21.5% over the closing price of Apigee’s
common stock on August 15, 2016, the last trading day prior to the publication of a media report that Apigee was considering a
sale; (2) approximately 37.0% over the average closing price of Apigee’s common stock over the thirty (30) day trading period as
of August 15, 2016, the last trading day prior to the publication of a media report that Apigee was considering a sale;
(3) approximately 41.5% over the closing price of Apigee’s common stock on August 2, 2016, the last trading date prior to the
commencement of an unexplained run-up in the trading price of Apigee’s common stock; and (4) approximately 43.1% over the
average closing price of Apigee’s common stock over the thirty (30) day trading period as of August 2, 2016, the last trading date
prior to the commencement of an unexplained run-up in the trading price of Apigee’s common stock. 

 
Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?
 

A: If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”), the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount
equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the Merger. 

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the
Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the U.S.

Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal
income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under
U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.  A more complete description of
material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided under the caption “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

Table of Contents

Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer to in this
proxy statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the
enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone, so that your shares of common stock can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek appraisal.  If you
hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee to vote your shares of common stock.  Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. 

 
Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?
 

A: No.  After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and instructions for how to send your stock certificates
or surrender your book-entry shares of common stock to the payment agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for
the shares of common stock represented by your stock certificates.  Unless you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of
transmittal to exchange your stock certificates or book-entry shares of common stock for the cash payment to which you are
entitled.  Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. 

 
Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the Special

Meeting?
 

A: The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be
completed.  If you sell or transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless
special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer
your shares of common stock and each of you notifies Apigee in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of
common stock, but you will retain your right to vote those shares of common stock at the Special Meeting.  Even if you sell or
otherwise transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed
proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone. 

 
Q: How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?
 

A: The Board of Directors, after considering the various factors described under the caption “The Merger—Recommendation of the
Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable; (2) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of Apigee and its stockholders; (3) approved the
execution and delivery of Merger Agreement, the performance by Apigee of its covenants and obligations thereunder and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; and (4) resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger Agreement. 

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement;
and (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. 

 
Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?
 

A: If the Merger Agreement is not approved and adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock.  Instead, Apigee will remain an independent public
company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act, and we
will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.

Under specified circumstances, Apigee will be required to pay Parent a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement; and under different specified circumstances, Parent will be required to pay Apigee a termination fee upon the
termination of the Merger Agreement, in each case, without limiting the ability of any party to collect any losses resulting from a
willful and intentional breach of the Merger Agreement prior to its termination, or any fraud committed in connection with the
Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. For more details see the sections of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees” and “The Merger—Effect on Apigee if the Merger is Not Completed” beginning on
pages 106 and 33, respectively.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement?
 

A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote as of the
close of business on the Record Date is required to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. 

If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant
a proxy over the Internet or by telephone; or (3) vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.  If you hold your shares of common stock in “street
name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your
shares of common stock will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement.  If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. 

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares of common stock that you own. We cannot complete the
Merger unless the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit

additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special
Meeting?

 

A: If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter will have the power to adjourn the Special
Meeting.  If a quorum is not present, then either the chairperson of the meeting or the stockholders entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, will have the power to adjourn the Special Meeting.  The chairperson of the
meeting shall have the authority to adjourn the Special Meeting in all other events. 

The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone; or
(3) vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal.  If you hold your shares
of common stock in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares of common
stock will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal.  Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
adjournment proposal. 

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares of common stock that you own. We cannot complete the
Merger unless the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.

Q: What is the difference between holding shares of common stock as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
 

A: If your shares of common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares of common stock, to be the “stockholder of record.”  In this case,
this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Apigee. 

If your shares of common stock are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of
shares of common stock held in “street name.”  In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker
or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares of common stock, to be the stockholder of record.  As the
beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares of common stock by
following their instructions for voting.  You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting.  However, because you are not the
stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares of common stock in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal
proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee. 

 
Q: How may I vote?
 

A: If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered in your name with American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:

 

 •  by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
 

 •  by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;
 

 •  by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or
 

 •  by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot. 

A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of common
stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by
telephone.  Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares of common stock, if you vote electronically
over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be
responsible. 

Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of common stock by
proxy.  If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares of common stock that you beneficially own, you
may still vote your shares of common stock in person by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by
proxy.  If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted. 

If your shares of common stock are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your
bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if
such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone.  To vote over
the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form
provided by your bank, broker or nominee. 

 
Q: If my broker holds my shares of common stock in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares of common stock for me?
 

A: No.  Your bank, broker or other nominee is not permitted to vote your shares of common stock on any proposal currently
scheduled to be considered at the Special Meeting.  Your bank, broker or other nominee will only vote your shares of common
stock on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special Meeting if you instruct your bank, broker or other
nominee how to vote.  You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote of your shares of
common stock.  Without instructions,

your shares of common stock will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted against the
approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the adjournment proposal. 

 
Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?
 

A: Yes.  If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the
Special Meeting by:

 

 •  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 

 •  delivering a written notice of revocation to the Secretary; or
 

 •  attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot. 

Please note, however, that only your latest-dated proxy will count.  If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,”
you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote.  You may also vote in
person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee. 

 
Q: What is a proxy?
 

A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of common stock.  The written
document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.”  The
document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a “proxy card.”  Chet Kapoor, our Chief
Executive Officer, Tim Wan, our Chief Financial Officer and Stacey Giamalis, our chief counsel, each with the power to act
without the other and with full power of substitution, are the proxy holders for the Special Meeting. 

 
Q: If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of common stock voted?
 

A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares of common stock in the way that you
indicate.  When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares of common
stock should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before
the Special Meeting. 

If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares of common stock should be voted on a
matter, the shares of common stock represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (1) “FOR” the approval and
adoption of the Merger Agreement; and (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. 

 
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

A: Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone for) each proxy card and voting
instruction card that you receive. 

You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy
cards or voting instruction cards.  For example, if you hold your shares of common stock in more than one brokerage account,
you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares of common stock.  If you
are a stockholder of record and your shares of common stock are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than
one proxy card. 

 
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
 

A: If available, Apigee may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting.  Apigee intends to publish
final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC

following the Special Meeting.  All reports that Apigee files with the SEC are publicly available when filed.  See the section of
this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”

 
Q: What will the holders of Apigee company options and restricted stock units receive in the Merger?
 

A: Each outstanding company option with an exercise price greater than or equal to $17.40 per share will be cancelled at the
Effective Time for no consideration. 

Except as provided above, each vested company option will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest and less any applicable taxes, equal to the product of (x) the excess of (1) $17.40 over (2) the per share
exercise price of such vested company option multiplied by (y) the total number of shares issuable upon the exercise of such
vested company option. 

Except as provided above, each unvested company option will be assumed and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the excess of (1) $17.40 over (2) the per share exercise price of such unvested
company option multiplied by (y) the total number of shares issuable upon the exercise of such unvested company option, with
payment of such amounts, less applicable taxes, to be made in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such unvested
company option immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that such holder remains employed by or otherwise in service
to Google, the Surviving Corporation or their respective subsidiaries on each applicable vesting date, subject to the terms and
conditions of the unvested payment plan. 

Each outstanding restricted stock unit held by an individual who is an active employee of the Company or its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed and converted into a Google restricted stock unit (a “GSU”) for that
number of shares of Alphabet Class C Capital Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of common stock underlying such restricted stock units multiplied by (y) the stock award exchange ratio.  Each
such GSU will continue to have, and will continue to be subject to, the same terms and conditions, including vesting terms and
continued service requirements, as applied to the restricted stock unit prior to the Effective Time. 

Each restricted stock unit held by an individual who is a former employee of the Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than a non-employee member of the Board of Directors or any consultant or independent contractor to
the Company or its subsidiaries) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and
less any applicable taxes, equal to the product of (x) $17.40 multiplied by (y) the total number of shares subject to such award of
restricted stock units. 

Each restricted stock unit held by (1) a person other than an individual described in the foregoing two paragraphs or (2) any non-
employee member of the Board of Directors or any consultant or independent contractor to the Company or its subsidiaries will
vest and be settled in shares of common stock and each such share will be cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

Q: What will happen to the ESPP?
 

A: All outstanding purchase rights under the ESPP will automatically be exercised upon the earlier of (1) a date prior to the Effective
Time (but not later than 10 business days before the Effective Time) and (2) the purchase date of the current purchase period in
progress as of September 7, 2016, and the ESPP will terminate as of the Effective Time.  No new purchase periods will begin
under the ESPP on or after September 7, 2016, and ESPP participants will not be permitted to increase the rate of payroll
contributions or make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or after September 7, 2016.  All shares of common stock
purchased under the ESPP and held by an individual as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled at the
Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
 

A: We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger by the end of
2016.  However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing
conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, many of which are outside of our control. 

 
Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
 

A: If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and who
properly demand appraisal of their shares of common stock will be entitled, provided certain other conditions (including relating
to the amount of shares of common stock owned by stockholders seeking appraisal) are met, to appraisal rights in connection with
the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.  This means that holders of shares of common stock are entitled to have their shares
of common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of
common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with
interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest
payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the
DGCL).  Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of common stock are in any case encouraged to seek the advice
of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process.  The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of
the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement. 

 
Q: Do any of Apigee’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of Apigee’s stockholders

generally?
 

A: Yes.  In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from,
or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally.  In (1) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (2) approving
the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (3) recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders, the Board
of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters.  For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive
Officers of Apigee in the Merger.”

 
Q: Who can help answer my questions?
 

A: If you have any questions concerning the Merger, the Special Meeting or this proxy statement, would like additional copies of this
proxy statement or need help voting your shares of common stock, please contact our Proxy Solicitor:

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement, the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement and information included in oral statements or
other written statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain “forward-looking statements” that do not directly or
exclusively relate to historical facts.  You can typically identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words, such
as “may,” “should,” “could,” “project,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “potential,” “plan,” “forecast” and
other words of similar import.  Stockholders are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward-
looking statements.  These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in our filings with the SEC,
including in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement, and the following factors:
 

 
•  the inability to complete the Merger due to the failure to obtain stockholder approval or failure to satisfy the other conditions

to the completion of the Merger, including receipt of required regulatory approvals;
 

 
•  the risk that the Merger Agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay Parent a termination fee of

$21,750,000;
 

 •  the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and others related to the Merger Agreement;
 

 •  risks that the proposed Merger disrupts our current operations or affects our ability to retain or recruit key employees;
 

 
•  the fact that receipt of the all-cash Merger Consideration will be taxable to stockholders that are treated as U.S. holders for

U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 
•  the fact that, if the Merger is completed, stockholders will forgo the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of

the successful execution of Apigee’s current strategy as an independent company;
 

 
•  the possibility that Parent could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including restructuring efforts, special

dividends or the sale of some or all of Apigee’s assets to one or more as yet unknown purchasers, that could conceivably
produce a higher aggregate value than that available to stockholders in the Merger;

 

 
•  the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Apigee is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals during the

pendency of the Merger;
 

 
•  the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on our business relationships, operating results and business

generally;
 

 
•  the inability to make certain changes to our business pending the completion of the Merger, and other restrictions on our

ability to conduct our business;
 

 
•  potential uncertainty in the marketplace, which could lead current and prospective customers to purchase from other vendors

or delay purchasing from us;
 

 •  the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger;
 

 
•  other developments beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in domestic or global economic conditions

that may affect the timing or success of the Merger;
 

 •  risks related to the Merger diverting management’s or employees’ attention from ongoing business operations;
 

 •  risks that our stock price may decline significantly if the Merger is not completed; and

•  risks related to obtaining the requisite consents to the Merger, including the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals from

various domestic and foreign governmental entities (including any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed on these
approvals) and the risk that one or more governmental entities may deny approval. 

Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this proxy statement are qualified by the information

to vary materially from the forward-looking statements. 

Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Stockholders are advised to consult any future disclosures that we make on
related subjects as may be detailed in our other filings made from time to time with the SEC.

THE SPECIAL MEETING

The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors for use at the Special Meeting. 

Date, Time and Place

We will hold the Special Meeting on November 8, 2016, at 10:00 am, Pacific Time, at Hotel De Anza, located at 233 West Santa
Clara Street, San Jose, California 95113, unless the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed. 

Attendance at the Special Meeting is limited to individuals who were stockholders as of the Record Date and admission will be on
a first-come, first-served basis.  Registration and seating will begin at 9:45 am, Pacific Time.  Each stockholder will be asked to present
proof of identification, such as a driver’s license or passport, prior to admission to the Special Meeting.  Cameras, recording devices
and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the Special Meeting. 

If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Special Meeting by requesting a ballot when you arrive.  You
may be requested to provide proof of stock ownership as of the Record Date.  If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street
name and wish to vote in person at the Special Meeting, you must bring proof of share ownership as of the Record Date (such as a bank
or brokerage firm account statement or a letter from the bank, broker or other nominee holding your shares) and obtain a “legal proxy”
from the bank, broker or other nominee that holds your shares.  A legal proxy is a written document that will authorize you to vote your
shares held in street name at the Special Meeting.  Please contact the bank, broker or other nominee that holds your shares for
instructions regarding obtaining a legal proxy. 

Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the Special Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to (1) approve and adopt the Merger Agreement; and
(2) adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. 

Record Date; Shares of Common Stock Entitled to Vote; Quorum

Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to
vote at the Special Meeting or at any adjournments or postponements thereof.  A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting will be available at our principal executive offices, located at 10 S. Almaden Blvd., 16th Floor, San Jose, California 95113,
during regular business hours for a period of no less than ten (10) calendar days before the Special Meeting and at the place of the
Special Meeting during the meeting. 

As of the Record Date, there were 30,910,251 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting. 

The holders of a majority of the shares of common stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote as of the close of business on the
Record Date, and present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting.  Once a share is
represented at the Special Meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the Special Meeting.  However, if a
new record date is set for an adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established.  Broker non-votes, described
below under the sub-heading “ –Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes,” will not be included in the calculation of the
number of shares considered to be present at the Special Meeting.  Abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of
shares considered to be present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.

Table of Contents

Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

Each share of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the Record Date is entitled to one vote on each of the
proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting. 

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote as of the
close of business on the Record Date is required to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.  Approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement by stockholders is a condition to the closing of the Merger. 

If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter will have the power to adjourn the Special
Meeting.  If a quorum is not present, then either the chairperson of the meeting or the stockholders entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, will have the power to adjourn the Special Meeting.  The chairperson of the
meeting shall have the authority to adjourn the Special Meeting in all other events.  In the event that a quorum is not present at the
Special Meeting, the Company currently expects that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies. 

If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the
proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.  For stockholders who attend the meeting or are represented by proxy and
abstain from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” any proposal to adjourn the
Special Meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at
the time of the Special Meeting. 

Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, but will
have no effect on any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes
to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.  A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank,
broker or other nominee holding shares of common stock on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank, broker or other
nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares of common stock.  Under applicable
stock exchange rules, brokers, banks or other nominees have the discretion to vote your shares on routine matters if you fail to instruct
your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares with respect to such matters.  The proposals in this proxy statement are
non-routine matters, and brokers, banks and other nominees therefore cannot vote on the proposals without your instructions. 

Shares of Common Stock Held by Apigee’s Directors and Executive Officers

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
11,393,548 shares of common stock, representing approximately 36.9% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the Record
Date.  Certain of our directors and executive officers and affiliated stockholders, including investment funds affiliated with certain
directors, have entered into voting agreements that obligate them to vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement.  As of the close of business on the Record Date, Apigee stockholders subject to the voting agreements collectively have
voting power over approximately 47% of the issued and outstanding shares of Apigee common stock.  For more information, see the
section captioned “The Voting Agreements” beginning on page 110. 

Voting of Proxies

If your shares of common stock are registered in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company,
LLC, you may cause your shares of common stock to be voted by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid
envelope, or you may vote in person at the Special Meeting. Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone by following the instructions

on your proxy card.  You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to grant a
proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone.  Based on your proxy cards or Internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders
will vote your shares of common stock according to your directions. 

If you plan to attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the Special Meeting.  If your
shares of common stock are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Special
Meeting in person.  If you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any previously submitted
proxy. 

Voting instructions are included on your proxy card.  All shares of common stock represented by properly signed and dated
proxies received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the
stockholder.  Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted (1) “FOR” the approval and
adoption of the Merger Agreement; and (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. 

If you submit a signed proxy card or submit your proxy by telephone or the Internet, but do not specify how you want to vote
your shares on a particular proposal, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in accordance with the recommendations of the Board
of Directors on all matters presented in this proxy statement.  With respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the
Special Meeting, the proxy holders will vote your shares in accordance with their best judgment.  If you fail to return your proxy card
and you are a holder of record on the Record Date, unless you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person, the effect will be that
your shares of common stock will not be considered for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting,
will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and, assuming a quorum is present,
will not affect the proposal regarding the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies. 

If your shares of common stock are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your
bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or
attending the Special Meeting and voting in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.  If such a service is
provided, you may vote over the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the instructions on the
voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.  If you do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting
form, do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if possible, or do not attend the Special
Meeting and vote in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have the same effect as if you voted
“AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, but will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal. 

Revocability of Proxies

If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special
Meeting by:
 

 •  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 

 •  delivering a written notice of revocation to our Secretary; or
 

 •  attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot. 

Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count.  If you have submitted a proxy, your appearance at the Special
Meeting, in the absence of voting in person or submitting an additional proxy or

revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy.  Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new
proxy card to us or by sending written notice of a revocation to our Secretary, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or
written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by us before the Special Meeting. 

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions
regarding how to change your vote.  You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank,
broker or other nominee. 

Any adjournment, postponement or other delay of the Special Meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies,
will allow stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Special Meeting as
adjourned, postponed or delayed. 

Board of Directors’ Recommendation

The Board of Directors, after considering various factors described under the caption “The Merger—Recommendation of the
Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable; (2) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of Apigee and its stockholders; (3) approved the
execution and delivery of Merger Agreement, the performance by Apigee of its covenants and obligations thereunder and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; and (4) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of
Apigee adopt the Merger.  The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (x) “FOR” the approval and adoption of the
Merger Agreement; and (y) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. 

Solicitation of Proxies

The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by Apigee.  We have retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated, a proxy solicitation
firm (the “Proxy Solicitor”), to solicit proxies in connection with the Special Meeting at a cost of $12,500 plus expenses.  We will also
indemnify the Proxy Solicitor against losses arising out of its provisions of these services on our behalf.  In addition, we may reimburse
the Company’s transfer agent, banks, brokers and other nominees representing beneficial owners of shares of common stock for their
expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to such beneficial owners.  Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers and
employees, personally or by telephone, email, fax, over the Internet or other means of communication.  No additional compensation
will be paid for such services. 

Anticipated Date of Completion of the Merger

Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by stockholders of the proposal to approve
and adopt the Merger Agreement, we anticipate that the Merger will be consummated by the end of 2016. 

Appraisal Rights

If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and
who properly perfect appraisal of their shares of common stock will be entitled, provided certain other conditions (including relating to
the aggregate amount of shares of common stock owned by stockholders seeking appraisal) are met, to appraisal of their shares of
common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.  This means that such holders of shares of common
stock are entitled to have their shares of common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash

of the “fair value” of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation
of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (subject, in
the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of
Section 262 of the DGCL), so long as they comply with the procedures established by Section 262 of the DGCL.  Due to the
complexity of the appraisal process, Apigee stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of common stock are encouraged
to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. 

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of common stock as
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the Merger
Consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of
common stock. 

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to Apigee before the vote is taken on the
adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement; and (3) continue to hold the subject shares of common stock of record through the Effective Time.  Your failure to follow
exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights.  In addition, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Apigee stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (x) the total number of
shares of common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of Apigee’s outstanding shares of
common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 of the DGCL or (y) the value of the Merger Consideration
in respect of the shares of common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million.  The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL
regarding appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.  If you hold your shares of common stock
through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such bank,
brokerage firm or nominee. 

Other Matters

At this time, we know of no other matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting.  If any other matters properly come before the
Special Meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted in accordance with the discretion of the appointed proxy holders. 

Other Information

You should NOT return your stock certificate or send documents representing common stock of Apigee with the proxy card.  If
the Merger is completed, the payment agent for the Merger will send you a letter of transmittal and related materials and instructions
for exchanging your shares of common stock for the Merger Consideration. 

Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Stockholder Meeting to be Held on November 8, 2016

The proxy statement is available at http://www.astproxyportal.com/AST/20056. 

Householding of Special Meeting Materials

Unless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of this proxy statement to any household at which two
or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family.  Each stockholder in the household will
continue to receive a separate proxy card.  This process, known as “householding,” reduces the volume of duplicate information
received at your household and helps to reduce our expenses.

PROPOSAL 1: APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

We are asking you to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the Merger Agreement and the
Merger throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the sections captioned “The Merger” beginning on page
32 of this proxy statement and “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 83 of this proxy statement.  A copy of the Merger
Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.  You are urged to read the Merger Agreement carefully in its entirety. 

Under applicable law, we cannot complete the Merger without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
common stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote as of the close of business on the Record Date voting in favor of the proposal to
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger.  If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, or
fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against the
proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. 

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 2: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. 
If stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special
Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including proxies from stockholders that have previously returned
properly executed proxies voting against approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement.  Among other things, approval of the
adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against approval and
adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could
adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of
those shares of common stock to change their votes to votes in favor of approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement.  Additionally,
we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairperson of the Special
Meeting.  The Company does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if Proposal 1 is approved by the requisite number of shares of
common stock at the Special Meeting. 

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

THE MERGER

This discussion of the Merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference.  You should read the entire Merger Agreement carefully
as it is the legal document that governs the Merger. 

Parties Involved in the Merger

Apigee Corporation
10 S. Almaden Blvd., 16th Floor,
San Jose, California 95113

Apigee is a leading provider of application program interface (“API”) technology and services for enterprises and developers. 
Apigee provides an intelligent API software platform that allows businesses to scale, secure, analyze and manage APIs as a connection
layer between their core IT systems and data and the applications with which their customers, partners, employees and other users
engage with the business.  The foundation of Apigee’s platform is Apigee Edge, a robust API-management solution.  Apigee delivers
its platform both in the cloud and on premises.  Apigee was incorporated in Delaware on June 3, 2004 and is headquartered in San
Jose, California.  Apigee’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ, under the symbol “APIC”.  Apigee’s principal executive offices
are located at 10 S. Almaden Blvd., 16th Floor, San Jose, California 95113, and its telephone number is (408) 343-7300. 

Google Inc.

Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Through products and
platforms like Search, Maps, Gmail, Android, Google Play, Chrome and YouTube, Google plays a meaningful role in the daily lives of
billions of people and has become one of the most widely-known companies in the world.  Google is a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.

Areopagus Inc.

Merger Sub is a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Google.  Merger Sub is not an operating company and
was specifically formed for the sole purpose of facilitating the Merger. 

Effect of the Merger

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub will merge with
and into Apigee, and Apigee will continue as the Surviving Corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.  As a result of the
Merger, our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from NASDAQ.  In addition, our common stock will
be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.  If the Merger is completed, you will
not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.  As the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, Apigee will
continue to exist following the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Google. 

If the Merger is completed, each share of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including shares of
common stock resulting from the deemed exercise of the warrant pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, other
than excluded shares) will be canceled, extinguished and automatically converted into the right to the Merger Consideration as
described below under the caption “—Merger Consideration”). 

The Effective Time will occur upon the filing and acceptance of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (or at such later time as we and Parent may agree and specify in the certificate of merger).

Table of Contents

Effect on Apigee if the Merger is Not Completed

If the Merger Agreement is not approved and adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock.  Instead, Apigee will remain an independent public
company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act and we will
continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.  In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we expect that management will operate the
business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that stockholders will continue to be subject to the same
risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in which Apigee
operates and risks related to adverse economic conditions. 

Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the
price of our common stock may decline significantly.  If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock
would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement. 

Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the
future value of your shares of common stock.  If the Merger is not completed, the Board of Directors will continue to evaluate and
review Apigee’s business operations, strategic direction and capitalization, among other things, and will make such changes as are
deemed appropriate.  If the Merger Agreement is not approved and adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any
other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Board of Directors will be offered or that Apigee’s
business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted. 

In addition, Apigee will be required to pay to Parent a termination fee of $21,750,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated
under certain specified circumstances, and Parent will be required to pay to Apigee a termination fee of $46,600,000 if the Merger
Agreement is terminated under other specified circumstances, in each case, without limiting the ability of any party to collect any
losses resulting from a willful and intentional breach of the Merger Agreement prior to its termination, or any fraud committed in
connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.  For more information please see the section
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees.”

Merger Consideration

In the Merger, each share of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including shares of common
stock resulting from the deemed exercise of the warrant pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement) will be
canceled, extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive $17.40 per share in cash, without interest and less any
applicable taxes (other than excluded shares). 

After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights
as a stockholder (except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the
“fair value” of their shares of common stock as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law, as
described below under the caption “—Appraisal Rights”). 

Background of the Merger

The Company’s Board of Directors has regularly evaluated Apigee’s strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view
toward strengthening Apigee’s business and enhancing stockholder value.  As part of this evaluation, the Board of Directors has, from
time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives. These have included, among others, (1) the continuation of Apigee’s current
business plan as an independent enterprise; (2) modifications to Apigee’s strategy and product suite; (3) potential expansion
opportunities into new businesses through acquisitions of other businesses and product lines; and (4) a possible sale of Apigee.

On April 20, 2016, a corporate development executive at a customer of Apigee’s (“Party 1”), had an introductory phone call with
Chet Kapoor, the chief executive officer of the Company.  Subsequently, on May 5, 2016, Mr. Kapoor and Tim Wan, the chief financial
officer of the Company, met with the representative of Party 1 at the Company’s offices in San Jose, California.  During the meeting,
the representative of Party 1 expressed Party 1’s preliminary interest in exploring a potential strategic transaction with the Company. 

On May 18, 2016, the Board of Directors held a regularly-scheduled meeting.  Several members of management attended the
meeting, as well as representatives from Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati P.C. (“WSGR”), Apigee’s outside legal advisors.  At this
meeting, the Board and members of management discussed various matters related to the ongoing operations and strategic direction of
the Company, including a review of the Company’s financial results from the third fiscal quarter of 2016, and preliminary outlook for
the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter of 2016.  In a closed session with the other members of the Board, Mr. Kapoor described the
preliminary outreach from Party 1 regarding a potential strategic transaction.  After discussion, the Board directed Mr. Kapoor to work
with Company management to continue to engage Party 1 to assist with developing Party 1’s understanding of the Company and its
businesses, all with a view to clarifying Party 1’s intentions with respect to a potential strategic transaction.  Members of the further
discussed with Mr. Kapoor that, if the outreach from Party 1 developed into a concrete proposal, the Board would want to consider
engaging a financial advisory firm to assist the Board in evaluating the proposal and/or in conducting a strategic review process, and
that Apigee management should in that event investigate candidate advisory firms to propose for the Board’s consideration. 

On June 8, 2016, the Company entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Party 1 in order to allow the Company to share
information with Party 1 on a confidential basis.  On the same day, representatives of Party 1, including representatives from their
corporate development group, met at the Company’s offices with Mr. Kapoor, Mr. Wan, and Anant Jhingran, the chief technology
officer of the Company.  At this meeting, the representatives of Apigee presented an overview of the Company, including its business,
technology and operations. 

On June 22, 2016, a representative of Party 1 called Mr. Kapoor to inform him that the Company would be receiving an indication
of interest from Party 1.  Later that day, the Company received a non-binding indication of interest from Party 1 proposing an
acquisition of Apigee by Party 1 at an acquisition price of $15.50 per share in cash.  The proposal was subject to the Company agreeing
to enter into a thirty-day period of exclusive negotiations with Party 1.  The closing price of the Company’s stock on June 22, 2016 was
$12.62 per share. 

On June 23, 2016, the Board of Directors held a special meeting, with several members of Apigee management in attendance.  At
the special meeting, Mr. Kapoor updated the Board regarding the non-binding indication of interest that had been received from Party
1, and recapped the meetings and discussions with Party 1 which had preceded Party 1’s delivery of the indication of interest.  The
members of the Board asked questions and discussed these developments and the Company’s strategic alternatives.  The Board
determined that the receipt of the proposal from Party 1 warranted further exploration of the strategic alternatives available to the
Company.  Mr. Kapoor noted that, consistent with the Board’s suggestion at the end of its prior meeting, Apigee management had
prepared an analysis regarding several candidate financial advisory firms which Apigee might choose to consider engaging to help the
Board evaluate strategic alternatives for the Company.  Mr. Kapoor presented this analysis to the Board, including the results of
interviews with such firms, recent experience on strategic transactions, and other potential criteria for selection.  Following this
discussion, the Board of Directors authorized management to engage Morgan Stanley to assist the Company with respect to the
strategic process, in light of, among other criteria, Morgan Stanley’s extensive familiarity with the Company, including its role as joint
book-runner for the Company’s initial public offering, its reputation with potential parties which might be interested in pursuing a
strategic transaction with Apigee, and its involvement in a number of recent similar transactions in which Morgan Stanley had served
as financial advisor to other enterprise software companies.  The Board further directed management to negotiate and finalize an
engagement letter with Morgan Stanley, which was subsequently entered into on July 1.  Following this discussion and in light of the
proposal received

from Party 1, the Board of Directors authorized management, in consultation with the Company’s financial and legal advisors, to
initiate a strategic alternatives process, including a targeted outreach to various potential bidders. 

Commencing on June 24, 2016, and following instruction from the Board and Company management, representatives of Morgan
Stanley initiated contact with a range of parties to evaluate such parties’ interest in a strategic transaction with the Company, as well as
to coordinate management meetings with interested parties. Over the course of the next several weeks, Morgan Stanley contacted seven
(7) strategic parties (in addition to Party 1), as well as nine (9) financial sponsors in respect of their interest in evaluating a potential
transaction with the Company as part of its strategic alternatives process. 

In the course of this preliminary outreach, four (4) of the contacted strategic parties, and five (5) of the contacted financial
sponsors, indicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley that they would decline to participate in the process.  Between June 25 and
July 14, 2016, each of the parties remaining in the process (other than Party 1), including Google, a strategic party we refer to as “Party
2” and a strategic party we refer to as “Party 3”, entered into a non-disclosure agreement to allow the Company to share information on
a confidential basis. 

After preliminary discussions between representatives of Morgan Stanley and one of the contacted financial sponsors (“Sponsor
1”), on June 24, 2016, Mr. Kapoor met with representatives of Sponsor 1 to discuss the Company’s business, operations and
technology, as well as Sponsor 1’s interest in a strategic transaction with the Company. 

On June 30, 2016, Mr. Kapoor contacted a representative of Party 1 by email to indicate that representatives of Morgan Stanley
would be reaching out to Party 1.  Later that same day, representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed with representatives of Party 1
planned next steps in the evaluation process and informed Party 1 of a meeting of the Board occurring on July 7, 2016 to consider Party
1’s proposal. 

On July 5, 2016, members of Apigee management conducted in-person presentations regarding the Company’s business,
operations and technology separately with management of Party 2, and with management of a financial sponsor (“Sponsor 2”). 

The day following such meetings, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke with representatives of Party 2 to preview Party 2’s
additional due diligence requests that were subsequently provided to representatives of Morgan Stanley on July 7, 2016. 

On July 7, 2016, the Board of Directors held a special meeting.  Several members of management attended the meeting, as well as
representatives of Morgan Stanley and legal advisors from WSGR.  At the invitation of the Board, a representative of WSGR reviewed
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors, and explained the relevance of financial projections in the context of a potential strategic
transaction.  Members of Company management reviewed the preliminary fiscal year 2017 financial operating plan of the Company,
and an overall trended view of the preliminary fiscal year 2018 and 2019 financial forecasts based upon material previously delivered
to the Board of Directors (which forecasts form part of the Case A Projections discussed in the section of this proxy statement below
captioned “—Management Projections”).  The Board of Directors reviewed and discussed the presented preliminary financial
forecasts. 

At the request of the Board at the special meeting, the representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an overview of the current
state of the strategic alternatives process, including discussing the management due diligence sessions held or planned.  The
representatives of Morgan Stanley recapped the strategic and financial sponsor parties who were contacted and noted which parties had
expressed an interest in continuing to participate in the process, including that Party 1 was one of those parties who remained engaged
in the process, as well as noting the parties who had declined further participation.  The representatives of Morgan Stanley noted that,

date, only Party 1 had provided a non-binding indication of interest, and highlighted Party 1’s proposed terms, including a proposed
acquisition price of $15.50 per share in cash and a request for a thirty-day exclusivity period.  The representatives of Morgan Stanley
further described other potentially interested parties who could be invited to participate in the process.  Then, the representatives of
Morgan Stanley provided an overview of the expected timeline and proposed next steps with respect to the strategic alternatives
process. 

Next, at the Board’s request, representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed a preliminary valuation analysis of the Company as a
standalone business based upon management’s forecasted business and financial model (the “Case A Projections”), including a
comparison to analysts’ consensus estimates; and premiums paid in recent acquisition transactions involving software (both on-premise
and SaaS based) companies and in technology acquisitions more broadly.  The Board then discussed its ongoing review of the
Company’s stand-alone strategy, focusing on the assumptions underlying the Case A Projections, and the premiums paid in the current
market environment.  Following discussion, the Board directed management to develop and provide to the Board for consideration at a
future meeting a risk-adjusted version of the preliminary financial model reviewed in the meeting, including updated assumptions and
sensitivities, for the Board’s further consideration and decision-making process.  The Board authorized management, in consultation
with the Company’s financial and legal advisors, to continue forward with the strategic alternatives process, including by contacting
additional potentially interested parties as outlined by Morgan Stanley at the meeting, and further directed management and Morgan
Stanley to instruct potential bidders that the Board would be inclined to support a proposal with a price of $18.00 per share in cash or
higher to move forward with a potential strategic transaction. 

In accordance with guidance from the Board of Directors and Apigee management, starting on July 7, 2016 and continuing
through the following week, representatives of Morgan Stanley reached out to seven (7) additional strategic parties to evaluate each
such party’s interest in a potential strategic transaction with the Company as well as coordinating management meetings with each
party that indicated an interest in participating in the Company’s strategic alternatives process, with two (2) of such additional
contacted parties ultimately entering into non-disclosure agreements and the other additional contacted parties declining to participate
in the process. 

Also on July 7, 2016, members of Apigee management, together with representatives of Morgan Stanley, conducted an in-person
presentation regarding the Company’s business, technology and operations with management of Party 1 and its financial advisor.  At
the meeting, representatives of Apigee and Morgan Stanley reiterated to Party 1 the Board of Directors’ decision to conduct a process
to explore a sale of the Company, that Party 1’s price was not viewed by the Board as sufficiently high to preempt the strategic
alternatives process, that the Company was not prepared to enter into negotiations with Party 1 at that time for a proposed price of less
than $18.00 per share in cash, and that the Company was expecting bids to be received, including any potential revised bid from Party
1, in advance of the Board’s planned meeting on July 22, 2016. 

On July 11, 2016, Apigee management conducted a due diligence call with Party 2 and continued to discuss Party 2’s interest in
pursuing an acquisition of the Company.  During the period from July 13 to July 20, 2016, Party 2 provided the Company with a series
of additional due diligence requests, and the Company responded to such requests, and representatives of the Company and of Party 2
held additional due diligence discussions. 

From July 12 to July 18, 2016, members of Company management separately met with or had telephone conferences with
members of management of seven (7) of the interested parties to present an overview of the Company and its business, including to the
management of Google, Party 3 and Sponsor 1, as well as to two (2) additional strategic parties and to two (2) financial sponsors. 
Following these meetings, Apigee and its representatives had no further substantive contacts regarding a potential transaction with any
party contacted as part of the strategic alternatives process, other than Google, Party 1, Party 2 and Party 3. 

On July 15, 2016, each of Google and Party 3 separately indicated to representatives of Morgan Stanley its respective desire to
move forward with a further evaluation of a potential acquisition of the Company.  Party 3

also noted it would require at least a month to prepare a proposal, to which representatives of Morgan Stanley responded that it would
be challenging for the Company’s process to accommodate such a delay and emphasized that Party 3 should perform its evaluation and
prepare any proposal as expeditiously as possible within the same timeframe as other potential bidders.  Google noted it would require
several weeks to determine if it would be interested in submitting a proposal, and that it would not be likely to be able to make such
determination in advance of the Board of Directors’ planned meeting on July 22, 2016, to which representatives of Morgan Stanley
responded that Google should perform its evaluation and prepare any proposal as expeditiously as possible within the same timeframe
as other potential bidders. 

In addition, on July 15, 2016, the Board of Directors had a special meeting.  Several members of management attended the
meeting, as well as legal advisors from WSGR.  At the invitation of the Board, a representative of WSGR reviewed the fiduciary duties
of the Board of Directors, and explained the relevance of financial projections in the context of a potential strategic transaction. 
Mr. Wan then recapped the preliminary fiscal year 2017 financial operating plan of the Company, and an overall trended view of the
preliminary fiscal year 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 financial forecasts based upon material previously delivered to the Board (which
forecasts form part of the Case A Projections).  Mr. Wan also reviewed a preliminary risk-adjusted fiscal year 2017 through 2021
financial plan (the “Case B Projections”) which had been prepared at the request of the Board of Directors at the July 7, 2016 special
meeting.  Following Mr. Wan’s review, the Board of Directors discussed the Case B Projections overall, including the assumptions and
sensitivities, and directed Mr. Wan to make a few adjustments to certain assumptions. 

At the request of the Board of Directors, members of Apigee management then reviewed recent progress in the strategic
alternatives process, including contacts and discussions with potential bidders.  The Board further authorized management, in
consultation with the Company’s financial and legal advisors, to continue forward with the strategic alternatives process. 

On July 16, 2016 and July 17, 2016, the Company received due diligence requests from Party 3 and Google, respectively, to
which the Company prepared written responses over the subsequent days. 

On July 19, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company held a special meeting.  Several members of Company management
attended the meeting, as did legal advisors from WSGR.  Mr. Wan reviewed the Case B Projections which had been revised at the
request of the Board at the July 15, 2016 special meeting.  Next, Mr. Wan highlighted a number of assumptions and related sensitivities
made in this revised case with the Board of Directors.  Following Mr. Wan’s review, the Board of Directors discussed the Case B
Projections overall, including the assumptions and sensitivities.  The Board then approved the Case B Projections, as revised, and
directed management to deliver such projections to Morgan Stanley for use in its valuation analysis of the Company (which Case B
Projections are discussed in the section of this proxy statement below captioned “—Management Projections”) based on a risk-adjusted
financial model, reflecting greater consideration of some of the macro challenges in achieving the Case A Projections. 

On July 20, 2016, a representative of Party 2 reached out to a representative of Morgan Stanley to indicate that Party 2 would be
delivering to the Company a non-binding indication of interest, proposing a price of $14.50 per share in cash.  The representative of
Morgan Stanley indicated to the representative of Party 2 that it was his expectation that such a proposed price would not be
competitive with the other proposals, and indicated that Party 2 would likely need to materially increase its proposed price in order to
remain in the process.  Later on July 20, 2016, the Company did receive the anticipated non-binding indication of interest from Party 2,
proposing a price of $14.50 per share in cash.  The proposal was subject to the Company entering into a thirty-day exclusivity period
with Party 2.  The closing price of the Company’s stock on July 20, 2016 was $12.15. 

On July 21, 2016, the Board of Directors held a special meeting.  Several members of management attended the meeting, as well
as representatives of Morgan Stanley and legal advisors from WSGR.  At the request of the Board of Directors, representatives of
Morgan Stanley reviewed the status of the strategic alternatives process

and the discussions to date with the participants in the process, including the non-binding preliminary indications of interest received to
date from Party 1 and Party 2.  Representatives of Morgan Stanley also reviewed the participation of the additional parties, including
Google and Party 3, who had been engaged in the process and who had indicated continued interest in evaluating the Company but had
yet to complete their diligence in order to be in a position to submit a proposal to the Company.  At the request of the Board of
Directors, representatives of Morgan Stanley also provided an overview of the strategic parties and financial sponsors that had declined
to participate or had elected to discontinue in the process.  The representatives of Morgan Stanley noted that including Party 1, twenty-
four (24) parties had been contacted, including fifteen (15) strategic parties and nine (9) financial sponsors.  The representatives of
Morgan Stanley further noted that ten (10) of these parties had participated in meetings with Apigee management, but that other than
Party 1, Party 2, Party 3 and Google, each party (including Sponsor 1 and Sponsor 2) had declined further participation in Apigee’s
strategic alternatives process. 

Next, at the direction of the Board of Directors a representative of Morgan Stanley provided a preliminary valuation analysis of
the Company as a standalone enterprise based upon each of the Case A and Case B Projections, and reviewed premiums and revenue
multiples paid in recent acquisition transactions involving software (both on-premise and SaaS based) companies as well as premiums
paid in technology acquisitions more broadly.  The Board of Directors, members of management, and the Company’s financial and
legal advisors discussed next steps and the potential timeline of the strategic alternatives process and related considerations. Following
such discussion, the Board of Directors authorized and directed that management, in consultation with the Company’s financial and
legal advisors, continue with the strategic alternatives process as discussed, and directed representatives of Morgan Stanley to inform
Party 2 that Apigee would not pursue further discussions on the basis of its current non-binding indication of interest. 

Later on July 21, 2016, representatives of Party 2 contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley and communicated that Party 2
would not materially increase their proposed price above $14.50 per share in cash. Consistent with the direction of Apigee management
and the Board of Directors, the representatives of Morgan Stanley responded by informing the representatives of Party 2 that Party 2’s
proposal of $14.50 per share in cash would not be sufficient to merit continued engagement of the Company with Party 2 unless they
materially improved their offer.  The Company did not have any further material contacts with Party 2 as part of Apigee’s strategic
alternatives process. 

Also on July 21, 2016, representatives of Morgan Stanley informed Party 1 that the Company had received an additional non-
binding indication of interest and was expecting other proposals, noting that the Company intended to continue to engage in strategic
discussions with Party 1 and other interested parties.  At the direction of Apigee management and the Board of Directors,
representatives of Morgan Stanley also indicated to representatives of Party 1 that the Board was not prepared to enter into exclusive
negotiations at that time for a proposed price of less than $18.00 per share in cash.  Party 1 declined to modify its proposal and its
representatives stated that Party 1 might be prepared to increase its proposal, but would only do so if it would be able to enter into a
period of exclusive negotiation with Apigee. 

Also on July 21, 2016, representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Google in Mountain View, California to
review the Company’s responses to Google’s preliminary due diligence request.  In addition, at the direction of Company management
as consistent with the direction of the Board of Directors, representatives of Morgan Stanley indicated to Google that the Company had
instructed Morgan Stanley to communicate to bidders that the Board would be inclined to support a proposal with a price of $18.00 per
share in cash or higher to move forward with a potential strategic transaction. 

On July 27, 2016, the Company provided Google with a supplemental due diligence information presentation.  The following day,
Google requested additional due diligence information, which Apigee provided to Google the same day.  On July 29, 2016, members of
Apigee management met with representatives of Google, including Diane Greene, a senior vice president in charge of Google’s cloud
business, to give an overview of the Company’s business, technology and prospects.

On July 28, 2016, members of Apigee management participated in an in-person and video conference with representatives of
Party 1 to further discuss the Company’s technology, business and prospects. 

On July 29, 2016, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke to representatives of Party 3 regarding next steps and to evaluate Party
3’s continued interest in acquiring the Company.  The representatives of Party 3 reiterated that Party 3 would likely be unable to
prepare a proposal until the week of August 22, 2016, to which representatives of Morgan Stanley responded that the Company’s
process would not likely be able to accommodate such a delay.  Party 3 requested a follow-up meeting with management to evaluate
the opportunity further.  Subsequent to this request, on August 3, 2016, members of Apigee management met with Party 3 to discuss
follow-up due diligence items, and the Company also continued to respond to additional diligence requests from Party 3. 

On August 1, 2016, representatives of Google and representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed the potential timing of receiving a
proposal from Google as well as having a follow-up meeting to discuss due diligence requests. 

On August 2, 2016, Apigee received a revised non-binding indication of interest from Party 1 with a proposed indicative price of
$16.50 per share in cash.  The proposal was subject to the Company entering into a thirty-day exclusivity period.  The closing price of
the Company’s stock on August 2, 2016 was $12.30.  Party 1 requested that Apigee respond to its proposal by August 5, 2016. 

Also on August 2, 2016, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke to representatives of Google for an update on their evaluation
of the Company, and Google indicated that they were still deciding whether or not to submit a proposal.  Morgan Stanley informed
them the process was moving quickly and recommended a meeting the next day between Mr. Kapoor and Ms. Greene of Google since
both were attending a conference hosted by Morgan Stanley in Deer Valley, Utah. 

Also on August 2, 2016, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke to representatives of Party 3 to indicate that the process was
moving quickly and that the Company’s process would not likely be able to accommodate Party 3’s previously indicated timing of
August 22.  In addition, at the direction of Company management and the Board of Directors, representatives of Morgan Stanley
indicated to Party 3 that the Company had instructed Morgan Stanley to communicate to bidders that the Board would be inclined to
support a proposal with a price of $18.00 per share in cash or higher to move forward with a potential strategic transaction. 

On August 3, 2016, Mr. Kapoor and Ms. Greene met for breakfast to discuss the potential transaction in Deer Valley, Utah at a
conference hosted by Morgan Stanley, at which meeting they discussed, among other topics, potential synergies from a strategic
transaction between Google and the Company, and potential roles for Mr. Kapoor following such a transaction.  Following this
meeting, representatives of Google informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that Google intended to complete its due diligence with
the intent of submitting a proposal to acquire Apigee. 

On August 4, 2016, members of Apigee management and representatives of Morgan Stanley met with Google to discuss follow-
up due diligence items.  Following the meeting, Google delivered additional due diligence requests, to which the Company responded. 

On August 5, 2016, the Board of Directors held a special meeting.  Several members of management attended the meeting, as
well as representatives of Morgan Stanley and legal advisors from WSGR.  Mr. Kapoor and representatives of Morgan Stanley
discussed recent developments in the strategic alternatives process, including the status of discussions and negotiations with Google,
Party 1 and Party 3, which were the remaining interested strategic parties, and the revised non-binding indication of interest from Party
1.  Mr. Kapoor and representatives from Morgan Stanley also discussed a plan for engagement with such parties, as well as a potential
timeline for the process.  After discussion, the Board authorized and directed the Company’s management, in consultation with the
Company’s financial and legal advisors, to continue engagement with these interested strategic parties.

Later on August 5, 2016, at the direction of Company management and the Board of Directors, representatives of Morgan Stanley
reiterated to representatives of Party 1 that the Board was not prepared to enter into negotiations based on a proposed price of $16.50
per share in cash and that the Board would be inclined to support a proposal with a price of $18.00 per share in cash or higher to move
forward with a potential strategic transaction.  The representatives of Party 1 indicated that Party 1 would consider this feedback. 

On August 9, 2016, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke to representatives of Party 3 to discuss timing and process.  That
same day, representatives of Morgan Stanley spoke to representatives of Google, who provided an update on Google’s internal
process. 

On August 12, 2016, representatives of Morgan Stanley and representatives of Google had a telephone conference to discuss the
current status of the strategic alternatives process and planning for a potential transaction.  That same day, representatives of Morgan
Stanley met with representatives of Party 1 to discuss the current status of the process. 

On August 15, 2016, a press article was published, speculating that there was currently a sale process underway for the
Company.  On that day, the closing price of the Company’s stock was $14.32 per share. 

On August 15 and 16, 2016, representatives of Morgan Stanley informed Google that unless it promptly submitted a proposal,
there was a risk Apigee could enter into exclusive negotiations with another party. 

On August 17, 2016, representatives of Google called representatives of Morgan Stanley to indicate that Google would be in a
position to submit a proposal that evening or the next morning, but would only do so once Apigee confirmed that the Board of
Directors was prepared to meet promptly to consider such proposal, and that such proposal would be subject to a short expiration. 
Following that discussion, the Company convened a meeting of the Board for the following day.  After discussing with certain
members of the Board of Directors, Mr. Kapoor instructed Morgan Stanley to notify representatives of each of Party 1 and Party 3 that
the Company’s strategic alternatives process would be concluding imminently and that the Board of Directors would be meeting the
following day with the objective of entering into a period of exclusive negotiations with the highest bidder. 

Also on August 17, 2016, representatives of Morgan Stanley and representatives of the Company had multiple communications
with representatives of Party 1.  During those conversations, representatives of Party 1 indicated that Party 1 may be willing to meet
and discuss a bid higher than $16.50 per share in cash, but that it was not willing to pursue a transaction at a price as high as $18.00 per
share.  Representatives of Morgan Stanley informed the representatives of Party 1 that Party 1’s then-current bid of $16.50 per share in
cash may be insufficient to prevail, and instructed Party 1 to submit its best and final offer.  Party 1 declined to further increase its bid
at that time, and Party 1’s representatives reiterated that they would not be willing to increase their proposed price without exclusive
negotiations. 

Also on August 17, 2016, representatives of Morgan Stanley contacted representatives of Party 3 to update them on the timing of
the strategic alternatives process and its potential conclusion. 

On the morning of August 18, 2016, Apigee received a non-binding indication of interest from Google with a proposed price of
$17.10 per share in cash, which, by its terms, would expire at 4:00 p.m. Pacific time that day. The proposal was subject to the Company
entering into a three-week period of exclusive negotiations with Google.  The closing price of the Company’s stock on August 18, 2016
was $14.28.  Following receipt of the Google proposal, representatives of Morgan Stanley again called Party 1 and informed them that
they were not the highest bid, requested that they submit their best and final offer, and reiterated that the Board of Directors’ intent was
to enter into exclusive negotiations with the highest bidder. 

Also on the morning of August 18, 2016, Party 3 informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that it would not be submitting a
bid for consideration.

On the morning of August 18, 2016, the Board of Directors held a special meeting.  Several members of Company management
attended the meeting, as well as representatives of Morgan Stanley and legal advisors from WSGR.  At the request of the Board,
representatives of Morgan Stanley updated the Board on developments in the strategic alternatives process, including describing the
progression of discussions and negotiations with the several interested strategic parties, as well as recapping the prior outreach to the
other contacted strategic parties and financial sponsors.  A representative of Morgan Stanley next discussed in detail both Party 1’s
revised non-binding indication of interest which proposed a price of $16.50 per share in cash, and the non-binding indication of interest
from Google which proposed a price of $17.10 per share in cash, and further described the valuation proposition implied by each of
these two indications of interest in light of the preliminary valuation analysis of the Company as a standalone enterprise.  A
representative of Morgan Stanley also reminded the Board of Directors that Party 2 had not participated further in the process after
deciding not to increase its initial proposal of $14.50 per share in cash.  The representative of Morgan Stanley further noted that Party 3
had continued to indicate that it was not yet in a position to submit a proposal. 

At the special meeting, the representative of Morgan Stanley noted that Google’s non-binding indication of interest was expressly
contingent on the Company’s willingness to enter into an exclusivity agreement through September 7, 2016 that would give Google a
period of exclusive negotiations during which the parties could negotiate the non-price terms of a transaction and finalize confirmatory
legal due diligence, and that Google had indicated its proposal would be withdrawn if the Company did not enter into such an
exclusivity agreement with Google prior to 4:00 p.m. Pacific time on August 18, 2016.  A representative of WSGR discussed various
implications of the proposed exclusivity agreement, including that it would require the Company to discontinue any further marketing
efforts and negotiations to seek a higher price for the Company from other parties during the exclusivity period, and recapped certain
aspects of the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties in relation to its consideration of a sale transaction.  Further discussion ensued
among the members of the Board of Directors, management, and the Company’s financial and legal advisors with respect to the
foregoing, including, among other items, legal aspects of the proposals received and the fiduciary duties of the Board in evaluating
such proposals and considering the Company’s stand-alone strategy. 

Following discussion at the special meeting, the Board of Directors authorized Apigee management and Morgan Stanley to
inform Party 1 that its current proposed price of $16.50 in cash was not the highest bid, and that the Company intended to agree to a
period of exclusivity with a party other than Party 1 by the end of the day, unless Party 1 raised its bid.  In light of Party 1’s prior
indication that it would not be willing to contemplate a potential transaction for a price as high as $18.00 per share, and in light of input
from Morgan Stanley and the Board of Directors’ view that Party 1 might be willing to submit a revised non-binding proposal with an
increased priced in the range of $17.00 to $17.50 per share in cash, the Board directed Morgan Stanley to seek a proposed price of at
least $17.50 per share in cash from Google in exchange for the Company agreeing to enter into an exclusivity arrangement.  The Board
further authorized management to commence negotiations on the non-price terms of a proposed transaction with the bidder with whom
the Company entered into an exclusivity agreement, with a view to accepting such proposal if the parties could reach agreement on the
non-price terms of the proposed transaction. 

After the special meeting of the Board of Directors on August 18, 2016, at the direction of Apigee management, representatives
of Morgan Stanley asked Google to increase its proposed price to $17.55 per share in order for the Company to enter into an
exclusivity agreement with Google. 

During the course of the day on August 18, 2016, representatives of Morgan Stanley and the Company had multiple
communications with representatives of Party 1 on behalf of the Company to reiterate to Party 1 that based on the current proposals
received, it was anticipated that the Board of Directors would agree to a period of exclusivity with a party other than Party 1 by the end
of the day, unless Party 1 raised its bid.  Representatives of Party 1 asked representatives of Morgan Stanley for an indication of the
price hurdle Party 1 would need to meet for the Company to move forward with Party 1, and representatives of Morgan Stanley
declined to provide price guidance beyond that which had already been given to all parties.  During these discussions, Party 1 did not
increase its previously-proposed price.

Later that day, Google indicated that it would increase the price per share in its indicative non-binding proposal to $17.40 per
share, subject to the Company agreeing to a three-week exclusivity period with Google. Following that discussion, representatives of
Morgan Stanley indicated to representatives of Party 1 that the Company was in final negotiations with the high bidder and that the
Company would enter into an exclusivity agreement by 4:00 p.m. Pacific time. 

Later in the day on August 18, 2016 at approximately 4:00 p.m. Pacific time, and in light of the facts that Party 1 had not
provided an increased proposed price above $16.50 per share in cash, that Google had increased its proposed price to $17.40 per share
in cash, that Google had previously indicated that its proposal would expire shortly, and that there was a risk that Google might cease
further participation in the process, the Company entered into an exclusivity agreement with Google with the exclusivity period
scheduled to end on September 7, 2016.  At the direction of the Board of Directors, a representative of WSGR delivered an initial draft
of the Merger Agreement to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (“Skadden”), legal counsel to Google. 

Over the following weeks, Google’s management, together with its advisors, engaged in detailed confirmatory due diligence with
Apigee, which included access to a data room, and meetings and presentations on, among other things, accounting, finance, legal,
intellectual property and tax matters.  Over a similar period of time, representatives of WSGR and Skadden, together with members of
management of Apigee and Google, negotiated the non-price terms of the Merger Agreement, such as the scope of the Company’s
obligations not to solicit alternative transaction proposals, the Board’s right to change its recommendation in favor of the Merger,
Apigee’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal, and the scope of the parties’ respective
representations, warranties and other covenants.  In particular, representatives of WSGR and Skadden exchanged multiple drafts of the
Merger Agreement, and, at the direction of Apigee and Google, negotiated, among other items, the parties’ obligations with respect to
seeking regulatory approval of the Merger, and Google’s conditions to closing with respect to the accuracy of certain of the Company’s
representations.

On September 2, 2016, the Board of Directors held a special meeting.  Several members of Apigee management attended the
meeting, as well as representatives of Morgan Stanley and legal advisors from WSGR. At the direction of the Board of Directors, a
representative of WSGR gave a presentation on the fiduciary duties of Board of Directors in the context of potential strategic
transactions.  The Board of Directors asked questions throughout the presentation. 

Also at the special meeting, at the request of the Board of Directors, a representative of Morgan Stanley updated the Board on
developments in the strategic alternatives process since the prior Board meeting, and recapped the prior outreach to the contacted
strategic parties and financial sponsors who were no longer participating in the process.  The representative of Morgan Stanley then
recapped in detail the progression of discussions and negotiations with the several remaining interested strategic parties and the history
of the bidding process with Party 1 and Google, including that the Company had received an indication of interest from Party 1, which
ultimately proposed a price of $16.50 per share in cash, and an indication of interest from Google, which had ultimately proposed a
price of $17.40 per share in cash, and further described the valuation proposition implied by each of these two indications of interest in
light of the preliminary valuation analysis of the Company as a standalone enterprise which had been discussed at prior Board
meetings.  A representative of Morgan Stanley also reminded the Board that Party 2 had declined to participate further in the process
after submitting an initial proposal of $14.50 per share in cash, and that as of August 18, 2016, Party 3 was continuing its review and
had indicated that it was not yet in a position to submit a proposal.  The representative of Morgan Stanley indicated that Morgan
Stanley had not heard from Party 3 since such date.  The Board made inquiries in this regard and discussion ensued.  A representative
of Morgan Stanley then discussed that Google’s indication of interest had been expressly contingent on the Company’s willingness to
enter into an exclusivity agreement, which the Company had agreed to on August 18, 2016. 

Next, a representative of Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Board of Directors the valuation analysis of the Company as a
standalone enterprise based upon management’s forecasted business and financial model reflected

in the Case B Projections as previously directed by the Board.  A representative of Morgan Stanley also reviewed premiums and
revenue multiples paid in recent acquisition transactions involving software and cloud-based companies as well as premiums paid in
technology acquisitions more broadly.  The Board of Directors made inquiries of representatives of Morgan Stanley with respect to the
foregoing, and discussion ensued. 

At the direction of the Board of Directors, a representative of WSGR then reviewed the key terms of the proposed Merger
Agreement and the voting agreements, all of which remained subject to ongoing negotiations. The representative of WSGR highlighted
the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to closing certainty, regulatory approvals (including discussing the possibility of
proposing a termination fee payable by Google to Apigee in certain circumstances related to a termination following a failure to receive
clearance from antitrust authorities), the Company’s ability to entertain and accept any unsolicited competing acquisition proposals that
it might receive during the pendency of a transaction with Google (and the related termination fee payable by the Company in certain
circumstances principally related to a termination connected to the Company accepting a superior proposal for an acquisition by
another party).  In addition, the representative of WSGR reviewed certain other terms with the Board of Directors, including those
concerning the transaction structure, approval of the transaction by the Company’s stockholders, and various other representations,
warranties, conditions and covenants under the Merger Agreement.  Finally, the representative of WSGR noted certain open terms
which were still being negotiated with Google and Skadden.  The Board of Directors provided feedback and direction on the remaining
unresolved issues in the Merger Agreement and instructed WSGR and Company management to seek to finalize these issues in
accordance with its guidance. 

Further discussion then ensued among members of the Board of Directors, management, and the Company’s financial and legal
advisors with respect to the foregoing, including, among other items, legal aspects of the proposals received and the fiduciary duties of
the Board in evaluating such proposals and considering the Company’s stand-alone strategy. 

Mr. Kapoor then discussed the proposed communication plan with respect to a transaction with Google should the parties resolve
the outstanding items still under negotiation in the Merger Agreement.  Mr. Kapoor also noted the exclusivity period with Google was
scheduled to terminate on September 7, 2016, and that Skadden had communicated to WSGR that Google desired to extend the
exclusivity period.  The Board of Directors discussed the positive and negative aspects of extending exclusivity.  The Board authorized
Mr. Kapoor to extend the exclusivity period if Mr. Kapoor determined in his discretion that it would be necessary or helpful in
finalizing the Merger Agreement. 

On September 4, 2016, the Company and Google entered into a letter agreement amending the exclusivity agreement between the
parties to extend the term of exclusive negotiations through September 9, 2016. 

Between September 2 and September 7, 2016, representatives of WSGR and Skadden, together with members of management of
Apigee and Google, continued to negotiate the remaining terms of the Merger Agreement, including negotiating the parent termination
fee of $46,600,000 payable to Apigee by Google in certain circumstances related to a termination of the Merger Agreement following a
failure to receive clearance from antitrust authorities, and the company termination fee of $21,750,000 payable by Apigee to Google in
certain circumstances following a termination of the Merger Agreement (including in connection with accepting a superior proposal).
For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees” beginning on
page 106.  Also during this time, representatives of WSGR and Skadden, together with members of management of Apigee and
Google, finalized documentation related to the Merger Agreement, including the voting agreements discussed in the section of this
proxy statement below captioned “—Voting Agreements” and Google’s management, together with its advisors, finalized its due
diligence investigation of Apigee. 

On September 6, 2016, representatives of Google orally previewed with Mr. Kapoor the key terms of a draft offer letter between
Google and Mr. Kapoor, proposed to become effective following the consummation of the Merger. On September 7, 2016, after
negotiation, representatives of Google delivered such draft offer letter to

Mr. Kapoor, along with similar draft offer letters to certain other members of Apigee management. After further negotiation, such offer
letters were subsequently executed by Google and, as applicable, by Mr. Kapoor and by such other members of Apigee management on
the evening of September 7, 2016 substantially concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement. For more information, see
the sections of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Employment
Arrangements Following the Merger.”

On September 7, 2016, the Board of Directors held a special meeting.  Several members of Company management attended the
meeting, as well as representatives of Morgan Stanley and legal advisors from WSGR. Representatives of WSGR presented the Merger
Agreement, and described the final changes to the Merger Agreement, which had been finalized with Skadden earlier that day, subject
to final review and approval by the Board. 

Morgan Stanley then delivered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of September 7, 2016, and based upon
and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Company
common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.  For more information about Morgan Stanley’s opinion, see the section of this proxy statement below captioned “The Merger
—Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor, beginning on page 48.”

After discussing potential reasons for and against the proposed transaction (see below under the headings “—Recommendation of
the Board of Directors” and “—Reasons for the Merger”), the Board of Directors unanimously (among those directors present at the
special meeting) (1) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are
advisable; (2) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in
the best interests of Apigee and its stockholders; (3) approved the execution and delivery of Merger Agreement, the performance by
Apigee of its covenants and obligations thereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger; and (4) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Apigee adopt the Merger Agreement. 

In addition, the Board of Directors considered and adopted a revision to Apigee’s bylaws that establishes personal jurisdiction of
the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with certain actions brought by Apigee stockholders in a
court other than a court located in the State of Delaware. 

On September 6, 2016, the board of directors of Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent company, also met and approved the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. 

On the evening of September 7, 2016, the Company, Google and Merger Sub executed the Merger Agreement, and the parties to
the voting agreements executed the voting agreements.  Following the execution of the Merger Agreement, on the morning of
September 8, 2016 and prior to the opening of trading on NASDAQ, the Company issued a press release and Google issued a blog post
announcing the transaction. 

On September 12, 2016, in recognition that two members of the Board of Directors were unable to be present at the time the vote
was taken with respect to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the special meeting of the Board on
September 7, 2016, but desired to formalize their support of the Merger, there was a special meeting of the Board of Directors.  At the
meeting, the Board of Directors unanimously ratified the Board’s prior resolutions from September 7, 2016 (1) to determine that the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable; (2) to determine that the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of Apigee and its
stockholders; (3) to approve the execution and delivery of Merger Agreement, the performance by Apigee of its covenants and
obligations thereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; and (4) to resolve to
recommend that the stockholders of Apigee adopt the Merger Agreement.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger

Recommendation of the Board of Directors

The Board of Directors has unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, are advisable; (2) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of Apigee and its stockholders; (3) approved the execution
and delivery of Merger Agreement, the performance by Apigee of its covenants and obligations thereunder and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; and (4) resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger. 

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement; and (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. 

Reasons for the Merger

In evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Board of
Directors consulted with Apigee management, representatives of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel.  In recommending
that stockholders vote in favor of approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors considered a number of
factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily exhaustive or presented in order of relative importance):
 

 
•  the fact that the all-cash $17.40 Merger Consideration will provide certainty of value and liquidity to stockholders, while

eliminating the effect of long-term business and execution risk to stockholders;
 

 •  the thorough review of Apigee’s strategic and financial alternatives, including that:
 

 •  Apigee received an unsolicited offer from Party 1 for a strategic transaction;
 

 
•  24 different parties and potential buyers were invited to participate or were involved in the sales process over two

rounds of inquiries made by Morgan Stanley, including nine private equity sponsors and fifteen strategic buyers, in an
effort to obtain the best value reasonably available to stockholders;

 

 
•  of these parties, six strategic buyers and five private equity sponsors entered into non-disclosure agreements, of which

all but one ultimately met with Apigee’s management team to discuss Apigee’s business;
 

 

•  of the parties that made final and complete bids to acquire Apigee, none made a final bid in excess of the $17.40
Merger Consideration.  Party 1 declined to make a revised bid above their prior offer of $16.50 per share, Party 2
declined to offer in excess of $14.50 per share and Party 3 was unprepared to submit a bid over the course of five
weeks of discussions;

 

 
•  the risk that prolonging the strategic and financial alternatives process further could have resulted in the loss of a

favorable opportunity to successfully consummate the transaction with Google;
 

 •  the fact that Google would not need to obtain financing to close the Merger; and
 

 

•  the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of September 7, 2016, and based upon
and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on
the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written opinion, the consideration to be received
by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.  The full text of the written opinion is attached as
Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety.  The opinion
of Morgan Stanley is more fully described below under the heading “The Merger—Opinion of the Company’s
Financial Advisor,” beginning on page 47.

operations, financial prospects and condition, including its projected stand-alone financial performance embodied in the
Management Projections;

 

 

•  the perceived risks and benefits of a variety of strategic alternatives for Apigee, including (1) the continuation of Apigee’s

•  approximately 43.1% over the average closing price of Apigee’s common stock over the thirty (30) day trading period

as of August 2, 2016, the last trading date prior to the commencement of an unexplained run-up in the trading price of
Apigee’s common stock;

 

 •  the recent and historical market prices of Apigee’s common stock;
 

 
•  the Board of Directors’ belief, based on discussions and negotiations with Google, that the $17.40 Merger Consideration was

the highest price Google would be willing to pay per share of common stock;
 

 •  the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties to stockholders under Delaware law;

•  the fact that the Board of Directors believes that the company termination fee of $21,750,000 is reasonable, consistent

with fees in comparable transactions and not preclusive of other offers (see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”);

 

 
•  Apigee’s entitlement to the parent termination fee of $46,600,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under

certain circumstances (see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination
Fees” and “The Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger”);

shares of Apigee common stock;
 

 
•  the likelihood of satisfying the conditions to complete the Merger and the likelihood that the Merger will be

completed; and
 

 
•  the Board of Directors’ view that the Merger Agreement was the product of arm’s-length negotiation and contained

customary terms and conditions. 

The Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the following
(which factors are not necessarily exhaustive or presented in order of relative importance):
 

 
•  the risks that the Merger might not be completed due to the failure to obtain stockholder approval or failure to satisfy the

other conditions to the completion of the Merger, including receipt of required regulatory approvals;
 

 
•  the requirement that Apigee pay Google the company termination fee of $21,750,000 under certain circumstances following

termination of the Merger Agreement, including if the Board of Directors were to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept
a superior proposal (see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees”);

 

 
•  the fact that the requirement that Google pay Apigee the parent termination fee of $46,600,000 would not be available in all

circumstances in which the Merger Agreement might be terminated (see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger Agreement—Termination Fees” and “The Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger”);

 

 
•  the risks and costs associated with any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Apigee and others related to the

Merger Agreement;
 

 

•  the fact that the announcement and pendency of the Merger, or the failure to complete the Merger, may cause substantial
harm to Apigee’s relationships with its employees (including making it more difficult to attract and retain or recruit key
personnel and the possible loss of key management, technical, sales and other personnel), vendors and customers and may
divert management and employees’ attention away from Apigee’s business operations;

 

 
•  the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to Apigee’s stockholders that are U.S. persons for U.S. federal income

tax purposes;
 

 
•  the fact that stockholders would not participate in any future earnings or growth of Apigee and would not benefit from any

appreciation in value of Apigee, including any appreciation in value that could be realized as a result of the successful
execution of Apigee’s current strategy or improvements to our operations;

 

 
•  the possibility that Google could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including restructuring efforts, special

dividends or the sale of some or all of Apigee’s assets to one or more as yet unknown purchasers, that could conceivably
produce a higher aggregate value than that available to stockholders in the Merger;

Table of Contents

 
•  the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Apigee is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals during the

pendency of the Merger (see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Alternative Acquisition
Proposals”);

 

 

•  the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the Merger, including the requirement that we
conduct our business in the ordinary course, subject to specific limitations, which may delay or prevent Apigee from
undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the Merger and that, absent the Merger
Agreement, Apigee might have pursued;

 

 
•  potential uncertainty in the marketplace, which could lead current and prospective customers to purchase from other vendors

or delay purchasing from Apigee;
 

 
•  the significant costs, fees, expenses and charges involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and

completing the Merger;
 

 
•  other developments beyond the control of Apigee, including, but not limited to, changes in domestic or global economic

conditions that may affect the timing or success of the Merger;
 

 

•  the fact that the completion of the Merger will require antitrust clearance in the United States, Austria and Germany
(including that there may be conditions, limitations or restrictions placed on these approvals) and the risk that one or more
governmental entities may deny approval (see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Regulatory
Approvals Required for the Merger”);

 

 
•  the risk that Apigee’s business, sales operations and financial results could suffer in the event that the Merger is not

consummated;
 

 
•  the risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of termination of the

Merger Agreement on the trading price of Apigee common stock; and
 

 
•  the fact that Apigee’s directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to,

those of Apigee’s other stockholders (see below under the caption “—Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger”). 

The foregoing discussion is not meant to be exhaustive, but summarizes many of the material factors considered by the Board of
Directors in its consideration of the Merger.  After considering these and other factors, the Board of Directors concluded that the
potential benefits of the Merger outweighed the uncertainties and risks.  In view of the variety of factors considered by the Board of
Directors and the complexity of these factors, the Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise
assign relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its determination and recommendations.  Moreover, each member of the
Board of Directors applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different weights to
different factors. 

The Board of Directors adopted and approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and unanimously recommends that stockholders approve and adopt the Merger Agreement based upon the totality
of the information presented to and considered by the Board of Directors. 

Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor

The Company retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services and a financial opinion in connection with
the possible sale of the Company.  The Board of Directors selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on Morgan
Stanley’s qualifications, expertise and reputation, its knowledge of and involvement in the Company’s industry, and its knowledge and
understanding of the Company’s business and affairs.  In connection with the Merger, at the meeting of the Board of Directors on
September 7, 2016, Morgan Stanley rendered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of
September 7, 2016, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters

available to Morgan Stanley by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion.  Morgan Stanley further relied upon the
assurances of the Company’s management that it was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information
inaccurate or misleading.  With respect to the financial projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the Company’s management of the future financial
performance of the Company.  In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the
terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions and that the definitive
Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft furnished to Morgan Stanley.  Morgan Stanley assumed that,
in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the Merger, no
delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits
expected to be derived in the Merger.  Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor.  Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor
only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with
respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters.  Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of
the compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration
to be received by the holders of shares of the Company common stock in the Merger.  Morgan Stanley did not make any independent
valuation or appraisal of the Company’s assets or liabilities, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. 
Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, September 7, 2016.  Events occurring after September 7, 2016 may affect Morgan
Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or
reaffirm its opinion. 

Summary of Financial Analyses. 

The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and
the preparation of its written opinion letter dated September 7, 2016 to the Board of Directors.  The following summary is not a
complete description of Morgan Stanley’s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in
connection with its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those
analyses.  Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on
market data as it existed on or before September 7, 2016, the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors at
which Morgan Stanley rendered its opinion.  Some of the various analyses summarized below were based on the closing price of
$14.32 per share of the Company common stock as of August 15, 2016 (the last full trading day prior to the publication of a media
report that Apigee was considering a sale), and are not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.  Some of these summaries
of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format.  In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by
Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary.  The tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses.  The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole; considering
any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or
incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion. 

In performing the financial analysis summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley was directed by the
Company’s Board of Directors to use and rely upon certain financial projections provided by the Company’s management, which are
referred to below as “Management Case B” and referred to elsewhere in this proxy statement as the Case B Projections (as more fully
described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Management Projections.”  In addition, in performing the financial
analysis summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley used certain financial projections based on Wall Street research
reports and referred to below as the “Street Case.”

Public Trading Comparables Analysis. 

Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by
comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded.  Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared certain financial estimates for the
Company with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates for cloud software companies, selected based
on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, that share similar business characteristics and have certain comparable
operating characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue growth rates, market capitalization,
profitability, and/or similar operating characteristics (we refer to these companies as the comparable companies).  These comparable
companies were the following:

Next Generation Infrastructure Companies
 

 •  Red Hat Inc.
 

 •  Salesforce.com Inc.
 

 •  ServiceNow Inc.
 

 •  Splunk Inc.

Disruptive Software Companies
 

 •  Atlassian Corporation Plc
 

 •  Hortonworks, Inc.
 

 •  New Relic Inc.
 

 •  Tableau Software Inc.

Transitioning Software Companies
 

 •  Box Inc.
 

 •  Callidus Software Inc.
 

 •  FireEye, Inc.
 

 •  Xactly Corp. 

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its professional
judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of revenue multiples and applied these ranges of multiples to
the estimated calendar years 2016 and 2017 revenue for the Company, based on consensus Wall Street research. 

Based on the outstanding shares of the Company common stock on a fully diluted basis (including outstanding options, warrants
and restricted stock units) as provided by the Company’s management on September 2, 2016, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated
implied value per share of the Company common stock as of September 7, 2016 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the
Company’s Board of Directors at which Morgan Stanley rendered its opinion) as follows:
 

Consensus Estimated Revenue

Multiple Ranges   

Implied Value

Calendar Year 2016   3.0x – 6.0x   10.92 – 19.45

Morgan Stanley noted that the consideration to be received by holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than the
excluded shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is $17.40 per share. 

No company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to the Company.  In evaluating the comparable
companies, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, regulatory, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company’s control.  These include, among other
things, the impact of competition on the Company’s business and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any
adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company and the industry, and in the financial markets in
general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable
company data. 

For the companies listed above, Morgan Stanley observed the following:

Discounted Equity Value Analysis

Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the potential future equity
value of a company as a function of the company’s estimated future revenues.  The resulting equity value is subsequently discounted to
arrive at an estimate of the implied present value.  In connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied
present equity values per share of the Company common stock on a standalone basis.  As directed by the Company’s Board of
Directors, Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from Management Case B for purposes of its discounted equity value analysis, as more
fully described below.  To calculate the discounted equity value using Management Case B, Morgan Stanley used fiscal year 2018
revenue projections set forth in Management Case B provided by the Company’s management on July 20, 2016.  In addition, Morgan
Stanley calculated the discounted equity value using the Street Case.  Based upon the application of its professional judgment and
experience, Morgan Stanley applied a range of revenue multiples to these estimates and applied a discount rate of 11.9%, which rate
was used based on the Company’s estimated cost of equity as of September 7, 2016.  Morgan Stanley estimated the cost of equity of
11.93% for the Company by using the capital asset pricing model.  The inputs to the model consisted of: (1) a beta of 1.39, (2) a risk-
free rate of 1.54% and (3) a market premium of 6%.  In its calculation, Morgan Stanley used a Barra predicted beta and a risk-free rate
that was equal to the 10-year treasury rate.  A size adjustment of 2.04% was made.  These estimates were made by Morgan Stanley
upon application of its professional judgment and experience.

Morgan Stanley noted that the consideration to be received by holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than the
excluded shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is $17.40 per share. 

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by
calculating the present value of such company’s estimated future cash flows and the terminal value of such company.  Morgan Stanley
calculated a range of equity values per share for the Company common stock based on a discounted cash flow analysis to value the
Company as a standalone entity.  As directed by the Company’s Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley utilized estimates from
Management Case B for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below. 

Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flow which Morgan Stanley defined as adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, less (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2) taxes, and (3) capital expenditures, and
less or plus, as applicable, (4) changes in working capital. The Management Case B estimates through fiscal year 2021 were based on
projections prepared by the Company’s management, and the estimated unlevered free cash flow for fiscal years 2022 through 2026
were based on extrapolations of such estimates discussed with, and approved by, the Company’s management. Morgan Stanley
calculated the net present value of free cash flows for the Company for fiscal years 2017 through 2026.  Based on the perpetual growth
rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.5%, selected based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley
calculated terminal values in the year 2026.  In addition, Morgan Stanley performed an analysis taking into account the impact of the
Company’s existing net operating losses (“NOLs”).  The free cash flows and terminal values were discounted to present values as of
July 31, 2016 at discount rates ranging from 10.9% to 12.9%, which discount rates were selected, upon the application of Morgan
Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital as of
September 7, 2016.  Morgan Stanley estimated the cost of equity for the Company by using the capital asset pricing model.  The inputs
to the model consisted of: (1) a beta of 1.39, (2) a risk-free rate of 1.54% and (3) a market premium of 6%.  The cost of equity range of
10.93% to 12.93% was calculated, based on the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, by adding and
subtracting 100 basis points to the calculated cost of equity of 11.93%.  In its calculation, Morgan Stanley used a Barra predicted beta
and a risk-free rate that was equal to the 10-year treasury rate.  A size adjustment of 2.04% was made.  Using a post-tax cost of debt of
4.55% and a debt to total capitalization rate of 0.4%, Morgan Stanley calculated a weighted cost of capital range of 10.90% to 12.90%. 
These estimates were made by Morgan Stanley upon application of its professional judgment and experience. 

Based on the Company’s cash balance as reflected in the Company’s July 31, 2016 balance sheet and the outstanding shares of the
Company common stock on a fully diluted basis (including outstanding options, warrants and restricted stock units) as provided by the
Company’s management as of September 2, 2016, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of the Company
common stock as of July 31, 2016 as follows:

Morgan Stanley noted that the consideration to be received by holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than the
excluded shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is $17.40 per share. 

Precedent Transactions Analysis

Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company based on publicly
available financial terms and premia of selected transactions that share some characteristics with the Merger.  Morgan Stanley
compared publicly available statistics for technology cloud software transactions, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional
judgment and experience and familiarity with the Company’s industry, with an equity value between $500 million and $5 billion
occurring in 2016 up to September 7, 2016 (the last full trading day prior to the meeting of the Company’s Board of Directors at which
Morgan Stanley rendered its opinion).  Morgan Stanley selected such comparable transactions because they shared certain
characteristics with the Merger, most notably because the transactions involved similar companies in the software industry.  The
following is a list of the software transactions reviewed:

Selected Cloud and Software Transactions (Target / Acquiror):

Cvent Inc. / Vista Equity Partners
Textura Corp. / Oracle Corporation
Opower Inc. / Oracle Corporation

Marketo Inc. / Vista Equity Partners
Demandware Inc. / Salesforce.com Inc.
Qlik Technologies Inc. / Thoma Bravo

AVG Technologies C.Z. s.r.o. / Avast Software s.r.o.
Imprivata Inc. / Thoma Bravo

LogMeIn Inc. / Citrix Systems Inc.
Fleetmatics USA Inc. / Verizon Communications Inc.

For the transactions listed above, Morgan Stanley noted the aggregate value of the transaction as a multiple to the next twelve
months’ revenue, based on publicly available information and the Street Case based on Wall Street research. 

For the transactions listed above, Morgan Stanley observed the following:
 

Target   Acquiror  NTM Revenue Multiple
Cvent Inc.   Vista Equity Partners  6.5x

Textura Corp.   Oracle Corporation  6.3x
Opower Inc.   Oracle Corporation  3.3x
Marketo Inc.   Vista Equity Partners  5.9x

Demandware Inc.   Salesforce.com Inc.  9.1x
Qlik Technologies Inc.   Thoma Bravo  3.5x

AVG Technologies C.Z. s.r.o.   Avast Software s.r.o.  3.0x
Imprivata Inc.   Thoma Bravo  3.5x
LogMeIn Inc.   Citrix Systems Inc.  5.9x

Fleetmatics USA Inc.   Verizon Communications Inc.  6.3x

Morgan Stanley also reviewed 123 precedent transactions occurring between 2011 and September 7, 2016, which involved U.S.
publicly listed companies in the technology sector and which had a transaction value of greater than $250 million and all-cash
consideration.  For these transactions, Morgan Stanley noted the distributions of the following financial statistics, where available:
(1) the implied premium to the acquired company’s closing share price on the last trading day prior to announcement (or the last
trading day prior to the

share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news); (2) the implied premium to the acquired company’s
30-trading-day average closing share price prior to announcement (or the last 30-trading-day average closing share price prior to the
share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news); (3) the implied premium to the acquired company’s
60-trading-day average closing share price prior to announcement (or the last 60-trading-day average closing share price prior to the
share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news); and (4) the implied premium to the acquired
company’s 90-trading-day average closing share price prior to announcement (or the last 90-trading-day average closing share price
prior to the share price being affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news). 

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics and time frame for each of the transactions listed above and upon the application of
its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of implied premia and financial multiples of
the transactions and applied these ranges of premia and financial multiples to the relevant financial statistic for the Company.  The
following table summarizes Morgan Stanley’s analysis:

Premium to 90-Day Average Closing Share  Price    28% – 54%      14.60 – 17.55   

Morgan Stanley noted that the consideration to be received by holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than the
excluded shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is $17.40 per share. 

No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to the Company or the Merger.  In
evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company’s control. 
These include, among other things, the impact of competition on the Company’s business and the industry generally, industry growth,
and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company and the industry, and in the
financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value and equity value of
the transactions to which the Company and the Merger are being compared.  The fact that points in the range of implied present value
per share of Company common stock derived from the valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the
consideration for the Merger is not necessarily dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the consideration for the
Merger, but one of many factors Morgan Stanley considered. 

Other Information

Morgan Stanley observed additional factors that were not considered part of Morgan Stanley’s financial analysis with respect to
its opinion, but which were noted as reference data for the Board of Directors, including the following information described under the
sections titled “Trading Range” and “Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets.”

Trading Range

Morgan Stanley noted the trading range with respect to the historical share prices of the Company common stock.  Morgan
Stanley reviewed the range of closing prices of the Company common stock for various periods ending on August 15, 2016 (the last
full trading day prior to the publication of a media report that Apigee was considering a sale).  Morgan Stanley observed the following:
 

Period Prior to August 15, 2016   Range of Trading Prices ($)
Last Month (7/15/16 – 8/15/16)   11.72 – 14.88
Last Three Months (5/15/16 – 8/15/16)   10.55 – 14.88
Last Six Months (2/15/16 – 8/15/16)     5.65 – 14.88
Last Twelve Months (8/15/15 – 8/15/16)     5.45 – 14.88

Morgan Stanley noted that the consideration to be received by holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than the
excluded shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is $17.40 per share.

Morgan Stanley observed that the Company common stock closed at $14.32 per share on August 15, 2016 (the last full trading
day prior to the publication of a media report that Apigee was considering a sale).  Morgan Stanley noted that the consideration per
share of the Company common stock of $17.40 pursuant to the Merger Agreement reflected a 21.5% premium to the closing price per
share of the Company common stock on August 15, 2016, a 37.0% premium to the average closing price per share of the Company
common stock for the 30 trading days prior to and including August 15, 2016, a 42.3% premium to the average closing price per share
of the Company common stock for the 60 trading days prior to and including August 15, 2016 (which figure was revised from 58.8%
cited in the materials delivered to the Board of Directors, which was the spot premium from the 60th trading day prior to August 15,
2016), a 52.3% premium to the average closing price per share of the Company common stock for the 90 trading days prior to and
including August 15, 2016 (which figure was revised from 89.1% cited in the materials delivered to the Board of Directors, which was
the spot premium from the 90th trading day prior to August 15, 2016), and a 16.9% premium to the highest closing price per share of
the Company common stock for the twelve months prior to and including August 15, 2016.  Morgan Stanley also observed that the
Company common stock closed at $12.30 per share on August 2, 2016 (the last full trading day prior to an unexplained run-up in the
trading price of the Company common stock).  Morgan Stanley noted that the consideration per share of the Company common stock
of $17.40 pursuant to the Merger Agreement reflected a 41.5% premium to the closing price per share of the Company common stock
on August 2, 2016, a 43.1% premium to the average closing price per share of the Company common stock for the 30 trading days
prior to and including August 2, 2016, a 48.9% premium to the average closing price per share of the Company common stock for the
60 trading days prior to and including August 2, 2016, a 59.6% premium to the average closing price per share of the Company
common stock for the 90 trading days prior to and including August 2, 2016, and a 34.3% premium to the highest closing price per
share of the Company common stock for the twelve months prior to and including August 2, 2016. 

Equity Research Analysts’ Future Price Targets

Morgan Stanley reviewed future public market trading price targets for the Company common stock prepared and published by
equity research analysts from March 23, 2016 to August 17, 2016.  These one-year forward targets reflected each analyst’s estimate of
the future public market trading price of the Company common stock.  The range of undiscounted analyst price targets for the
Company common stock was $14.00 to $19.00 per share.  The range of analyst price targets per share for the Company common stock
discounted for one year at a rate of 11.9%, such discount rate selected by Morgan Stanley upon the application of its professional
judgment and experience, to reflect the Company’s cost of equity as of September 7, 2016, was $12.51 to $16.98 per share.

Table of Contents

The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading
prices for the Company common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of
the Company and future financial market conditions. 

General

In connection with the review of the Merger by the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and
comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion.  The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description.  In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of
all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered.  Morgan Stanley
believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the
process underlying its analyses and opinion.  In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less
weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions.  As a
result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley’s view
of the actual value of the Company.  In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
Company’s control.  These include, among other things, the impact of competition on the Company’s business and the industry
generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company
and the industry, and in the financial markets in general.  Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily
indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. 

Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial point of view
of the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to the
Merger Agreement and in connection with the delivery of its opinion, dated September 7, 2016, to the Board of Directors.  These
analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of the Company common stock might actually trade. 

The consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than excluded shares) pursuant to
the Merger Agreement was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between the Company and Google and was approved by the
Board of Directors.  Morgan Stanley provided advice to the Board of Directors during these negotiations but did not, however,
recommend any specific consideration to the Company or the Board of Directors, nor did Morgan Stanley opine that any specific
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.  Morgan Stanley’s opinion did not address the relative
merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives
could be achieved or are available.  Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute an opinion or
recommendation as to whether the stockholders of the Company should take any action in connection with the Merger nor as to how
the stockholders of the Company should vote at any stockholders’ meeting that may be held in connection with the Merger. 

Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the
Company’s Board of Directors in deciding to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, declare the advisability of the Merger and
approve the transactions contemplated thereby.  Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative
of the opinion of the Company’s Board of Directors with respect to the consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement or of whether
the Company’s Board of Directors would have been willing to agree to different consideration.  Morgan Stanley’s opinion was
approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with Morgan Stanley’s
customary practice. 

The Board of Directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, experience and expertise.  Morgan
Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment

management and individual wealth management businesses.  Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and
brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment
banking, financing and financial advisory services.  Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a
principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and
effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of their customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Google and its
affiliates, the Company, or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related
derivative instrument. 

Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Board of Directors with financial advisory services and a
financial opinion, described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, in connection with the Merger, and the
Company has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $12.4 million (the “Transaction Fee”) for its services,
approximately $9.3 million of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger and $3.1 million (the “Announcement Fee”) of
which has already been paid following the execution of the Merger Agreement.  In addition, in the event the Merger is not completed
and the Company receives a reverse termination fee from Parent in connection with such termination, Morgan Stanley would be
entitled to receive a fee equal to twenty five percent (25%) of such reverse termination fee, provided that such amount will not exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the total Transaction Fee which would otherwise have been payable to Morgan Stanley and against which the
Announcement Fee will be credited.  The Company has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable expenses, including
fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement.  In addition, the Company has
agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each other
person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses, relating to, arising out of or in
connection with Morgan Stanley’s engagement. 

In the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley has provided equity underwriting services for the Company for
which it was paid approximately $2.1 million.  In the period from August 30, 2014 to August 30, 2016, the Institutional Securities
Group of Morgan Stanley (“Morgan Stanley ISG”), provided services to Alphabet Inc. (“Alphabet”), the parent holding company of
Google, for which it was paid approximately $9.6 million.  The services that Morgan Stanley ISG provided to Alphabet to earn these
fees included (1) debt underwriting and (2) other miscellaneous financing services.  Morgan Stanley may seek to provide financial
advisory and financing services to Alphabet, Google and the Company and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to
receive fees for the rendering of these services. 

Management Projections

Apigee does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose long-term projections as to its future financial performance. However, in
connection with Apigee’s consideration of its strategic alternatives (including continuation as a stand-alone enterprise) and subsequent
negotiation of the Merger during the summer of 2016, at the request of the Board of Directors, Apigee management prepared two sets
of financial projections for fiscal years 2017-2021, each of which was presented to the Board of Directors at meetings in July 2016
(individually, the “Case A Projections” and the “Case B Projections,” and collectively, the “Management Projections”).  The
Management Projections were subsequently provided to representatives of Morgan Stanley and representatives of Google, and the Case
A Projections were provided to certain other potential bidders, including Party 1, Party 2 and Party 3.

The Case A Projections assume that the Company will execute to all expectations with minimal execution risk.  As detailed under
the section captioned “—Background of the Merger” beginning on page 33, following a request from the Board of Directors, Apigee
management prepared a second set of financial projections in the same manner as the Case A Projections, except with certain
adjustments to reflect revised assumptions and related sensitivities related to risks faced by the Company’s business, including
execution risks, pricing compression due to increased competition and lower average sales price, the continued impact of Brexit and

related challenges in the EMEA region, demand changes in the financial services market, and modest gains in sales productivity, and
therefore represent a case that Apigee management and the Board of Directors considered more likely to be achieved (and represent a
more realistic assessment of the Company’s anticipated future performance) than the Case A Projections. 

The Management Projections were the only financial forecasts with respect to Apigee provided by Apigee for use by its financial
advisors in performing their financial analyses during the strategic and financial review process.  The Management Projections were
not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy statement because the Management Projections were made
available to the Board of Directors, Morgan Stanley and Google and its representatives in Apigee’s strategic and financial review
process and in connection with Google’s due diligence review of Apigee.  The Management Projections were also made available to
Morgan Stanley for use in connection with their provision of financial advisory services as described in this proxy statement.  As
described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “—Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor”, the Board of Directors
instructed Morgan Stanley to use the Case B Projections in connection with its fairness opinion, as the Board of Directors had
determined that the Case B Projections were more likely to reflect the future business performance of Apigee on a stand-alone basis
than would the Case A Projections. 

The Management Projections were not prepared with a view to compliance with (1) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(“GAAP”); (2) the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements; or (3) the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial
information.  KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accountant, has not examined, reviewed, compiled or otherwise applied
procedures to the Management Projections and, accordingly, assumes no responsibility for, and expresses no opinion on, them.  The
Management Projections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by Apigee management. 

Although a summary of the Management Projections is presented with numerical specificity, they reflect numerous assumptions
and estimates as to future events made by Apigee management, taking into account the relevant information available to Apigee
management at the time.  This information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future
results.  Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Management Projections not to be achieved include general
economic conditions, Apigee’s ability to achieve forecasted sales, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or
projected cash flows, competitive pressures and changes in tax laws.  In addition, the Management Projections do not take into account
any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the Merger.  As a result, there can
be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those
contained in the Management Projections.  The Management Projections cover multiple years, and such information by its nature
becomes less reliable with each successive year.  The inclusion of the Management Projections in this proxy statement should not be
regarded as an indication that the Board of Directors, Apigee, Morgan Stanley, Google or any of their respective affiliates or
representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Management Projections to be predictive of
actual future results.  The summary of the Management Projections is not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any
stockholder to vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, nor
any of the other proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting.  We do not intend to update or otherwise revise the Management
Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date when they were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even
in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Management Projections are shown to be in error or no longer
appropriate.  In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Management Projections, stockholders are
cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the projections included in this proxy statement. 

The Management Projections and the accompanying tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP
gross profit, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization

(“Adjusted EBITDA”), and unlevered free cash flow, which Apigee believes are helpful in understanding the Management Projections
and which were presented to the Board of Directors and used by Morgan Stanley to perform various financial analyses requested by the
Board.  The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP
measures and should be read in conjunction with Apigee’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, which
are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, and the reconciliation to GAAP measures presented herein. Due to the forward-
looking nature of the Management Projections, specific quantifications of the amounts that would be required to reconcile it to GAAP
measures are not available.  Apigee’s management regularly uses Apigee’s supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to
understand and manage the business and forecast future periods. 

The Management Projections are forward-looking statements.  For information on factors that may cause Apigee’s actual future
results to materially vary from the Management Projections, see the information under the section captioned “Forward-Looking
Statements”.

Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to approve and adopt the
Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from,
or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s stockholders generally, as more fully described below.  The Board of Directors was
aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters, in approving the Merger
Agreement and the Merger and recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the Company’s stockholders.  The
consummation of the Merger will constitute a “change in control,” a “change of control” and/or any term of similar meaning.

hand, and any indemnified persons (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on the other hand.  In addition, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Google will cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of Apigee and its subsidiaries as of the date of the
Merger Agreement, and during such six-year period such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner except as required by applicable law; and

 

 

•  the Merger Agreement also provides that prior to the Effective Time, Apigee may (and, if Google requests, will) purchase,
following reasonable consultation with Google, a six year prepaid “tail” policy of officers and directors liability insurance. 
If Apigee does not purchase a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, for at least six years after the Effective Time, Google
will cause the Surviving Corporation and its other subsidiaries to maintain in full force and effect, on substantially similar
terms and conditions to the current or former directors and officers of Apigee and its subsidiaries, the existing directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary insurance maintained by Apigee as of the date of the Merger Agreement.  The
“tail” policy will cover claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time,
including the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement.  The obligation of Google or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, is subject to an annual premium cap of 250% of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid by Apigee for
such coverage for its last full fiscal year.  For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance.”

Table of Contents

At the Effective Time, each company option (whether vested or unvested) with a per share exercise price that equals or exceeds
$17.40 will be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration. 

At the Effective Time, and except as provided above, each vested company option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the excess
of (1) $17.40 over (2) the per share exercise price of such vested company option multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of
common stock issuable upon the exercise of such vested company option (the “vested option consideration”).  As soon as practicable
(and in no event more than 30 calendar days) following the Closing Date, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each
holder of a vested company option the vested option consideration (if any), less applicable taxes. 

At the Effective Time, and except as provided above, each unvested company option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be assumed and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the excess of (1) $17.40 over (2) the per share exercise price of such unvested company option multiplied by (y) the total number of
shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such unvested company option (the “unvested option consideration”), with
payment of the unvested option consideration, less applicable taxes, to be made in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to
such unvested company option immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that such holder remains employed by or otherwise
in service to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective subsidiaries on each applicable vesting date, subject to the terms and
conditions of the unvested payment plan.

In addition, each executive officer is eligible to receive immediate vesting of 100% of his or her outstanding company options
under his or her Company offer letter (as defined below) upon a termination of employment by the Company or its successor without
cause (excluding by reason of death or disability) or by the individual for good reason, in either case, within the period beginning one
month preceding, and ending 12 months following the Merger, as described more fully below.  Similarly, the Google offer letters with
each of Messrs.  Kapoor, Jhingran and Ramaswamy, which will supersede their Company offer letters upon the Closing Date, provide
that each such executive officer is eligible to receive immediate vesting of 100% of his outstanding unvested option consideration upon
a termination of employment by the Company or Google without cause or by the individual for good reason, in either case, within the
first 12 months following the Merger. 

Please see “The Merger—Equity Interests of Apigee’s Executive Officers and Non-Employee Directors,” for additional
information regarding the company options held by the executives and the non-employee members of the Board of Directors. 

Treatment of Restricted Stock Units

As of October 7, 2016, there were 2,287,864 outstanding restricted stock units, of which 332,750 were held by our directors and
executive officers. 

At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit held by an individual who is an active employee of the Company or its
subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed and
converted into GSUs in respect of that number of shares of Alphabet Class C Capital Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Company common stock underlying such restricted stock units multiplied by (2) the
stock award exchange ratio.  Each such GSU will continue to have, and will continue to be subject to, the same terms and conditions,
including vesting terms and continued service requirements, as applied to the restricted stock unit prior to the Effective Time (but,
taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the Company employee benefits plans or in the underlying award agreement by
reason of the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby). 

For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “stock award exchange ratio” means the quotient obtained by dividing (1) $17.40 by
(2) the volume-weighted average trading price of Alphabet’s Class C Capital Stock for a five trading day period, starting with the
opening of trading on the seventh trading day prior to the Closing Date.

consideration”).  As soon as practicable (and in no event more than 30 calendar days following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder of restricted stock units the restricted stock unit consideration, less any applicable taxes. 

At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit held by (1) a person other than an individual described in the foregoing two
paragraphs or (2) any non-employee member of the Board of Directors or any consultant or independent contractor to the Company or
its subsidiaries which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest and be settled in Company common stock and

rights under the ESPP will automatically be exercised upon the earlier of (1) a date prior to the Effective Time (but not later than 10
business days before the Effective Time) and (2) the purchase date of the current purchase period in progress, and the ESPP will
terminate as of the Effective Time.  No new purchase periods will begin under the ESPP on or after September 7, 2016, and ESPP
participants will not be permitted to increase the rate of payroll contributions or make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP
after September 7, 2016.  All shares of common stock purchased under the ESPP and held by an individual as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

Payments to Executives Upon Termination Following Change in Control

Offer Letters with Chet Kapoor, Tim Wan, Stacey Giamalis, Anant Jhingran and Shankar Ramaswamy

The Company has entered into confirmatory employment letters (each, a “Company offer letter”) with each of Messrs. Kapoor,
Wan, Jhingran and Ramaswamy and Ms. Giamalis that provide that upon the termination of the individual’s employment by the
Company or its successor without “cause” (excluding by reasons of death or “disability”) or by the individual for “good reason” (each,
an “involuntary termination”), each of Messrs. Kapoor, Wan, Jhingran and Ramaswamy and Ms. Giamalis will receive the following
severance payments and benefits:
 

 
•  a lump-sum payment payable on the 60th day following termination of employment equal to 12 months (in the case of

Mr. Kapoor) or nine months (in the case of Messrs. Wan, Jhingran and Ramaswamy and Ms. Giamalis) of his or her base
salary as in effect on the termination date; and

 

 

•  reimbursement of COBRA premiums for the individual and his or her eligible dependents for up to 12 months (in the case of
Mr. Kapoor) and up to nine months (in the case of Messrs. Wan, Jhingran and Ramaswamy and Ms. Giamalis), or, in the
event that reimbursing such costs would result in an excise tax to Apigee, payment of an amount equal to $30,000 (in the
case of Mr. Kapoor) or $22,500 (in the case of Messrs. Wan, Jhingran and Ramaswamy and Ms. Giamalis), payable in a
lump-sum on the 60th day following termination of employment. 

In the event that an involuntary termination occurs within the period beginning one month preceding, and ending 12 months
following a “change in control”, each of Messrs. Kapoor, Wan, Jhingran and Ramaswamy and Ms. Giamalis will also be entitled to full
vesting as to 100% of his or her outstanding equity awards. 

The receipt of any severance payments and benefits is conditioned on the individual executing a general release and waiver of
claims against the Company (or its successor). 

In all cases, in the event of any potential exposure to excise taxes under Section 280G or 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the
Company offer letters provide that such payments and benefits either will be paid in full or reduced to a level such that the excise taxes
are not imposed, whichever provides a better after-tax result for the executive officer.  No tax gross-ups are provided for under the
Company offer letters. 

For purposes of the Company offer letters, the term “cause” means the occurrence of one or more of the following, as reasonably
determined by the Board of Directors or its Compensation Committee, as applicable:
 

 
•  the individual’s failure to perform one or more of his or her material duties and responsibilities to the Company or its

successor after notice and an opportunity to cure of up to 15 business days following the date he or she receives notice;
 

 •  the individual’s refusal or failure to follow lawful directions of his or her manager;
 

 
•  the individual’s violation of any material policy of the Company or its successor, the Company offer letter, the Proprietary

Information and Inventions Agreement the individual previously signed with the Company or any other written agreement
or covenant with the Company or its successor;

 

 

•  the individual’s unauthorized use or disclosure of any material proprietary information or trade secrets that the individual
knows or reasonably should know constitute proprietary information or trade secrets, of the Company, its successor, or any
other party to whom the individual owes an obligation of nondisclosure as a result of his or her relationship with the
Company or its successor;

•  the individual’s conviction of, or plea of guilty or no contest to: (1) any felony under the laws of the United States or any

state thereof, (2) any crime involving fraud, dishonesty, theft or moral turpitude, or (3) any other conduct detrimental to the
Company or its successor or the reputation of the Company or its successor; or

 

 
•  the individual’s participation in or commission of a fraud, act of dishonesty, or any other action against the Company or its

successor that results in or is reasonably likely to result in material harm to the business or reputation of the Company or its
successor. 

For purposes of the Company offer letters, the term “change in control” means the occurrence of any of the following events:
 

 

•  a change in the ownership of the Company which occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as
a group (“person”), acquires ownership of the stock of the Company that, together with the stock held by such person,
constitutes more than 50% of the total voting power of the stock of the Company; provided, however, that for purposes of
this subsection, the acquisition of additional stock by any one person, who is considered to own more than 50% of the total
voting power of the stock of the Company will not be considered a change in control.  Further, if the stockholders of the
Company immediately before such change in ownership continue to retain immediately after the change in ownership, in
substantially the same proportions as their ownership of shares of the Company’s voting stock immediately prior to the
change in ownership, direct or indirect beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the total voting power of the stock of the
Company or of the ultimate parent entity of the Company, such event shall not be considered a change in control under this
subsection.  For this purpose, indirect beneficial ownership shall include, without limitation, an interest resulting from
ownership of the voting securities of one or more corporations or other business entities which own the Company, as the
case may be, either directly or through one or more subsidiary corporations or other business entities; or

 

 

•  a change in the effective control of the Company which occurs on the date that a majority of members of the Board of
Directors is replaced during any 12- month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority
of the members of the Board of Directors prior to the date of the appointment or election.  For purposes of this subsection, if
any person is considered to be in effective control of the Company, the acquisition of additional control of the Company by
the same person will not be considered a change in control; or

 

 

•  a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Company’s assets which occurs on the date that any person acquires
(or has acquired during the 12- month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons)
assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 50% of the total gross fair market
value of all of the assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions; provided, however, that for
purposes of this subsection, the following will not constitute a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the
Company’s assets: (1) a transfer to an entity that is controlled by the Company’s stockholders immediately after the transfer,
or (2) a transfer of assets by the Company to: (a) a stockholder of the Company (immediately before the asset transfer) in
exchange for or with respect to the Company’s stock, (b) an entity, 50% or more of the total value or voting power of which
is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, (c) a person, that owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the total
value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the Company, or (d) an entity, at least 50% of the total value or voting
power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in clause (2)(c).  For purposes of this subsection,
gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of,
determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets. 

For purposes of this definition, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters
into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with the Company.

Table of Contents

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed a change in control under the Company offer letters unless the
transaction qualifies as a change in control event within the meaning of Code Section 409A, as it has been and may be amended from
time to time, and any proposed or final Treasury Regulations and Internal Revenue Service guidance that has been promulgated or may
be promulgated thereunder from time to time. 

Further and for the avoidance of doubt, a transaction will not constitute a change in control under the Company offer letters if:
(1) its sole purpose is to change the state of the Company’s incorporation, or (2) its sole purpose is to create a holding company that
will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the persons who held the Company’s securities immediately before such
transaction. 

For purposes of the Company offer letters, “disability” means a condition that renders the individual unable to engage in
substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in
death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, as determined by the Board of Directors or its
Compensation Committee. 

For purposes of the Company offer letters, “good reason” means the individual’s resignation of his or her employment within
30 days following the notice and cure period discussed below following the occurrence of one or more of the following without the
individual’s written consent:
 

 
•  a material adverse change in the individual’s duties and responsibilities; provided, however, that in the event his or her duties

and responsibilities to the Company or its successor remain the same but the Company becomes part of a larger entity as part
of the change in control, such change in and of itself shall not constitute good reason;

 

 
•  a material reduction of the individual’s base salary (except where there is a reduction applicable to the management team

generally); provided, however, that a reduction in the individual’s base salary of 10% or less in any one-year will not be
deemed a material reduction; or

 

 

•  a material change in the geographic location of the individual’s primary work location; provided, that for Messrs. Kapoor,
Wan, Jhingran and Ramaswamy, a relocation of less than 50 miles from the individual’s work location in San Jose,
California, or to the individual’s home as his or her primary work location, will not be considered a material change in
geographic location, and provided, that, for Ms. Giamalis, an office relocation that makes the Company more accessible to
or of comparable accessibility to Ms. Giamalis’ home address (at the time she entered into the Company offer letter) will not
be considered a material change in geographic location. 

Within the 30-day period immediately following such event(s), the individual must first notify the Company or its successor of
the initial occurrence of the event(s) constituting good reason and that the individual is electing to terminate his or her employment
relationship with the Company or its successor for good reason if the Company fails to cure such event.  The Company or its successor
shall have a 30-day period to cure such event.  If the Company or its successor affects a cure within such period, the individual shall
not be eligible to terminate for good reason. 

The value of any triggered payments and benefits under their respective Company offer letters for our named executive officers
are set forth in the sections of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” and “The Merger—Equity Interests of Apigee’s Executive Officers and Non-Employee
Directors.”  In addition, the value of the severance payments (base salary and COBRA) under the Company offer letters for
Ms. Giamalis and Mr. Jhingran equals $227,801 and $235,301, respectively.  Please see “The Merger—Equity Interests of Apigee’s
Executive Officers and Non-Employee Directors” for a summary of the equity acceleration Ms. Giamalis and Mr. Jhingran will receive
upon a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the Merger.

equal installments starting on the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date and each successive annual anniversary thereafter, subject
to Mr. Kapoor, through each applicable vesting date (1) remaining actively and continuously employed, (2) remaining in good
standing, defined as performing at a level determined by Google to consistently meets expectations or better, and (3) not materially
breaching his At-Will Employment, Confidential Information, Invention Assignment and Arbitration Agreement with Google. 

If Mr. Kapoor’s employment with Google is terminated within the first 12 months after the Closing Date (1) by Google without
“cause” or (2) by Mr. Kapoor for “good reason”, any unvested option consideration and any restricted stock units that were assumed
and converted into GSUs will fully vest and become payable. Additionally, upon such termination, and subject to Mr. Kapoor
executing a general release and waiver of claims against Google, he will be eligible to receive (a) a lump-sum payment equal to six
months of his base salary as in effect on the termination date, less applicable withholdings, and (b) reimbursement of his costs to
continue his health care coverage under COBRA for six months for Mr. Kapoor and his eligible dependents. 

Upon approval by the Alphabet Board of Directors (or its designee), Mr. Kapoor will be eligible to receive the following grants of
GSUs, subject to the consummation of the Merger, a Closing Date no later than January 1, 2017, and Mr. Kapoor’s acceptance of
Google’s employment offer and continued employment on the applicable grant date:
 

 

•  The first grant of GSUs will entitle Mr. Kapoor to that number of GSUs determined by dividing $1,500,000 (the “Kapoor
target grant value”) by the closing price of a share of Alphabet Class C Capital Stock on the Tuesday immediately preceding
the grant date (intended to be January 4, 2017), rounded up to the nearest full GSU (the “first Kapoor GSU grant”).  The first
Kapoor GSU grant will vest in equal monthly installments over 12 consecutive months on the 25th day of each month until
the GSUs are fully vested, starting with the month of grant and subject to continued employment on such vesting dates.  The
Kapoor target grant value will be increased by $104,167, and the vesting period will be extended by one month, for each 30-
day period prior to January 1, 2017 that the Closing Date occurs and will be decreased by $104,167 and the vesting period
will be decreased by one month, for each 30-day period after January 1, 2017 that the Closing Date occurs. 

 

 

•  The second grant of GSUs will entitle Mr. Kapoor to that number of GSUs determined by dividing $1,500,000 by the
closing price of a share of Alphabet Class C Capital Stock on the Tuesday immediately preceding the grant date (intended to
be January 4, 2017), rounded up to the nearest full GSU (the “second Kapoor GSU grant”).  The second Kapoor GSU grant
will vest in equal monthly installments over 12 consecutive months on the 25th day of each month until the GSUs are fully
vested, starting on January 1, 2018 and subject to continued employment on such vesting dates. 

 

 

•  The third grant of GSUs will entitle Mr. Kapoor to that number of GSUs determined by dividing $1,500,000 by the closing
price of a share of Alphabet Class C Capital Stock on the Tuesday immediately preceding the grant date (intended to be
January 3, 2018), rounded up to the nearest full GSU (the “third Kapoor GSU grant”).  The third Kapoor GSU grant will

installments with 1/12th of the GSUs vesting on January 25, 2019 and an additional 1/12th of the GSUs vesting on the 25th
day of each month thereafter until the GSUs are fully vested, subject to continued employment on such vesting dates. 

For purposes of the Kapoor Google offer letter, “cause” will have substantially the same meaning as such term is defined in the
Company offer letter, except that references to the Company therein will refer to Google. 

For purposes of the Kapoor Google offer letter, “good reason” will mean Mr. Kapoor’s resignation of his employment within 30
days following the notice and cure period discussed below following the occurrence of one or more of the following without his written
consent:
 

 
•  a material reduction of Mr. Kapoor’s base salary (except where there is a reduction applicable to the management team

generally); provided, however, that a reduction in base salary of 10% or less in any one-year will not be deemed a material
reduction, or

 

 
•  a material change in the geographic location of Mr. Kapoor’s primary work location; provided, that a relocation of fewer

than 50 miles from his work location in San Jose, California, or to his home as his primary work location, will not be
considered a material change in geographic location. 

Within the 30-day period immediately following such event(s), Mr. Kapoor must first notify Google or its successor of the initial
occurrence of the event(s) constituting good reason and that he is electing to terminate his employment relationship with Google or its
successor for good reason if Google fails to cure such event.  Google or its successor shall have a 30-day period to cure such event.  If
Google or its successor effects a cure within such period, Mr. Kapoor will not be eligible to terminate for good reason. 

Under the Kapoor Google offer letter, Mr. Kapoor agrees that the Merger and the related changes to his compensation, benefits,
duties, responsibilities or reporting obligations set forth in his Kapoor Google offer letter will not by itself constitute good reason under
his Company offer letter or any other plan or agreement entered into with the Company or its affiliates which contain such term or any
substantially similar term. 

In all cases, in the event of any potential exposure to excise taxes under Section 280G or 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the
Kapoor Google offer letter provides that such payments and benefits either will be paid in full or reduced to a level such that the excise
taxes are not imposed, whichever provides a better after-tax result for the executive officer.  No tax gross-up is provided for under the
Kapoor Google offer letter. 

Google Offer Letter with Anant Jhingran

On September 7, 2016, Mr. Jhingran and Google entered into an offer letter (the “Jhingran Google offer letter”) that, effective as
of the Closing Date, will supersede and replace Mr. Jhingran’s Company offer letter. The Jhingran Google offer letter provides that
upon and subject to the closing of the Merger, Mr. Jhingran will be employed as Director, Product Management with an annual salary
of $318,000 and an annual bonus target of 40% of his annual salary. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Jhingran Google offer letter, Mr. Jhingran will be eligible to receive a retention bonus of $1,000,000
(the “Jhingran stay bonus”), less applicable deductions and tax withholding.  The Jhingran stay bonus will vest and be payable in four
equal installments starting on the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date and each successive annual anniversary thereafter, subject
to Mr. Jhingran, through each applicable vesting date (1) remaining actively and continuously employed, (2) remaining in good
standing, defined as performing at a level determined by Google to consistently meets expectations or better, and (3) not materially
breaching his At-Will Employment, Confidential Information, Invention Assignment and Arbitration Agreement. Additionally, Google
will pay Mr. Jhingran a one-time sign-on bonus of $50,000 (the “Jhingran sign-on bonus”), less applicable deductions and tax
withholdings, within 30 days following his start date with Google.  If Mr. Jhingran’s employment with Google ends within 12 months
following his start date, Mr. Jhingran must repay the Jhingran sign-on bonus on a prorated basis.

If Mr. Jhingran’s employment with Google is terminated within the first 12 months after the Closing Date (1) without “cause” or

under COBRA for six months for Mr. Jhingran and his eligible dependents. 

Upon approval by the Alphabet Board of Directors (or its designee), Mr. Jhingran will be granted 1,700 GSUs as a new hire grant
(the “Jhingran GSUs”).  Twenty-five percent of the Jhingran GSUs will vest on the 25th day of the month following the month in which
the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date occurs, and 1/48th of the Jhingran GSUs will vest monthly thereafter on the 25th of the
month until fully vested, subject to continued employment on the applicable vesting dates. 

For purposes of the Jhingran Google offer letter, “cause” will have substantially the same meaning as such term is used in the
Company offer letter, except that references to the Company therein will refer to Google. 

For purposes of the Jhingran Google offer letter, “good reason” will have the same meaning as such term is used in the Kapoor
Google offer letter. 

Under the Jhingran Google offer letter, Mr. Jhingran agrees that the Merger and the related changes to his compensation, benefits,
duties, responsibilities or reporting obligations set forth in his Jhingran Google offer letter will not by itself constitute good reason
under his Company offer letter or any other plan or agreement entered into with the Company or its affiliates which contain such term

Google Offer Letter with Shankar Ramaswamy

On September 7, 2016, Mr. Ramaswamy and Google entered into an offer letter (the “Ramaswamy Google offer letter”) that,
effective as of the Closing Date, will supersede and replace Mr. Ramaswamy’s Company offer letter.  The Ramaswamy Google offer
letter provides that upon and subject to the closing of the Merger, Mr. Ramaswamy will be employed as Director, Software Engineering
with an annual salary of $324,000 and an annual bonus target of 40% of his annual salary.  The remaining material terms of the
Ramaswamy Google offer letter are identical to the Jhingran Google offer letter (including as to the amounts and terms of the retention
and sign-on bonuses, severance and provisions regarding unvested option consideration and restricted stock units that were assumed
and converted into GSUs). 

Other Executives

Except as described above, as of the date of this proxy statement, none of the Company’s other executive officers have reached an
understanding on potential employment with Google or other retention terms with the Surviving Corporation or with Google, and
except as described above, no Company executive officers have entered into any definitive agreements or arrangements regarding
employment with Google or other retention with the Surviving Corporation or with Google following the consummation of the
Merger.  However, prior to the Effective Time, Google may initiate discussions regarding employment or other retention terms and
may enter into definitive agreements regarding employment or retention for certain of the Company’s executive officers and other
employees, to be effective as of the Effective Time.

Golden Parachute Compensation

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or that otherwise
relates to the Merger that will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers in connection with the Merger.  Please
see the previous portions of this section for further information regarding this compensation.  Apigee qualifies as an “emerging growth
company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, and the disclosure included in the proxy
statement is intended to comply with the disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies.

The Company’s “named executive officers” for purposes of the disclosure in this proxy statement are Messrs. Kapoor, Wan and
Ramaswamy.  The figures in the table below are estimated based on (1) compensation and benefit levels as of October 7, 2016; (2) an
assumed effective date of October 7, 2016 for the Merger (except as noted below); and (3) the assumed termination of the named
executive officer’s employment without cause on the assumed effective date.  The amounts reported below are estimates based on
multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date.  Accordingly, the ultimate values to be
received by a named executive officer in connection with the Merger may differ from the amounts set below. 

Some of the amounts set forth in the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the Merger (“single-trigger”)
and others would be payable upon a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the Merger (“double-trigger”).  As
required by applicable SEC rules, all amounts below that are determined using the per share value of Apigee’s common stock have
been calculated based on the Merger Consideration of $17.40 per share.  Apigee’s named executive officers will not receive pension,
non-qualified deferred compensation enhancements, or tax reimbursement benefits in connection with the Merger.

(1) As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive

Officers in the Merger—Payments to Executives Upon Termination Following Change of Control,” these amounts represent the
“double-trigger” cash severance payments to which each named executive officer may become entitled under his Company offer
letter.  The cash severance payments, payable in a lump-sum on the 60th day following termination of employment, equal 12
months (in the case of Mr. Kapoor) or nine months (in the case of Messrs. Wan and Ramaswamy) of the named executive officer’s
base salary at the rate in effect on the date of termination (the “Company cash severance benefits”), less applicable withholdings. 
The Company cash severance benefits will be payable to Messrs. Kapoor, Wan and Ramaswamy upon the termination of the
individual’s employment by Apigee or its successor without cause (excluding by reasons of death or disability) or by the
individual for good reason, in either case, within the “change in control period” beginning one month preceding, and ending 12
months following a change in control (including the Merger) (in either case, a “NEO qualifying termination”).  The Company
cash severance benefits also will be payable to Messrs. Kapoor, Wan and Ramaswamy upon the termination of the individual’s
employment by Apigee or its successor without cause (excluding by reasons of death or disability) or by the individual for good
reason, in either case, outside of the change in control period.  The receipt of the Company cash severance benefits is conditioned
on the individual executing a general release and waiver of claims against Apigee (or its successor). 

As described above and following the completion of the Merger, each of Messrs. Kapoor and Ramaswamy agreed in his Google
offer letter that the terms of such Google offer letter will supersede his Company offer letter as of the Closing Date, including
with respect to any severance payments or benefits he may otherwise

Executive Officers in the Merger—Employment Arrangements Following the Merger” for additional information. 

 

(2) As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Payments to Executives Upon Termination Following Change in Control,” under the applicable
Company offer letter, 100% of the named executive officer’s outstanding equity awards will vest upon a NEO qualifying
termination.  The value of the acceleration of the company options is calculated by multiplying the number of accelerated
company options with an exercise price less than the Merger Consideration of $17.40 by the difference between $17.40 and the
exercise price.  The value of the restricted stock units is based on the number of outstanding restricted stock units, multiplied by
$17.40.  The following table quantifies the value of equity awards that accelerate upon a NEO qualifying termination.  All such
amounts are “double-trigger” and are conditioned on the individual executing a general release and waiver of claims against
Apigee (or its successor).

Shankar Ramaswamy   $ 1,134,683    $1,957,500  

As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Employment Arrangements Following the Merger,” each of Messrs. Kapoor and Ramaswamy agreed in
his Google offer letter that the terms of such Google offer letter will supersede his Company offer letter as of the Closing Date,
including with respect to the accelerated vesting of company options and restricted stock units he may otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to his Company offer letter.  Pursuant to terms of the Kapoor Google offer letter and the Ramaswamy Google
offer letter, however, if Mr. Kapoor’s or Mr. Ramaswamy’s employment with Google is terminated within the first 12 months
after the Closing Date (1) without cause or (2) for good reason, any unvested option consideration and any restricted stock units
that were assumed and converted into GSUs will fully vest and become payable (a “double-trigger benefit”). 

 

(3) As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Payments to Executives Upon Termination Following Change in Control,” these amounts equal the value
of reimbursement for COBRA premiums for 12 months (in the case of Mr. Kapoor) or nine months (in the case of Messrs. Wan
and Ramaswamy) for the named executive officer and eligible dependents (the “COBRA benefits”).  The COBRA benefits
represent the “double-trigger” COBRA benefit provided under the Company offer letters and will be payable to Messrs. Kapoor,
Wan and Ramaswamy upon a NEO qualifying termination.  The COBRA benefits also will be payable to Messrs. Kapoor, Wan
and Ramaswamy upon the termination of the individual’s employment by the Company or its successor without cause (excluding
by reasons of death or disability) or by the individual for good reason, in either case, outside of the change in control period.  In
the event that providing the COBRA benefits would result in an excise tax to the Company, Mr. Kapoor will instead receive a
payment of $30,000 and Messrs. Wan and Ramaswamy will receive a payment of $22,500, each payable in a lump-sum on the
60th day following termination of employment.  For purposes of this disclosure, we have assumed that the individual will receive
the COBRA benefits and not the cash payment.  The receipt of the COBRA benefits (or the alternate cash payment) is conditioned
on the individual executing a general release and waiver of claims against the Company (or its successor). 

As described above and following the completion of the Merger, each of Messrs. Kapoor and Ramaswamy agreed in his
respective Google offer letter that the terms of such Google offer letter will supersede his Company offer letter as of the Closing
Date, including with respect to any COBRA benefits he may otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to his Company offer
letter.  Please see “The Merger—Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Employment

(4) As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon Change in Control,” the amounts reported in this column represent the lump-sum
transaction bonus each named executive officer will receive upon the closing of the Merger (a “single-trigger benefit”), subject to
the individual’s continued employment with the Company through the closing of the Merger. 

 

(5) The amounts reported are subject to reduction in the event the named executive officer would be better off on an after-tax basis
being cutback than paying the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.  This table assumes no such reductions are required. 

As described above and following the completion of the Merger, each of Messrs. Kapoor and Ramaswamy agreed in his
respective Google offer letter that the terms of such Google offer letter will supersede his Company offer letter as of the Closing
Date.  Please see “The Merger—Interests of Apigee’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Employment
Arrangements Following the Merger” for additional information. 

Closing and Effective Time

Unless otherwise mutually agreed by Google and Apigee, the closing of the Merger will take place no later than the third business
day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to closing of the Merger (described below under the caption “The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger”) (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived, if
permitted, at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver, to the extent permitted, of such conditions at closing). 

The Effective Time will occur upon the filing and acceptance of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (or at such later time as we and Parent may agree and specify in the certificate of merger). 

Appraisal Rights

If the Merger is consummated, Apigee stockholders who do not vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement, who properly demand an appraisal of their shares of common stock, who continuously hold such shares of common stock
through the Effective Time of the Merger and who otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL (including with
respect to certain aggregate ownership requirements) will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under
Section 262 of the DGCL (“Section 262”).  Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262 and in this summary to
a “stockholder” are to a record holder of Apigee common stock. 

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in
its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated into this proxy
statement by reference.  The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a
recommendation that Apigee stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.  Only a holder of record of shares of
common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares of common stock registered in that holder’s name.  A person having
a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee,
must act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an appraisal of such holder’s shares.  If you hold your shares of common stock
through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the
other nominee to ensure that appraisal rights are exercised. 

Under Section 262, holders of record of shares of common stock who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares of common stock to Apigee prior to the vote on the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) do not
vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement; (3) continuously are the record holders of such shares of common
stock through the Effective Time; and (4) otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their
shares of common

stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of common stock,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be
paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.  However, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Apigee stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of
shares of common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of common
stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262; or (b) the value of the Merger Consideration in respect of the
shares of common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million (conditions (a) and (b) referred
to as the “ownership thresholds”).  Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause
shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is
paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period.
However, at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceedings, the Surviving Corporation
may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case such interest will accrue after the time of such
payment only on an amount that equals the difference, if any, between the amount paid and the “fair value” determined by the Court of
Chancery, in addition to the interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment.  The Surviving Corporation is under no
obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. 

Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not
less than twenty (20) days prior to the stockholder meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the Record Date for
notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262.  This proxy statement
constitutes Apigee’s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of
Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C.  In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who
wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex C carefully.  Failure to
strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the
DGCL.  A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration without interest. 
Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of common stock, Apigee
believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel. 

Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the following:
 

 •  the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement;
 

 
•  the stockholder must deliver to Apigee a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement at the

Special Meeting;
 

 
•  the stockholder must continuously hold the shares of common stock from the date of making the demand through the

Effective Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares of common stock before the
Effective Time); and

 

 

•  a stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person) or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery
demanding a determination of the value of the shares of common stock of all stockholders entitled to appraisal within one
hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time.  The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any
petition and has no intention of doing so. 

In addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met. 

Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of
the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise

appraisal rights must vote against the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares of
common stock. 

Filing Written Demand

A stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Apigee, before the vote on the approval and adoption of the
Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement will be submitted to the
stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares of common stock, and that stockholder must not vote or
submit a proxy in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement.  A stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of
record the shares of common stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of
common stock of record through the Effective Time.  A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless
revoked, be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s
right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy
and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the approval and adoption of
the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement.  Neither voting against the approval and
adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262.  The written
demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement. A proxy or vote against the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand.  A stockholder’s
failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special
Meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights. 

Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s
name.  A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and
must reasonably inform Apigee of the identity of the holder and state that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of
such stockholder’s shares of common stock.  If the shares of common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a
trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if such shares of common stock
are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or on
behalf of all joint owners.  An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for
appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in
executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. 

STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR
OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK,
BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK,
BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.  A
PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF
ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE
RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT
APPRAISAL RIGHTS. 

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Apigee Corporation

Any holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered
pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to Apigee a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.  However, any such
attempt to withdraw the demand made more than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the Surviving
Corporation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the
approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the Merger
Consideration within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation. 

Notice by the Surviving Corporation

If the Merger is completed, within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each record holder
of shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of
the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof. 

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of
shares of common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 (or the beneficial
owner of such shares of common stock) may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination
of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal.  The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has
no present intention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any
negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of common stock.  Accordingly, any holders of shares of common stock who
desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of
common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262.  The failure to file such a petition within the period
specified in Section 262 could nullify a previous written demand for appraisal. 

Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied
with the requirements for an appraisal of such holder’s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive
from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of common stock not voted in favor of the
approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which Apigee has received demands for appraisal, and the
aggregate number of holders of such shares of common stock.  The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting
stockholder within ten (10) days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten (10) days after the expiration of
the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.  A beneficial owner of shares of common stock held either in a
voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from
the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements.  As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a
stockholder of record. 

If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after such service to file with the Delaware
Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded appraisal of their
shares of common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached.  After notice to the
stockholders as required by the court, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the stockholders
who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder.  The Delaware

Table of Contents

Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares of common stock to submit their stock
certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any
stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. 

The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Apigee stockholders who assert appraisal rights
unless (1) the total number of shares of common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of
Apigee’s outstanding shares of common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 or (2) the value of the
Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1
million. 

Determination of Fair Value

After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the holders of shares of common stock entitled to appraisal, and that at least
one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the Company stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal
proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing
appraisal proceedings.  Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of
common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest,
if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.  In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take
into account all relevant factors.  Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the
Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal
Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the
date of payment of the judgment.  However, the Surviving Corporation has the right, at any point prior to the Delaware Court of
Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal.  If the
Surviving Corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only
on the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the
fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment. 
In Weinberger v UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in
an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the
financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of
all relevant factors involving the value of a company.”  The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair
value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts
that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262
provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.”  In
Cede & Co. v Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not
encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation.  In Weinberger v UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value,
including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of
speculation, may be considered.”

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did
not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of
the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the
DGCL.  Although Apigee believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of
fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that

such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration.  Neither
Apigee nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of
Apigee and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any
appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of common stock is less than the Merger
Consideration.  If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect
of the Company stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an appraisal will cease.  The costs of the appraisal proceedings
(which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and
charged to the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances.  Upon application of a stockholder,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the
appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata
against the value of all the shares of common stock entitled to an appraisal. 

If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or
validly withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of common stock will be deemed to have been converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in the Merger Agreement.  A stockholder will fail to
perfect, or effectively lose, such holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery
within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Effective Time, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in
respect of the Company stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written
withdrawal of such holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration as provided in the Merger Agreement
in accordance with Section 262. 

From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of
common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other
distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the Effective Time): provided, however, that if no petition for
an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, or if such stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written
withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger Consideration as provided in the Merger
Agreement, either within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation,
then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware
Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the court, and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal
and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within sixty (60) days after the Effective Time. 

Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory
appraisal rights.  Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before
attempting to exercise those rights. 

Accounting Treatment

The Merger will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations under U.S. GAAP. 

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to

discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the
Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), and other applicable authorities, all as in effect
on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. 
This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of
the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). 

This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in
light of their particular circumstances.  For example, this discussion does not address:
 

 

•  tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax
laws, such as financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S-corporations, partnerships or any other entities or
arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and stockholders,
partners or investors in such entities; insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in stocks and securities; traders in
securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities; regulated investment companies;
real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; holders who hold their common stock as
“qualified small business stock” for purposes of Sections 1045 or 1202 of the Code; or certain former citizens or long-term
residents of the United States;

 

 
•  tax consequences to holders holding their shares of common stock as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion,

straddle or other risk reduction transaction;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders that received their shares of common stock in a compensatory transaction or pursuant to the

exercise of options or warrants;
 

 •  tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
 

 

•  tax consequences to holders who hold their shares of common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a
branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States; tax consequences to holders who are “controlled
foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies” or “personal holding companies” for U.S. federal income tax
purposes;

 

 •  tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income;
 

 •  the U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any;
 

 •  any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences; or
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the Merger and who properly demand appraisal of their shares of

common stock under Section 262 of the DGCL. 

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend
upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.  Partnerships holding shares of common stock and
partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger. 

No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger described
below.  If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would ultimately prevail in a final
determination by a court. 

THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL
ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER.  A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT HIS, HER OR ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF HIS, HER OR ITS
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX
LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.

Table of Contents

U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S. federal income
tax purposes:
 

 •  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 

 
•  a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any

state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 •  an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 

 
•  a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United

States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid election in effect under applicable
Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. 

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger.  A
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of common stock.  Such gain
or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares of
common stock is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger.  A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will
apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals).  The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations. 

Non-U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is neither a
U.S. holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
 

 

•  the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by
an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the
United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to
U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of
30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);

 

 
•  such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that

disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty); or

 

 

•  Apigee is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the
Code (“USRPHC”) at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s
holding period with respect to the applicable shares of common stock (the “relevant period”), and, if shares of common
stock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such
Non-U.S. Holder owns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than 5% of our common stock at any
time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally
applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the branch profits tax will not apply.  We
believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the Merger.

Table of Contents

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 28%) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant
to the Merger.  Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number
and certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form) or (2) a Non-
U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification of such holder’s foreign status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute
or successor form) or (b) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding.  Backup withholding is not an additional tax. 
Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. 

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters

Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be completed until Parent and Apigee file a
notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
(the “DOJ”) under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated.  The termination or expiration of the
waiting period means the parties have satisfied the regulatory requirements under the HSR Act.  Parent and Apigee made the necessary
filings with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ on September 20, 2016.  The applicable waiting period is scheduled to
expire at 11:59 pm on October 20, 2016, unless terminated or extended. 

At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary under the applicable statutes, including
seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to
license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights.  At any time before or after the completion of
the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state attorney general could take such
action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary.  Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or
seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing
relationships and contractual rights.  Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances. 

Austria

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the Merger is notified to the Federal
Competition Authority (Bundeswettbewerbsbehörde, the “FCA”) and the Federal Cartel Prosecutor (Bundeskartellanwalt, the “FCP”)
and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated.  Parent made the necessary notification on September 23, 2016.  The
applicable waiting period will expire on October 21, 2016, unless terminated or extended.  If neither the FCA nor the FCP apply to the
Cartel Court (Kartellgericht) for an in-depth investigation within the waiting period, the Merger is deemed legally cleared.  Parent and
Apigee will receive a declaration confirming whether or not an in-depth investigation has been opened one or two business days after
expiration of the waiting period.

Germany

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until the Merger is notified to the German Federal
Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt, the “FCO”) and the FCO has either cleared the Merger or the applicable decision deadline has
expired.  Parent made the necessary notification to the FCO on September 22, 2016.  The applicable decision deadline will expire on
October 24, 2016, unless the deadline is extended or it is found that the notification is incomplete; in the latter case, a new one month
deadline will come into effect from the day that a complete notification is filed with the FCO.

Table of Contents

Other Regulatory Approvals

Other than the filings described above, we are not aware of any mandatory regulatory filings to be made, approvals to be obtained
or waiting periods to expire, in order to consummate the Merger. 

One or more governmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants
the necessary approvals and consents.  Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or
overturn regulatory approvals, any of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory
approvals.  There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such
approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial period of time between the approval by stockholders and the
completion of the Merger. 

Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these
regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and
approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest
assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement.  These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the
Merger not being satisfied. 

Commitments to Obtain Approvals

Parent and Apigee have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory notification requirements and
obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
(including (1) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”); and (2) the approval or clearance of the Merger by the relevant antitrust authorities in Austria
and Germany), subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement and discussed below. 

Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, Google shall not be required to agree (and Apigee shall
neither agree nor permit any of its subsidiaries to agree without the prior written consent of Google (and Apigee shall, if Google so
directs, agree, so long as such agreement is conditioned upon closing)) to (1) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any of
the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of Google and
merger sub (and their respective affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and Apigee and its subsidiaries, on the other hand, (2) the
imposition of any limitation on the ability of Google, the surviving corporation, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to
conduct their respective businesses or own any capital stock or assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of their
respective businesses and, in the case of Google, the businesses of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries, (3) payment of any
consideration, relinquishment of any right or agreement to any modifications of existing contracts or entry into new contracts (other
than the payment of customary filing and application fees) in connection with obtaining any waivers, consents, approvals from
governmental authorities under the antitrust laws of any relevant antitrust jurisdiction, or (4) the imposition of any impediment on
Google, the surviving corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates under any antitrust laws of any relevant antitrust
jurisdiction; provided, that Google shall agree to the divestiture of assets of Apigee or any of its subsidiaries that are immaterial to
Apigee and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
solely to the extent necessary both to (A) obtain clearances under the antitrust laws, or to remove any court or regulatory orders under
the antitrust laws, that in each case are impeding the ability to consummate the Merger by the termination date (as the same may be
extended) and (B) permit the closing to occur by the termination date (as the same may be extended), provided, that any such
divestiture would be conditioned upon the closing. Nothing in the Merger Agreement will require Google (or permit Apigee without
the prior written consent of Google) to litigate with any governmental authority.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement.  The Merger Agreement and the summary of
terms below have been included in this proxy statement to provide you with information regarding the terms of the Merger and are not
intended to provide any factual information about Apigee, Google, Merger Sub, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. 
Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement or in the public filings that Apigee makes with the SEC, as described
in under the caption “Where You Can Find More Information,” beginning on page 118 of this proxy statement.  The descriptions of the
Merger Agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by
reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy
statement by reference.  We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not
contain all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you.  The rights and obligations of the parties are
governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this
proxy statement.  Capitalized terms used in this section but not defined in this proxy statement have the meaning ascribed to
them in the Merger Agreement. 

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (1) were made
only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger
Agreement; and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Apigee, Google
and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement.  The representations and warranties may also be
subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC
and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Google and Merger Sub by Apigee in connection with the Merger
Agreement.  In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of
allocating contractual risk between Apigee, Google and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to
standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors.  None of the representations or
warranties will survive the closing of the Merger and they will therefore have no legal effect under the Merger Agreement after the
closing of the Merger.  The parties will only be able to assert the inaccuracy of the representations and warranties as a basis for refusing
to close the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement as described below under the caption “—Conditions to the Closing
of the Merger.” Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Apigee,
Google or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses.  Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be
fully reflected in Apigee’s or Google’s public disclosure.  Furthermore, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement
as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Apigee, Google and Merger Sub because the parties may take certain actions that
are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the
appropriate party, which consent may be given without notice to the public.  The Merger Agreement is described below, and included
as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information
regarding Apigee, Google, Merger Sub or their respective businesses.  Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and
other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this
document and in our reports, statements and filings with the SEC regarding Apigee and our business.  For more information, see the
section captioned “Where You Can Find More Information,” beginning on page 118 of this proxy statement.

Merger Consideration

Common Stock

At the Effective Time, each share of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including shares of
common stock resulting from the deemed exercise of the warrant pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, but
other than excluded shares), will be canceled, extinguished and automatically converted into the right to $17.40 per share in cash,
without interest and less any applicable taxes.  From and after the Effective Time, all shares of common stock of Apigee shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of shares of common stock of Apigee
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the cash consideration issuable in respect thereof pursuant
to the previous sentence. 

Outstanding Stock Awards of the Company

The Merger Agreement provides that Apigee’s stock awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
subject to the following treatment at the Effective Time:

Treatment of Company Options

At the Effective Time, each company option (whether vested or unvested) with a per share exercise price that equals or exceeds
$17.40 will be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration. 

At the Effective Time, and except as provided above, each vested company option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the vested option consideration.  As soon as practicable (and in no event
more than 30 calendar days) following the Closing Date, Google will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder of a vested
company option the vested option consideration (if any), less applicable taxes. 

At the Effective Time, and except as provided above, each unvested company option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be assumed and converted into the right to receive the unvested option consideration, with payment of the unvested
option consideration, less applicable taxes, to be made in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such unvested company
option immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that such holder remains employed by or otherwise in service to Google, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective subsidiaries on each applicable vesting date, subject to the terms and conditions of the
unvested payment plan. 

Treatment of Restricted Stock Units

At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit held by an individual who is an active employee of the Company or its
subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed and
converted into GSUs in respect of that number of shares of Alphabet Class C Capital Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Company common stock underlying such restricted stock units multiplied by (2) the
stock award exchange ratio.  Each such GSU will continue to have, and will continue to be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to the restricted stock unit prior to the Effective Time (but, taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the
company equity incentive plans or in the underlying award agreement by reason of the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby).

Table of Contents

At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit held by an individual who is a former employee of the Company or its
subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than a non-employee member of the Board of Directors or any consultant or
independent contractor to Apigee or its subsidiaries) which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive the restricted stock unit consideration.  As soon as practicable (and in no event more than 30
calendar days following the closing), Google shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder of restricted stock units the
restricted stock unit consideration, less any applicable taxes. 

At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit held by (1) a person other than an individual described in the foregoing two
paragraphs or (2) any non-employee member of the Board of Directors or any consultant or independent contractor to Apigee or its
subsidiaries which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest and be settled in Apigee common stock and each
such share shall be canceled in exchange for the Merger Consideration. 

Company Equity Incentive Plans

Unless otherwise determined by Alphabet in its sole discretion prior to the Closing Date, Google will cause Alphabet to assume
the company equity incentive plans effective as of the Effective Time and subject to adjustment based on the stock award exchange
ratio.

ESPP

The purchase period in effect as of September 7, 2016 will be the final purchase period under the ESPP.  All outstanding purchase
rights under the ESPP will automatically be exercised upon the earlier of (1) a date prior to the Effective Time (but not later than 10
business days before the Effective Time) and (2) the purchase date of the current purchase period in progress, and the ESPP will
terminate as of the Effective Time.  No new purchase periods will begin under the ESPP on or after September 7, 2016, and ESPP
participants will not be permitted to increase the rate of payroll contributions or make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP
after September 7, 2016.  All shares of common stock purchased under the ESPP and held by an individual as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

Warrant

Any warrant that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, with an applicable exercise price per share that is
less than the Merger Consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of Google, Merger
Sub, Apigee or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into, and shall become a right to receive, such number of shares as
calculated in accordance with its terms and such shares (if any) issued or issuable as a result of such deemed exercise of the warrant
shall be deemed to be shares of Apigee common stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time which
shares at the Effective Time will be canceled, extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, any warrant with an applicable exercise price per
share that is equal to or exceeds the Merger Consideration shall be immediately cancelled at the Effective Time without any cash
payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.  The cancellation or substitution, as applicable, of a warrant as provided
in the Merger Agreement shall be deemed the termination, and satisfaction in full of, any and all rights the holder had or may have had
in respect of such warrant. 

Exchange and Payment Procedures

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Apigee as the “payment agent,” to
make payments of the Merger Consideration to stockholders.

Table of Contents

On or the business day following the Closing Date, Google or the Surviving Corporation will deposit (or cause to be deposited)
with the payment agent, for payment to holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, an amount of cash equal
to the product of the Merger Consideration multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than excluded shares). 

Promptly following the Effective Time, Google and the Surviving Corporation will cause the payment agent to mail to each
holder of record of shares of common stock, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose shares of common stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, (1) a letter of transmittal
in customary form which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of a
certificate or certificates (the “Certificates”) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of common
stock of Apigee (other than excluded shares) (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof if such Certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Google or the payment agent in their respective discretion, a bond) or transfer of non-certificated shares
of common stock of Apigee represented by book-entry (other than excluded shares) to the payment agent (as evidenced by receipt by
the payment agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form or such other evidence as the payment agent may reasonably request)
and (2) instructions advising stockholders how to surrender the certificates or transfer the uncertificated shares of common stock in
exchange for their portion of the Merger Consideration. 

Each holder of shares of common stock of Apigee that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of common stock represented by a Certificate or such
uncertificated shares of common stock represented by book-entry (1) in the case of shares of common stock represented by a
Certificate, upon surrender to the payment agent of such Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the payment agent or (2) in the case of a book-entry transfer
of uncertificated shares of common stock promptly following the closing.  Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, from
and after the Effective Time each such Certificate or uncertificated shares of common stock represented by book-entry shall represent
for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of the Merger
Agreement.  The amount of any Merger Consideration paid to the stockholders may be reduced by any applicable taxes.  No interest
will be paid or accrued on any cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate or uncertificated share of common stock. 

If any cash deposited with the payment agent is not claimed within six (6) months following the Effective Time, such cash will be
returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of common stock who have not complied with the exchange
procedures in the Merger Agreement will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
similar laws) as general creditors for any payment of and claim to the applicable Merger Consideration, without interest.  Any net
profit resulting from, or interest produced by, such deposits with the payment agent shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation. 

Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the payment agent to pay for shares of common stock for which
appraisal rights have been perfected will be delivered to Parent promptly (and in any event within two (2) business days) of Parent’s
demand to the payment agent therefore; provided that in such case, until six (6) months after the Effective Time, Parent will make
available to the payment agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of such shares of common stock to any
holder thereof that withdraws or otherwise loses appraisal rights as set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a Certificate or if such Certificate has been stolen or
destroyed.  In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the payment agent (or if subsequent to the
termination of the payment fund, Google) shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the payment agent or Google, as the case may be) of that fact by the holder
thereof, the Merger Consideration issuable in respect thereof pursuant to the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that the

Table of Contents

Surviving Corporation, Google or the payment agent may, in their respective discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation, Google or the payment agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

Representations and Warranties

The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of Apigee, Google and Merger Sub. 

Some of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by Apigee are qualified as to “materiality” or
“Company Material Adverse Effect.” For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Company Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect
to Apigee, any fact, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance, change or effect that, individually or when taken together with all other
such facts, events, violations, inaccuracies, circumstances, changes or effects that exist or have occurred prior to or at the date of
determination of the occurrence of the Company Material Adverse Effect, has had or would reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to (1) the business, operations, financial condition or results of operations of Apigee and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or
(2) the ability of Apigee to consummate the Merger prior to the termination date (as the same may be extended) and to fully perform its
covenants and other obligations under the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall such facts, events, violations,
inaccuracies, circumstances, changes or effects, directly or indirectly, resulting from any of the following, either alone or in
combination, be taken into account when determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may, would or
could occur:
 

 •  general economic or political conditions in the United States or any other country or region in the world;

•  the public announcement or pendency of the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement provided that this clause will not apply to any representation or warranty (or any condition to the

warranty is to address the consequences resulting from the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger;

 

 

•  any failure by Apigee to meet published analysts’ estimates, projections or forecasts of revenues, earnings or other financial
or business metrics, in and of itself, or any failure by Apigee to meet any internal budgets, plans or forecasts of its revenues,
earnings or other financial performance or results of operations (it being understood that the underlying cause(s) of any such
failure may be taken into consideration unless otherwise prohibited by the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect);

 

 
•  any decline in the market price or change in the trading volume of Apigee’s common stock, in and of itself (it being

understood that the underlying cause(s) of any such failure may be taken into consideration unless otherwise prohibited by
the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect);

 

 
•  any action taken pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (other than the Company operating in the ordinary course of

business in compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement);
 

 
•  any action taken at the express written request of Google or with the prior written consent or approval of Google following

the date of the Merger Agreement; and

to the extent that such event, circumstance, change or effect does not have a materially disproportionate adverse impact on Apigee or
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared to other companies that operate in the industries in which Apigee and its subsidiaries
operate in which case only the incremental disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into account in determining whether there

At all times commencing on the date of the Merger Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of the

likely to lead to a superior proposal (as defined below); provided that (a) the Board of Directors (i) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such acquisition proposal either constitutes or is reasonably likely
to lead to a superior proposal and (ii) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and at the time of taking such action, such acquisition
proposal constitutes or continues be reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal, (b) Apigee enters into, an acceptable
confidentiality agreement with such third party, (c) Apigee notifies Google of the identity of such person and provides Google all of the
material terms and conditions of such acquisition proposal and if such acquisition proposal is in written form, Apigee provides Google

party (and/or any of its representatives), Apigee furnishes or makes available such non-public information to Google or its
representatives (to the extent such information has not been previously furnished to Google). 

For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement:

“acquisition proposal” means any offer, proposal or indication of interest from any third party (other than an offer or proposal by
Google or Merger Sub) relating to any acquisition transaction. 

“acquisition transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement) involving:

(1) any acquisition or purchase by any third party, directly or indirectly, of more than twenty percent (20%) of any class of
outstanding voting or equity securities of Apigee (or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, such voting or equity
securities of Apigee), or any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any
third party (or the stockholders of any such third party) beneficially owning more than twenty percent (20%) of any class of
outstanding voting or equity securities of Apigee;

(2) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, joint venture, recapitalization, reorganization, extraordinary
dividend, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving Apigee and a third party pursuant to which the stockholders of
Apigee immediately preceding such transaction hold less than eighty percent (80%) of the voting power in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction or the resulting direct or indirect parent of Apigee or such surviving or resulting entity (or any securities
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities representing such voting power); or

(3) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer or other disposition to a third party of more
than twenty percent (20%) of the consolidated assets of Apigee and its subsidiaries whether measured by fair market value, revenue
generation or net income and including equity investments in subsidiaries). 

“superior proposal” means any bona fide written acquisition proposal made by a third party after September 7, 2016 that (1) did
not result from a breach (or deemed breach) of the Merger Agreement, (2) would result in such third party (or in the case of a direct
merger between such third party and Apigee, the stockholders of such third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of
the outstanding shares of common stock or all or substantially all of the assets of Apigee and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and
(3) is on terms that the Board of Directors determines (after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) that, if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, taking into account (a) any modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement proposed by Google and (b) the likelihood and timing of the consummation of such acquisition proposal and the other
terms and conditions of such acquisition proposal, including the financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects. 

“competing acquisition transaction” has the same meaning as “acquisition transaction” except that all references therein to “20%”
and “80%” will be deemed to be references to “50%”.

The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the recommendation that the
holders of shares of common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement (the “company board
recommendation”).  The Merger Agreement provides that neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof will:
 

 
•  fail to make, withdraw, amend or modify the company board recommendation in a manner that is materially adverse to

Google, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify the company board recommendation in a manner that
is materially adverse to Google;

 

 
•  approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, an acquisition

proposal or acquisition transaction other than the Merger;
 

 •  enter into an acquisition agreement; or
 

 
•  refrain from recommending against (and reaffirming the company board recommendation) any acquisition proposal or

acquisition transaction that is a tender offer or exchange offer within 10 business days after the commencement thereof (the
actions or inactions referred to above being referred to herein as a “company board recommendation change”). 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may (1) effect a company board recommendation change in response to an
acquisition transaction that the Board of Directors has determined is a superior proposal or (2) authorize Apigee to terminate the
Merger Agreement to enter into an acquisition agreement with respect to such superior proposal, subject, in the case of the preceding
clause (2), to the prior or concurrent payment of the company termination fee (as defined below), if:
 

 
•  the Board of Directors has received a bona fide, unsolicited written acquisition proposal, after the date of the Merger

Agreement that did not result from a breach, or deemed breach, of Apigee’s non-solicitation obligations under the Merger
Agreement;

 

 

•  the Board of Directors (1) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal
counsel) that such acquisition proposal is a superior proposal and (2) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law
(which determinations and any public announcement thereof will not constitute a company board recommendation change
unless and until such party have failed at or prior to one business day following the end of either the four (4) business day
period or additional three (3) business day notice period described below, as applicable, (and upon the occurrence of such
failure, such determination and such public announcement shall constitute a company board recommendation change) to
publicly announce that it (a) was recommending that the stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated thereby and (b) has determined that such acquisition proposal is not a superior proposal and has
publicly rejected such acquisition proposal (taking into account in (i) any modifications or adjustments made to the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby and agreed to by the parties hereto and in (ii) any modifications or
adjustments made to such acquisition proposal));

 

 

•  prior to effecting such company board recommendation change or termination of the Merger Agreement, the Board of
Directors will have given Google at least four (4) business days’ notice of its intention to effect such action as described
herein (which notice will include the most current version of the proposed definitive agreement and, to the extent not
included therein, all material terms and conditions of such superior proposal and the identity of the person making such
superior proposal);

 

 
•  if requested by Google, during the four (4) business day notice period described above, Apigee has met and negotiated in

good faith with Google regarding modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that such superior
proposal would cease to be a superior proposal;

 

 
•  prior to the end of such four (4) business day period, Google has not made a counter-offer or proposal in writing and in a

manner that, if accepted by Apigee, would form a binding contract, that the Board of

Directors determines (after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) is at least as favorable to the
stockholders of Apigee as the superior proposal (it being understood that (1) any material revision to the terms of the
superior proposal, including any revision in price, will require a new notice period, except such notice period will be three
(3) business days, (2) the notice period will be extended, if applicable, to the extent necessary to ensure that at least three
(3) business days remain subsequent to each time Apigee notifies Google of any material revision and (3) there may be
multiple extensions of the notice period); and

 

 

•  the Board of Directors determined (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and after considering any counter-offer
or proposal made by Google as described above) that, in light of such superior proposal, the failure to either (1) effect a
company board recommendation change or (2) terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into the acquisition agreement
with respect to such superior proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties. 

At any time prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval, the Board of Directors may effect a company board
recommendation change, other than pursuant to a superior proposal, in response to an intervening event if the Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable law, but only if:
 

 
•  Apigee has provided prior written notice to Google at least four (4) business days in advance of its intention to take such

action, which notice must describe the intervening event in reasonable detail; and
 

 

•  prior to effecting such company board recommendation change, Apigee and its representatives, during such four (4) business
day period, have if requested by Google, negotiated in good faith with Google and its representatives regarding modification
to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that the Board of Directors no longer determines in good faith that
the failure to make a company board recommendation change in response to such intervening event would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law. 

For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement, an “intervening event” means any material event, circumstance,
change, effect, development or condition first occurring or arising after September 7, 2016 that (1) was not known or reasonably
foreseeable by the Board of Directors as of or prior to September 7, 2016 and which first became known or reasonably foreseeable
prior to the receipt of the requisite stockholder approval (or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not
known or reasonably foreseeable by the Board of Directors as of September 7, 2016 and which first became known or reasonably
foreseeable prior to the receipt of the requisite stockholder approval) and (2) does not relate in any manner to an acquisition proposal;
provided, that the following will not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an intervening event has occurred:
(a) any change in the price or trading volume of the shares of common stock (it being understood, however, that any underlying cause
thereof may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether an intervening event has occurred) and (b) any fact, event,
violation, inaccuracy, circumstance, change or effect resulting from any action taken or initiated by Apigee or any of its subsidiaries
pursuant to and in compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. 

Employee Benefits

From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will honor all of the employee benefit plans (including the
Company offer letters) included in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation or
Google, as applicable, from amending or terminating any such employee benefit plans, or other compensation or benefits plans,
arrangements or agreements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by applicable law. 

For a period of one-year following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will provide (1) compensation (other than
equity-based compensation) to each employee of Apigee and its subsidiaries who

continues his or her employment with Apigee, its subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation, Google or any subsidiary of Google as of
and following the Effective Time (“each, a “continuing employee”) that is substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation (other than equity-based compensation) provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(2) health and welfare benefits to each continuing employee that are substantially similar to those health and welfare benefits that are
(a) provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the Effective Time or (b) provided to similarly situated employees of
Google or its subsidiaries, and (3) cash-based severance benefits (other than reimbursement of COBRA continuation costs) to eligible
continuing employees that are no less favorable than those provided under the designated employee benefit plans included in the
confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement. 

The Surviving Corporation will provide each continuing employee with credit for all service with Apigee and its subsidiaries (and
their respective predecessors) prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits
where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement but excluding for
purposes of any defined benefit pension plan).  However, such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in
duplication of coverage or benefits.  Continuing employees will be eligible to participate immediately in benefit plans sponsored by the
Surviving Corporation that replace any comparable benefit plans of Apigee in which the employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time.  With respect to any new medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefit plans, the Surviving
Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work and similar requirements to be waived and for participants to receive full credit for
eligible expenses toward deductibles and similar requirements for the applicable plan year. 

Efforts to Close the Merger

Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of the Merger Agreement, including with respect to matters related to antitrust
laws and clearances and litigation thereunder (as described further in the section captioned “The Merger—Regulatory Approvals
Required for the Merger—Commitment to Obtain Approvals”), each of Google, Merger Sub and Apigee agreed to use their reasonable
best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and to do (or cause to be done), and to assist and cooperate with the other party or
parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper and advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to
(1) cause the closing conditions to the Merger to be satisfied or fulfilled, (2) obtain all necessary consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from governmental authorities, and (3) seek all necessary or appropriate consents, waivers and approvals from third
parties in connection with the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement so as to maintain and preserve the benefits of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger). 

Indemnification and Insurance

The Merger Agreement provides that the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Google will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of Apigee and its subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements, set forth in the confidential company disclosure letter between Apigee or any of its subsidiaries on the one
hand, and any of their respective current or former directors and officers of Apigee or Apigee’s subsidiaries, on the other hand and (so
long as such indemnification agreements are substantially consistent in all material respects with the form of indemnification
agreement made available to Google prior to the date of the Merger Agreement and a true, complete, correct and unredacted copy of
such executed indemnification agreement is promptly provided to Google) any person who becomes a director or officer of Apigee or
its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the “indemnified persons”).  In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Google

Agreement with Apigee in effect on the day of the Merger Agreement, each indemnified person from and against any costs, fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises, directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or
indirectly to (1) any action or omission or alleged action or omission, in such indemnified person’s capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent of Apigee or Apigee’s subsidiaries or other affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged
action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time); or (2) any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.  If, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any indemnified person delivers to Google a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification under the appropriate section of the Merger Agreement, then the claim asserted in such
notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.  In the event
of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (x) Google and the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the
defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation
will be deemed to have agreed to not assert that the indemnified person is not entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to such
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry), (y) Google and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such indemnified person
for any legal expenses of other counsel subsequently incurred by such indemnified person in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Google or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for such indemnified person advises
that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Google or the Surviving Corporation and such indemnified person, such
indemnified person may retain counsel satisfactory to them and reasonably satisfactory to Google, and Google or the Surviving
Corporation will pay all reasonable and documented fees and expenses of such counsel for such indemnified person promptly as
statements therefor are received upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such indemnified person to repay such amount or
any other amount paid on behalf of such indemnified person if it is ultimately determined in accordance with clause (b) of the
following sentence that such indemnified person is not entitled to be indemnified; provided, however, that Google and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this clause (y) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all indemnified persons in any
jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such indemnified persons would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, provided
that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used; (3) the indemnified persons will cooperate in
the defense of any such matter at Google’s or the Surviving Corporation’s expense; and (4) Google and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be liable for any settlement effected without its express written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in the Merger Agreement, (a) neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its affiliates (including
Google) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an indemnified person under the Merger
Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all indemnified persons
from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry or such indemnified persons otherwise consent and
(b) Google and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation under the Merger Agreement to any indemnified person if and
when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and nonappealable,
that the indemnification of such indemnified person in the manner contemplated by the

Merger Agreement is prohibited by applicable law and any and all amounts previously paid on behalf of such indemnified person will
be repaid to Google or the Surviving Corporation by or on behalf of such indemnified person. 

In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Google will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect Apigee’s current directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering
each person covered by the D&O Insurance, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are on substantially similar terms
and conditions to those of the D&O Insurance; provided, however, that in satisfying such obligation pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the amount
paid by Apigee for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such two hundred fifty percent (250%) amount, the “Maximum Annual
Premium”); provided, however, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, the
Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with, in the good faith determination of the Surviving Corporation, the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium.  Prior to the Effective Time, Apigee, following
reasonable consultation with Google, shall have the right to (and if Google requests, Apigee will) purchase a six-year “tail” prepaid
policy on the D&O Insurance; provided, however, that, in no event shall Apigee pay, or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay,
an aggregate premium for such “tail” policy in excess of the Maximum Annual Premium.  In the event that Apigee elects to purchase
such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Google will cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in which case, the
Surviving Corporation (and Google) will have no further obligations under the Merger Agreement for so long as such “tail” policy is
maintained in full force and effect. 

The obligations related to indemnification and insurance under the Merger Agreement may not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any indemnified person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the
D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in the preceding paragraph (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior
written consent of such affected indemnified person or other person who is a beneficiary under the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy
referred to in the preceding paragraph (and their heirs and representatives).  Each of the indemnified persons or other persons who are
beneficiaries under the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in the preceding paragraph (and their heirs and representatives)
are intended to be third party beneficiaries of the agreements related thereto with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.  The
rights of the indemnified persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in
the preceding paragraph (and their heirs and representatives)) will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that
such persons may have under the charter, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements
of or entered into by Apigee or any of its subsidiaries, or applicable law. 

The obligations of Google and the Surviving Corporation or its successors will be subject to any limitation imposed by applicable
law (including any limitation on Apigee’s ability to indemnify its own directors and officers) and Google will have no obligation to
maintain the existence of the Surviving Corporation for any specified period following the Effective Time.

and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Special Meeting of the stockholders of Apigee as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of the Merger Agreement for
the purpose of voting upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement in accordance with Delaware law. 

Apigee will be able to postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting only if (1) there are not holders of a sufficient number of shares of
common stock present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting, (2) Apigee is
required to postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting by applicable law, order or a request from the SEC or its staff, or (3) the Board of
Directors (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is required by
applicable law to postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting, including if the Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is required by applicable law in order to give Apigee’s stockholders sufficient time to
evaluate any information or disclosure that Apigee has sent to its stockholders or otherwise made available to them (including in
connection with any company board recommendation change). 

Apigee has agreed that in no event will the Special Meeting be postponed or adjourned (1) by more than ten (10) calendar days at
a time without the prior written consent of Google; (2) with respect to (1) in the paragraph above, by more than thirty (30) calendar
days after the date on which the Special Meeting was (or was required to be) originally scheduled without the prior written consent of
Google or (3) with respect to (3) in the paragraph above, by more than ten (10) business days, or such other amount of time reasonably
agreed by Apigee and Google to be necessary to comply with applicable law, and, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses
(1) through (3) in no event shall the Special Meeting be postponed or adjourned to a date that is later than six (6) business days prior to
the termination date (as the same may be extended).  Apigee will, at the instruction of Google, postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting
if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement to allow
reasonable time for the solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining the requisite stockholder approval.  Any additional
postponements or adjournments shall be by mutual agreement of Apigee and Google.  In no event will the record date of the Special
Meeting be changed without Google’s prior written consent, unless required by applicable law. 

Without the prior written consent of Google, the adoption of the Merger Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of
procedure and matters required by applicable law to be voted on by the stockholders in connection with the adoption of the Merger
Agreement) that Apigee will propose to be acted on by the stockholders at the Special Meeting. 

Unless the Merger Agreement is terminated, Apigee has agreed that it will establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Special Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement in accordance with Delaware law,
whether or not the Board of Directors at any time subsequent to the date of the Merger Agreement shall have effected a company board
recommendation change or otherwise shall determine that the Merger Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that the
stockholders reject it. 

Transaction Litigation

Prior to the Effective Time, Apigee will promptly notify Google of all legal proceedings commenced or threatened against Apigee
or any of its subsidiaries, directors, officers, representatives or affiliates, in each case in connection with, or arising from or otherwise
relating to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (“transaction litigation”) (including by
providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and thereafter keep Google reasonably informed with respect to the status
thereof.  Apigee will give Google the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any transaction
and consult with Google with respect to the defense, settlement or prosecution of any transaction litigation. 

Treatment of Existing Credit Agreement

Prior to or at closing, Apigee will deliver to Google and Merger Sub an executed payoff letter with respect to its current credit
agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Google.

•  the Merger Agreement is terminated by Apigee at any time prior to receiving the requisite stockholder approval if (1) Apigee
has received a superior proposal and (2) the Board of Directors has authorized the Company to enter into an acquisition
agreement to consummate the acquisition transaction contemplated by that superior proposal so long as Apigee complies
with certain of its obligations related to such superior proposal and immediately prior to or concurrently with, and as a
condition to the effectiveness of, such termination, Apigee will pay or cause to be paid to Google (or its designee) the
company terminate fee;

 

 

•  the Merger Agreement is terminated by Google at any time prior to the approval of the Merger Agreement by the

recommendation within five (5) business days of any reasonable request by Google or any receipt of an acquisition proposal
(and if the Special Meeting is scheduled to be held within five (5) business days, then within one (1) business day of any
such request by Google), with such company termination fee to be paid by Apigee within one (1) business day after the date
of such termination; or

recommendation., with such company termination fee to be paid by Apigee within one (1) business day after the date of

terminate the Merger Agreement, Google shall be entitled to receipt of any company termination fee that would have been (or would
have subsequently become) payable had Google terminated the Merger Agreement at such time. 

The parties have agreed that in no event will Apigee be required to pay the company termination fee on more than one occasion,
whether or not the company termination fee may be payable under more than one provision of the Merger Agreement at the same or at
different times and the occurrence of different events.

nor Merger Sub shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive
damages, against Apigee or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers,
members, shareholders or affiliates or their respective representatives in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby; provided, however, that nothing will relieve any party from liability for any willful and intentional breach of the
Merger Agreement prior to such termination, or any fraud committed in connection with the Merger Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated thereby.

Termination Fee Payable by Google

If the Merger Agreement is terminated in the circumstance specified in the immediately following paragraph, Google has agreed
to pay Apigee a termination fee of $46,600,000 (the “parent termination fee”). 

Google will pay the parent termination fee to Apigee if the Merger Agreement is terminated:
 

 

•  by Apigee or Google because the (1) termination date (as the same may be extended) has passed; or (2) if any governmental
authority of any competent jurisdiction will have enacted, issued, promulgated, entered, enforced or deemed applicable to
the Merger any applicable law that is in effect and has the effect of making the consummation of the Merger permanently
illegal or which has the effect of permanently prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, or issued or granted any order
that has the effect of making the Merger illegal permanently or which has the effect of permanently prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger and such order has become final and nonappealable; if, as of the time of such termination,
(a) the only conditions to closing set forth in the Merger Agreement (discussed above) that have not been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the closing, each of which shall be capable of
being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date the notice of termination is delivered as evidenced by written confirmation
by those persons or entities pursuant to the Merger Agreement are those relating to the absence of any (i) law enacted,
issued, promulgated, entered, enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger or (ii) any order issued or granted (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent), in each case, by a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction that is in effect
and has the effect of making the Merger illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting the consummation of the Merger
(solely with respect to antitrust laws), (b) such failure to be satisfied is due to (i) the failure to receive any required consent
or approval (including the expiration or termination of any waiting period and any extension thereof under the HSR Act)
from a governmental authority pursuant to antitrust laws or (ii) any action (including the enacting, issuing, entry or
promulgation of orders or applicable laws or instituting of proceedings) by any governmental authority to enjoin or
otherwise prohibit the Merger or make it illegal pursuant to antitrust laws, and (c) that none of Apigee, its subsidiaries or
their respective officers, directors or employees has taken any action or failed to take any action (which action or failure to
act constitutes a breach by Apigee of the Merger Agreement) that was a principal cause of the failure of the conditions to
closing referenced above. 

The parties have agreed that in no event will Google be required to pay the parent termination fee on more than one occasion,
whether nor not the parent termination fee may be payable under more than one provision of the Merger Agreement at the same or at
different times and the occurrence of different events. 

In the event that Apigee will receive payment of the parent termination fee as described above, Google and Merger Sub will have
no further liability to Apigee under the Merger Agreement or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby,
Apigee will be precluded from any other remedy against Google and Merger Sub, at law or in equity or otherwise, and Apigee will not
seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against Google
and Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers,
members, shareholders or affiliates or their respective representatives in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby; provided, however, that nothing will relieve any party from liability for any willful and intentional breach of the
Merger Agreement prior to such termination, or any fraud committed in connection with the Merger Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated thereby. 

Specific Performance

The parties have agreed that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of the Merger Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would
not be an adequate remedy for any such damages (except with respect to

the payment of the company termination fee or parent termination fee, if applicable and required under the terms of the Merger
Agreement).  Accordingly, the parties have acknowledged and agreed that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by Apigee,
on the one hand, or Google and Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in the
Merger Agreement, Apigee, on the one hand, and Google and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of the Merger Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under the Merger Agreement, provided, however, that (1) Google and
Merger Sub shall not be entitled to any such injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief if the Merger
Agreement is terminated and Apigee has paid the company termination fee in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and
(2) Apigee shall not be entitled to any such injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief if the Merger
Agreement is terminated and Parent has paid the parent termination fee in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. 

Expenses

Except in specified circumstances, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Merger) will be paid by the party or parties, as applicable, incurring such
expense, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

Amendment

Subject to applicable law and to the other provisions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement may be amended by the
parties at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each Apigee, Google and Merger Sub; provided,
however, that in the event that the Merger Agreement has been approved by the stockholders of the Company in accordance with
Delaware law, no amendment will be made to the Merger Agreement that requires further approval by such stockholders without such
approval. 

Governing Law; Jurisdiction

The Merger Agreement is governed by Delaware law.  The parties have agreed that any actions or proceedings arising in
connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Merger) shall be brought, tried and
determined only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines
to accept or does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any other state or federal court within the State of Delaware), and the
parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court for the purpose of such actions or proceedings. 

No Third-Party Beneficiaries

The parties agreed that (1) their respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in the Merger
Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other party thereto in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement
and (2) the Merger Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other person any rights or remedies thereunder, except
for those discussed above under the caption “—Indemnification and Insurance” and the rights of stockholders to the Merger
Consideration as described under the caption “—Merger Consideration.”

THE VOTING AGREEMENTS

The following summary describes the material provisions of the voting agreements.  The descriptions of the voting agreements in
this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the form of
voting agreement which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference.  We
encourage you to read the form of voting agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the
information about the voting agreement that is important to you.  The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the
express terms of the voting agreements and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement. 

In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent entered into voting agreements with Chet Kapoor, our chief
executive officer; certain affiliates of Mr.  Kapoor; Tim Wan, our chief financial officer; Stacey Giamalis, our chief counsel; Anant
Jhingran, our chief technology officer; Shankar Ramaswamy, our vice president of engineering and operations; entities affiliated with
Bay Partners and Neal Dempsey, a member of our board of directors; entities affiliated with Norwest Venture Partners and Promod
Haque, a member of the board of directors of the Company; and entities affiliated with Third Point Partners and Robert Schwartz, a

14,555,749 shares of Apigee common stock which represented voting power over approximately 47% of the outstanding Apigee
common stock. 

Voting Provisions

Each party that has entered into the voting agreements with Parent has agreed to (1) appear at each meeting of the stockholders of
the Company concerning proposals related to the Merger, any acquisition proposal or those proposals as set forth in the voting
agreements and (2) vote or cause to be voted (including by proxy or written consent, if applicable) all of his, her or its shares of
common stock (a) in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger; (b) against any acquisition proposal, or any other transaction, proposal, agreement or action made in
opposition to adoption of the Merger Agreement; and (c) against any other action, agreement or transaction, that is intended to impede,
interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or the performance by such stockholder of his, her or its obligations under such voting agreement (the “transaction approval
matters”). 

Irrevocable Proxy

Each party that has entered into the voting agreements with Parent has appointed Parent and its designee as such person’s
attorney-in-fact and proxy to vote shares of common stock owned by such person in accordance with the terms of the voting
agreements. 

Restrictions on Transfer

Pursuant to each of the voting agreements, absent the prior written consent of Parent, each party agreed that, until the earlier of
(1) the termination of the Merger Agreement; (2) the mutual written consent of the Parent and the signing party; and (3) the approval
and adoption of the Merger Agreement by the requisite affirmative vote of stockholders each party will not, directly or indirectly, sell,
transfer, assign, tender in any tender or exchange offer, pledge, hypothecate, exchange or otherwise dispose of (including by merger,
consolidation, testamentary disposition, operation of law or otherwise), either voluntarily or involuntarily (a “transfer”), or enter into
any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the direct or indirect transfer of any of their shares of
common stock (including shares of common stock the party purchases or with respect to which the party otherwise acquires record or
beneficial ownership after the date of the voting agreement and prior to the termination of the voting agreement) other than any transfer
or other disposition to certain permitted transferees, but only if (a) such permitted transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms
of the voting agreement as if

they were a party thereto; (b) such written instrument expressly provides Parent with the ability to enforce the obligations of the
transferring party and the permitted transferee with respect to the party’s shares of common stock (including shares of common stock
the party purchases or with respect to which the party otherwise acquires record or beneficial ownership after the date of the voting
agreement and prior to the termination of the voting agreement), including causing such shares of common stock to vote in accordance
with the voting provisions described above; and (c) prompt notice of such transfer to such permitted transferee is delivered to Parent
pursuant to the terms of the voting agreement. 

Non-Solicitation

Pursuant to the voting agreements with entities affiliated with Bay Partners and Neal Dempsey, a member of our board of
directors; entities affiliated with Norwest Venture Partners and Promod Haque, a member of our board of directors; and entities
affiliated with Third Point Partners and Robert Schwartz, a member of the board of directors of the Company, each such foregoing
entity who is party to a voting agreement agreed not to, and agreed to cause the affiliates, subsidiaries and representatives of such party
not to, during the term of the voting agreement (1) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, knowingly facilitate or knowingly induce
the making, submission or announcement of any acquisition proposal or making of any inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction with respect to the Company; (2) furnish to any third party any
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with an acquisition proposal or acquisition
transaction, or any inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal or acquisition

proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction; (3) participate or engage in
any discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction or any inquiry, offer
or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction, or (4) enter into any
agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction (other than the voting agreements with Parent).  Each
such party is required to promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of becoming aware of the following) notify Parent of (x) any
acquisition proposal received by such party or any subsidiary, affiliate or representative of such party or (y) any inquiry, proposal, offer
or other communication made to such party or any subsidiary, affiliate or representative of such party with respect to, or which would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any acquisition proposal, and shall include in such notice the terms and conditions of the acquisition
proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the person or group making the acquisition proposal or inquiry. 

Company Board Recommendation Change

Pursuant to each of the voting agreements, each party thereto has agreed that if the Board of Directors has effected (and not
withdrawn) a company board recommendation change (as defined under the caption “The Merger Agreement—The Board of
Directors’ Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change”), then the obligation of the party to vote his, her or its shares
of common stock with regard to the transaction approval matters shall be modified such that (1) the party together with the other
parties entering into voting agreements with Parent, shall only be required to collectively vote an aggregate number of such parties’
shares of common stock equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of the total voting power of the outstanding common stock of the Company
as of the Record Date; and (2) the number of shares of common stock subject to the voting requirements of such party’s voting
agreement and all other parties’ voting agreements in excess of that percentage shall be reduced on a pro rata basis in accordance with
the number of votes such party and each other party is entitled to cast, and such party, in his, her or its sole discretion, shall be entitled
to vote all of such excess shares of common stock in any manner such party chooses.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock, as of October 7,
2016, for (1) each person or group of affiliated persons know by Apigee to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common
stock; (2) each of our named executive officers; (3) each of our directors and nominees for director; and (4) all of our current executive
officers and directors as a group. 

We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC, and thus it represents sole or shared voting or
investment power with respect to our securities.  Unless otherwise indicated below, to our knowledge, the persons and entities named
in the table have sole voting and sole investment power with respect to all shares that they beneficially owned, subject to community
property laws where applicable. 

We have based our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership on 30,910,251 shares of our common stock outstanding
as of October 7, 2016.  We have deemed shares of our common stock subject to stock options that are currently exercisable or
exercisable within 60 days of October 7, 2016, which are subject to vesting conditions expected to occur within 60 days of October 7,
2016 to be outstanding and to be beneficially owned by the person holding the stock option for the purpose of computing the
percentage ownership of that person.  We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage
ownership of any other person. 

Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table below is c/o Apigee Corporation, 10 S.

per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”) then outstanding (other than Excluded Shares (as defined below)) will
thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right to receive seventeen Dollars and forty cents ($17.40) in cash, without interest (the
“Merger Consideration”).

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Company Board”) has (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (iii) approved the

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s
willingness to enter into this Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders of the Company are entering into a Voting Agreement (the

such stockholder has agreed to vote all of the Shares controlled by such stockholder in favor of the approval of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and against any other Acquisition Proposal.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
set forth herein, as well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and

(i) Certificate of Incorporation. Subject to the terms of Section 7.10, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth in Exhibit A hereto and such amended

amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and such Certificate of Incorporation.

(ii) Bylaws. Subject to the terms of Section 7.10, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws; provided,
however, that at the Effective Time the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be “Apigee Corporation.”

(b) Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

(i) Directors. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

(ii) Officers. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger

Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed.

Section 1.3 General Effects of the Merger. The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all of the property,

virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or any other Person, other than as

immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Shares resulting from the deemed exercise of the Warrant in accordance with
Section 1.4(d), but excluding (i) Cancelled Shares or (ii) Dissenting Shares, which Dissenting Shares shall have only those rights set
forth in Section 1.4(b)(iii) (the Shares described in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, “Excluded Shares”)) shall be canceled
and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of the certificate, if
any, representing such Share or the transfer of such non-certificated Shares represented by book entry (“Uncertificated Shares”) in the
manner provided in Section 2.2(c) (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if
required) in the manner provided in Section 2.2(d)); provided, however, that the Merger Consideration and other similarly dependent
items shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or
other like change with respect to Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time; provided, further, that nothing in the foregoing proviso shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration issuable in respect thereof pursuant to this Section 1.4(b)(i). The Merger
Consideration issued upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of
the Surviving Corporation of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
certificate representing Shares is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, then such certificate shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.4(b).

(ii) Cancelled Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, or any other Person, each Share that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, including any Shares
held in the treasury of the Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, in
each case immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Cancelled Shares”), shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(iii) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of
adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the “Dissenting Shares” until such time as such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder’s appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares)
shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (in such case, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with regard thereto
except with regard to such holders’ right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by Section 262 of the
DGCL); provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder’s
right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4(b)(i), without interest thereon, upon
surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The
Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares (or written
threats thereof), any written withdrawal or purported withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law that relates to such

(i) Stock Options. Except as provided in this Section 1.4(c)(i) no outstanding Company Options (whether vested or
unvested) shall be assumed, continued or substituted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any Company Option with an applicable exercise price per Share that is equal to or exceeds the Merger
Consideration shall be immediately cancelled at the Effective Time without any cash payment or other consideration being made in
respect thereof. The Company agrees to cause the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to adopt any resolutions and take any
actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.4(c)(i). The cancellation or substitution, as applicable, of a
Company Option as provided in this Section 1.4(c)(i) shall be deemed the termination, and satisfaction in full of, any and all rights the
holder had or may have had in respect of such Company Option.

(A) Vested Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted into, and shall become a right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of
(A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Share of such Vested Company Option, multiplied by (y) the total number
of Shares issuable upon the exercise in full of such Vested Company Option (the “Vested Option Consideration”). As soon as
practicable (and in no event more than thirty calendar days) following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
to each holder of a Vested Company Option the Vested Option Consideration (if any), less applicable Taxes.

(B) Unvested Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (x) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Share of such Unvested Company
Option, multiplied by (y) the total number of Shares issuable upon the exercise in full of such Unvested Company Option (the
“Unvested Option Consideration”), with payment of such Unvested Option Consideration, less applicable Taxes, to be made in
accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided,
that such holder remains employed by or otherwise in service to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries on
each applicable vesting date, subject to the terms and conditions of the Unvested Payment Plan.

(ii) Restricted Stock Units. Except as provided in this Section 1.4(c)(ii) no outstanding Restricted Stock Units shall be
assumed, continued or substituted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. The Company agrees to cause the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) to adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.4(c)
(ii). The cancellation or assumption, as applicable, of an award of Restricted Stock Units as provided in this Section 1.4(c)(ii) shall be
deemed the termination, and satisfaction in full of, any and all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of such award of
Restricted Stock Units.

(A) At the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Unit held by an individual who is an active employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be assumed and converted into an Alphabet Stock Unit to acquire Alphabet Common Stock in respect of that number of shares of
Alphabet Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such Restricted Stock Unit multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. Each Alphabet Stock Unit
so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall continue to be subject to, the same terms and conditions

as applied to the Restricted Stock Unit prior to the Effective Time (but, taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the
Company Equity Incentive Plans or in the underlying award agreement by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby).

(B) At the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Unit held by an individual who is a former employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than an individual described in Section 1.4(c)(ii)(C)(y))
which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the total number of Shares subject to such award of Restricted Stock Units (the
“Restricted Stock Unit Consideration”). As soon as practicable (and in no event more than thirty calendar days) following the Closing,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder of Restricted Stock Units the Restricted Stock Unit Consideration,
less any applicable Taxes.

(C) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Unit held by (x) a Person other than an
individual described in Section 1.4(c)(ii)(A) or Section 1.4(c)(ii)(B) (y) any non-employee member of the Company Board or any
consultant or independent contractor to the Company or its Subsidiaries which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall vest and be settled in shares of Company Common Stock and each such share of Company Common Stock shall be treated in
accordance with Section 1.4(b) hereof.

Restricted Stock Units subject to Section 1.4(c)(ii) hereof any required notices setting forth such holders’ rights, if any, pursuant to the
Unvested Payment Plan or Company Equity Incentive Plan, as applicable, and award documents and stating that such Unvested
Company Options have been cancelled for no consideration pursuant to the first paragraph of Section 1.4(c)(i), assumed and converted
into the right to receive Unvested Option Consideration pursuant to the Unvested Payment Plan or that such Restricted Stock Units
have been assumed and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this
Section 1.4(c) after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the relevant Company Equity Incentive Plan). Unless otherwise
determined by Alphabet in its sole discretion prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall cause Alphabet to assume the Company Equity
Incentive Plans effective as of the Effective Time and subject to adjustment based on the Stock Award Exchange Ratio.

(iv) Company ESPP. With respect to the Company ESPP, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) will adopt resolutions or take other actions as may be required to provide that (A) the
Purchase Period (as defined in the Company ESPP) in effect as of the date hereof shall be the final Purchase Period (such period, the
“Final Purchase Period”) and no further Purchase Period will commence pursuant to the Company ESPP after the date hereof, (B) each
individual participating in the Final Purchase Period on the date of this Agreement will not be permitted to (x) increase his or her
payroll contribution rate pursuant to the Company ESPP from the rate in effect when the Final Purchase Period commenced or
(y) make separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement, except as may be
required by Applicable Law. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all action that may be necessary to, effective upon the
consummation of the Merger, (A) cause the Final Purchase Period, to the extent that it would otherwise be outstanding at the Effective
Time, to be terminated no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs; (B) make any pro rata
adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the Final Purchase Period, but otherwise treat the Final Purchase Period as a fully effective
and completed Purchase Period for all purposes pursuant to the Company ESPP; and (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the Company
ESPP. On such exercise date, the Company will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the Company ESPP within each
participant’s payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and
such Shares will be entitled to the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4(b) of this Agreement. Immediately prior to and
effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), the Company will terminate the Company ESPP.

(d) Warrant. No outstanding Warrant (whether vested or unvested) shall be assumed, continued or substituted by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation. Any Warrant that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, with an applicable exercise
price per Share that is less than the Merger Consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into, and shall become a right to receive, such
number of Shares as calculated in accordance with Section 1.2 and Section 1.6 of the Warrant and such Shares (if any) issued or
issuable as a result of such deemed exercise of the Warrant shall be deemed to be Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Warrant
with an applicable exercise price per Share that is equal to or exceeds the Merger Consideration shall be immediately cancelled at the
Effective Time without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof. The Company agrees to cause the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) to adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions
of this Section 1.4(d), including delivering written notice, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, to each holder of a Warrant, in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Warrant, informing such holders of the effect of the Merger on the Warrant. The Company
shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such notice prior to delivery of such notice to the holders of
the Warrant. The cancellation or substitution, as applicable, of a Warrant as provided in this Section 1.4(d) shall be deemed the
termination, and satisfaction in full of, any and all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of such Warrant.

Section 1.5 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes or intent of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,

shall have the authority to take all such lawful and necessary action.

Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent additional cash in any amount
necessary to enable the Payment Agent to pay any and all Merger Consideration payable hereunder. Any net profit resulting from, or
interest produced by, such deposits shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to this Section 2.2, except as set forth in this Agreement.

(ii) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the
Shares on the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any
holders of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore exchanged their Shares
for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.4(b) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws), as general creditors thereof, for any payment of and claim to the applicable
Merger Consideration (without interest thereon) to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I. Any
portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Payment Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(a) to pay for Shares for which
appraisal rights have been perfected shall be delivered to Parent promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) of Parent’s
demand to the Payment Agent therefore; provided that in such case, until six (6) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available to the Payment Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of such Shares to any holder thereof that
withdraws or otherwise loses appraisal rights as set forth in this Agreement.

(c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time whose shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i): (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of a certificate or certificates (the
“Certificates”) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (excluding Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares) (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(d)) or transfer of Uncertificated Shares
(excluding Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) to the Payment Agent (as evidenced by receipt by the Payment Agent of an
“agent’s message” in customary form or such other evidence as the Payment Agent may reasonably request); and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of Article I. Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share (x) in the case of Shares represented by a Certificate, upon surrender to the Payment Agent of such
Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be
requested by the Payment Agent or (y) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares promptly following the Closing.
Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, from and after the Effective Time each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions
of Article I. If Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Article I. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with
customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Payment Agent (or if subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to Section 2.2(b)(ii), Parent) shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the Payment Agent or Parent, as the case may be) of

that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration issuable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.4(b)(i); provided, however,
that the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Payment Agent may, in their respective discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(e) Transferred Shares. If a transfer of ownership of Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered in the stockholder books or ledger of the Company, it shall be a
condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or
such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred (in each case, accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the
Payment Agent or Parent) and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Payment Agent or Parent any transfer or other
similar Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
or establish to the satisfaction of the Payment Agent or Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(f) Tax Withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of the Payment Agent,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under Applicable Law. To the extent that such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(g) No Liability. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Shares for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law.

business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities
make such qualification necessary (to the extent the “good standing” concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the
United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent
complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation (the “Charter”) and bylaws (the “Bylaws”), as amended to date, of the
Company. The Charter and Bylaws are in full force and effect on the date of this Agreement. The Company is not in violation of its

principles of equity (collectively, the “Enforceability Limitations”).

comparable anti-takeover provision of the Charter, the Bylaws or any comparable governing documents of any of the Company’s
Subsidiaries, applies to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the

Company’s management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting
controls utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

Company Filing so that such filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, then the party that discovers such information will promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
to such filing describing such information will be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the appropriate party and, to the extent
required by applicable law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders provided that, except in connection with

Proxy Statement by the SEC or its staff) and (ii) the first Business Day following the record date (provided, that, such record date is at
least ten calendar days from the date of the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement)).

(vi) If the Company determines that it is required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC
in connection with the Merger pursuant to Applicable Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an “Other Required
Company Filing”), then the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company
Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company
Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and
Nasdaq. Except in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change or thereafter, the Company may not file any Other
Required Company Filing with the SEC without first providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon, which comments shall be considered by the Company in good faith.

(b) Stockholder Meeting.

(i) The Company will take all necessary action in accordance with the DGCL, the Charter, the Bylaws and the rules
of Nasdaq to establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders as promptly as

Company Stockholder Meeting only if (A) there are not holders of a sufficient number of Shares present or represented by proxy at the
Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting, (B) the Company is required to postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by Applicable Law, order or a request from the SEC or its staff, or (C) the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is required by
Applicable Law to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, including, if the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is required by Applicable Law in order to give the Company Stockholders
sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company Stockholders or otherwise made
available to the Company Stockholders (including in connection with any Company Board Recommendation Change). In no event will
the Company Stockholder Meeting be postponed or adjourned (i) by more than ten (10) calendar days at a time without the prior
written consent of Parent; (ii) with respect to Section 7.1(b)(ii)(A), by more than thirty (30) calendar days after the date on which the
Company Stockholder Meeting was (or was required to be) originally scheduled without the prior written consent of Parent or (iii) with
respect to Section 7.1(b)(ii)(C), by more than ten (10) Business Days, or such other amount of time reasonably agreed by the Company

shall the Company Stockholder Meeting be postponed or adjourned to a date that is later than six (6) Business Days prior to the
Termination Date (as the same may be extended). The Company shall, at the instruction of Parent, postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to adopt this Agreement to
allow reasonable time for the solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. Any additional
postponements or adjournments shall be by mutual agreement of Parent and the Company. In no event will the record date of the
Company Stockholder Meeting be changed without Parent’s prior written consent, unless required by Applicable Law.

stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

(iv) The Company shall solicit from Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in
accordance with Delaware Law, and unless the Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The
Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting
results following dissemination of the definitive Proxy Statement. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Article IX,
the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose
of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, whether or not the Company Board at any time
subsequent to the date hereof shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change or otherwise shall determine that this
Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that the Company Stockholders reject it.

(c) Board Recommendation.

(i) Subject to the provisions of this Section 7.1(c), (A) the Company Board shall (x) recommend that the Company’s

manner that is materially adverse to Parent, (2) approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt
or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction other than the Merger, (3) enter into an Acquisition Agreement, or
(4) refrain from recommending against (and reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation) any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Transaction that is a tender offer or exchange offer within 10 Business Days after the commencement thereof (the actions
or inactions referred to in the preceding clauses (1) through (4) being referred to herein as a “Company Board Recommendation
Change”).

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval the Company Board may (x) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in respect of an Acquisition
Transaction that the Company Board has determined is a Superior Proposal or (y) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(f) to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, subject, in the case of the
preceding clause (y), to the prior or concurrent payment of the Company Termination Fee, only if:

(A) the Company Board has received a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this
Agreement that did not result from a breach (or deemed breach) of Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.2;

(B) The Company Board (1) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and its
outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (2) determines in good faith (after consultation with its

determinations and any public announcement thereof shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change unless and until
such party shall have failed at or prior to one Business Day following the end of the period referred to in (C) and, if applicable, (E),
below (and upon the occurrence of such failure, such determination and such public announcement shall constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change) to publicly announce that it (x) was recommending that the Company’s stockholders adopt this Agreement
and approve the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) has determined that such Acquisition Proposal is not a Superior Proposal and
has publicly rejected such Acquisition Proposal (taking into account in (x) any modifications or adjustments made to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and agreed to by the parties hereto and in (y) any modifications or adjustments made to such
Acquisition Proposal));

(C) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination of this Agreement, the
Company Board shall have given Parent at least four (4) Business Days’ notice of its intention to effect such action pursuant to this
Section 7.1(c)(ii) (the “Notice Period”) (which notice shall include the most current version of the proposed definitive agreement and,
to the extent not included therein, all material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making
such Superior Proposal);

(D) if requested by Parent, during the Notice Period, the Company shall have met and negotiated in good faith
with Parent regarding modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to be a
Superior Proposal;

(E) prior to the end of the Notice Period, Parent shall not have made a counter-offer or proposal in writing and
in a manner that, if accepted by the Company, would form a binding contract, that the Company Board determines (after consultation
with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) is at least as favorable to the Company Stockholders as such Superior Proposal
(it being understood that (x) any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, shall require a
new notice pursuant to clause (C) above, except such new Notice Period shall be three (3) Business Days, (y) the Notice Period shall be
extended, if applicable, to the extent necessary to ensure that at least three (3) Business Days remain in the Notice Period subsequent to

and

(F) the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and after considering any
counter-offer or proposal made by Parent pursuant to clause (E) above), that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure to either
(i) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or (ii) terminate this Agreement and enter into the Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, the Company may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other than pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii),
in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law only if:

(A) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance to the
effect that the Company Board has (A) made a determination pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(iii); and (B) resolved to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(iii), which notice will describe the Intervening Event in reasonable
detail; and

(B) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and its Representatives,
during such four (4) Business Day period, have if requested by Parent, negotiated in good faith with Parent and its Representatives
regarding modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board no longer determines in good faith
that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties pursuant to Applicable Law;.

Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 under
the Exchange Act or (B) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with Applicable Law (including
fiduciary duties); provided, however, that any statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange
Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any Company Board
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(ii) or

Section 7.1(c)(iii); provided, further, for the avoidance of doubt, that it shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change
for the Company Board to make a “stop, look and listen” communication pursuant to Rule 14d9-f or any similar communication. For
the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes the Company’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto (in which the Company indicates that it has not changed the Company Board
Recommendation) shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a Company Board Recommendation Change; it being understood that any
disclosure contemplated by the foregoing relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure.

Section 7.2 Regulatory Approvals.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company shall file or cause to be filed with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) as required by the HSR Act (such filing to be made
within fifteen (15) Business Days following the date of this Agreement), as well as comparable pre-merger notification filings, forms
and submissions that are required in the Relevant Antitrust Jurisdictions. Subject to this Section 7.2, each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain clearance of the Merger by the Termination Date (as the same may be
extended).

reasonable best efforts to (a) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (b) supply the other with any
information that may be required in order to effectuate such filings, (c) supply any additional information that reasonably may be
required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and that Parent
reasonably deems necessary and/or appropriate (d) promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any oral
communication with and provide the other party with copies of any written communications to or from any Governmental Authority in
the U.S. or any Relevant Antitrust Jurisdictions regarding the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as
well as a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection
with, any such written communications), and (e) to the extent practicable, (A) give the other party reasonable advance notice of all oral
communications with any Governmental Authority in the U.S. or any Relevant Antitrust Jurisdictions regarding the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) with respect to any oral communication, a reasonable opportunity to
participate in such discussions, and, to the extent a party hereto does not participate in such discussions, the party having such
discussions shall promptly provide such non-participating party with a summary of such discussions. If any party hereto or Affiliate
thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental Authority with respect to
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or
cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, which shall include providing the other
party with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the views of the other in
connection with, any such written materials, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. The parties may, as they deem
advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section 7.2 as “outside
counsel only.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel and previously-agreed
outside economic consultants of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel or outside economic consultants to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials.

Section 7.2, good faith consultations with the Company in advance of any decisions about communications and strategy in connection
with the Antitrust Laws and litigation matters relating thereto, and the inclusion of the Company at meetings with Governmental
Authorities involving substantive issues under Antitrust Laws, unless (but subject to the foregoing notification and good faith
consultation provisions) the inclusion of the Company is reasonably determined by Parent in good faith to be strategically detrimental
to the ultimate goal of obtaining clearance of the Merger under the Antitrust Laws.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not be required to agree (and the Company
shall neither agree nor permit any of its Subsidiaries to agree without the prior written consent of Parent (and the Company shall, if
Parent so directs, agree, so long as such agreement is conditioned upon Closing)) to (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other
disposition of any of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or
businesses of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, (B) the imposition of any limitation on the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to conduct their respective businesses or own any capital stock or assets or to acquire, hold or
exercise full rights of ownership of their respective businesses and, in the case of Parent, the businesses of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries, (C) payment of any consideration, relinquishment of any right or agreement to any modifications of existing
contracts or entry into new contracts (other than the payment of customary filing and application fees) in connection with obtaining any
waivers, consents, approvals from Governmental Authorities under the Antitrust Laws of any Relevant Antitrust Jurisdiction, or
(D) the imposition of any impediment on Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates under
any Antitrust Laws of any Relevant Antitrust Jurisdiction (clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D), collectively, “Remedies”); provided, that
Parent shall agree to the divestiture of assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are immaterial to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, solely to the extent necessary both to (1) obtain clearances under the Antitrust Laws, or to remove any
court or regulatory orders under the Antitrust Laws, that in each case are impeding the ability to consummate the Merger by the
Termination Date (as the same may be extended) and (2) permit the Closing to occur by the Termination Date (as the same may be
extended), provided, that any such divestiture would be conditioned upon the Closing. Nothing herein shall require Parent (or permit
the Company without the prior written consent of Parent) to litigate with any Governmental Authority.

Section 7.3 Efforts to Close

(a) Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Section 7.2 with respect to
matters related to the Antitrust Laws and clearances and litigation thereunder, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
their reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and to do (or cause to be done), and to assist and cooperate with
the other party or parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VIII to be satisfied or fulfilled, (ii) obtain all necessary consents,
approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Authorities, and (iii) seek all necessary or appropriate consents, waivers and
approvals from Third Parties in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and other transactions

respect to matters related to the Antitrust Laws and clearances and litigation thereunder, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, nor Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates on the other hand, will be required to agree to (and
the Company will not and will not agree to, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to agree to, without the prior written consent of
Parent) the payment of a consent fee, “profit sharing” payment or other consideration (including increased or accelerated payments),
the provision of additional security (including a guaranty), or the relinquishment of any right or any modifications of existing

Section 7.4 Access to the Company. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX and the Effective
Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and after reasonable
advance notice, to all assets, properties, books and records and personnel and Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to any documents or information to the extent that in the reasonable judgment of the Company and its outside legal counsel
(a) any Applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to
such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
other privilege applicable to such documents or information; or (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right to terminate or
accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract provided, further, that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of this clause would apply, which efforts shall
include, if such access or disclosure (x) is prohibited by Applicable Law, using reasonable best efforts to provide such access or
disclosure in a manner that does not violate Applicable Law, (y) would result in a loss of such privilege, using its reasonable best
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much or it as possible) in a manner that would not result in a loss of such privilege,
including to the extent requested by Parent and if applicable, by entering into a customary joint defense agreement that would alleviate
such loss of privilege or (z) is prohibited by an existing Contract, using, to the extent requested by or consented to in advance by
Parent, reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent from the counterparty to such Contract to allow such access or disclosure
or, failing the receipt of such consent or waiver, or otherwise at the request of Parent, shall use reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute disclosure and/or access arrangements. Subject to Applicable Law, the Company will provide Parent with any
reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information of the Company reasonably requested by Parent. Any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 7.4 will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets
of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company’s
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in
connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 7.4. All requests for access pursuant
to this Section 7.4 must be directed to the General Counsel, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company, or
another person designated in writing by the Company. No investigation by the Parent or its Representatives shall affect or be deemed to
be modify or remove the representations and warranties of the Company made in this Agreement.

Section 7.5 Notice of Certain Matters.

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX and the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify
Parent (i) in the event that any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in
any respect, or in the event that the Company has failed to comply with or satisfy in any respect any covenant or obligation to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case to the extent that such failure to be true and accurate, or such failure
to so comply and satisfy, would result in any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 of this Agreement having become
incapable of being satisfied, (ii) receipt of any written notice to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives from any
third Person alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or

inaccurate in any respect, or in the event that Parent or Merger Sub has failed to comply with or satisfy in any respect any covenant or
obligation to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case to the extent that such failure to be true and
accurate, or such failure to so comply and satisfy, would result in any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 or Section 8.3 of this
Agreement having become incapable of being satisfied, (ii) receipt of any written notice to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives from any third Person alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in connection with the

Subsidiaries that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed by Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to any section of this Agreement or that relate to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, that, no such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth
in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the
parties under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to the

Proceedings commenced or threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, directors, officers, Representatives or Affiliates,
in each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement (“Transaction Litigation”) (including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and thereafter keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall (a) give Parent the reasonable opportunity to participate in
the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with Parent with respect to the defense, settlement
and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation. For purposes of this Section 7.8, “participate” means that Parent will be kept apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Company, and Parent may offer
comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation, including the right to review and comment on all material filings
and responses to be made by the Company in connection with such Transaction Litigation and the Company shall in good faith take
such comment or suggestion into account, but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such Transaction
Litigation.

Section 7.10 Directors and Officers Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Existing Agreements and Protections. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
under any and all indemnification agreements set forth in Section 7.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors and officers and (so long as such
indemnification agreements are substantially consistent in all material respects with the form of indemnification agreement made
available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement and a true, complete, correct and unredacted copy of such executed
indemnification agreement is promptly provided to Parent) any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time on the other hand (the “Indemnified Persons”). In addition, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other
similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents)

amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by Applicable Law.

connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent
such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or indirectly to (x) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred
prior to, at or after the Effective Time), or (y) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that if, at
any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a
claim for indemnification under this Section 7.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry, (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being
understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have agreed to not assert that
the Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry),
(ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Person for any legal expenses of other counsel
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving
Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for such Indemnified Person advises that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and such Indemnified Person, such Indemnified Person may retain
counsel satisfactory to them and reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable and
documented fees and expenses of such counsel for such Indemnified Person promptly as statements therefor are received upon receipt
of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay such amount or any other amount paid on behalf of such
Indemnified Person if it is ultimately determined in accordance with clause (B) of the following sentence that such Indemnified Person
is not entitled to be indemnified; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this
clause (ii) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Persons in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such
Indemnified Persons would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, provided that the fewest number of counsels necessary to
avoid conflicts of interest shall be used; (iii) the Indemnified Persons will cooperate in the defense of any such matter at Parent’s or the
Surviving Corporation’s expense; and (iv) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its express written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Section 7.10(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, (A) neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Parent) shall
settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless
such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability
arising out of such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry or such Indemnified Persons otherwise consent and (B) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person if and when a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Person in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by Applicable Law and any and all amounts previously paid on
behalf of such Indemnified Person shall be repaid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person.

(c) Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Company’s current
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, covering each person covered by the D&O Insurance, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are on
substantially similar terms and conditions to those of the D&O Insurance; provided, however, that in satisfying its obligations under
this Section 7.10(c), the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of two hundred fifty percent
(250%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such two hundred fifty percent (250%) amount, the
“Maximum Annual Premium”); provided, however, that that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum
Annual Premium, the Surviving Corporation

shall be obligated to obtain a policy with, in the good faith determination of the Surviving Corporation, the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, the Company, following reasonable consultation with Parent, shall have the right to (and if Parent requests, the
Company shall) purchase a six-year “tail” prepaid policy on the D&O Insurance; provided, however, that, in no event shall the
Company pay, or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay, an aggregate premium for such “tail” policy in excess of the Maximum
Annual Premium. In the event that the Company elects to purchase such a “tail” policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue
to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in which case, the Surviving Corporation (and Parent) shall have no further obligations
under the first sentence of this Section 7.10(c) for so long as such “tail” policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(d) Successors and Assigns. If the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate
with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation
(or Parent) set forth in this Section 7.10.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation or its
successor shall be subject to any limitation imposed by Applicable Law (including any limitation on the Company’s ability to
indemnify its own directors and officers) and (ii) Parent shall have no obligation to maintain the existence of the Surviving Corporation
for any specified period following the Effective Time.

(f) No Impairment; Third Party Beneficiaries. The obligations set forth in this Section 7.10 shall not be terminated, amended
or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the
D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 7.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent
of such affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in
Section 7.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries under the
D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 7.10(c) (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 7.10, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other
persons who are beneficiaries under the D&O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 7.10(c) (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this Section 7.10 shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
under the Charter, Bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable law (whether at law or in equity).

(g) Preservation of Other Rights. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed
that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

Section 7.11 Employee Matters.

(a) Acknowledgment of Change of Control. Parent hereby acknowledges that a “change of control” (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time, as applicable.

(b) Existing Agreements. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) honor all Employee Plans disclosed on Section 3.16(a) of the

Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that
nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as applicable, from amending or terminating any such
Employee Plans, or other compensation or benefits plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise
required by Applicable Law. No provision of this Agreement shall operate as an amendment to any Employee Plan or other benefit
plan maintained by the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries.

(c) Compensation and Benefits Continuation. For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide (i) compensation (other than equity-based
compensation) to each Continuing Employee that is substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation (other than equity-
based compensation) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) health and welfare benefits
to each Continuing Employee that are substantially similar to those health and welfare benefits that are (x) provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time or (y) provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, and
(iii) cash-based severance benefits (other than reimbursement of COBRA continuation costs) to eligible Continuing Employees that are
no less favorable than those provided under the Employee Plans set forth in Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and
designated thereon as a severance plan, guideline or practice as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(d) Service Credit; Etc. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide each
Continuing Employee with credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessors) prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant
(including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement but excluding for purposes of any defined benefit pension
plan); provided, however, that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits.
In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (other than those employee benefit plans that are Employee Plans) (such plans, collectively, the “New Plans”) to the extent
coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”) and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents, and (y) shall allow any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be given full credit under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(e) Company 401(k) Plans. The Company Board shall adopt resolutions providing that no rights to contributions will accrue
after, and that each of the Employee Plans sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are defined
contribution plans intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (the “Company 401(k) Plans”) shall be
terminated, as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date (but conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing). The Company
and Parent shall cooperate in good faith prior to the Closing with respect to the preparation and execution of all documentation
necessary to effect the foregoing termination, and the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on all such documentation. To the extent that the Company 401(k) Plans are terminated pursuant to Parent’s request, the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing Date.

by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company for any reason at a time

that would have been (or would have subsequently become) payable had Parent terminated this Agreement at such time.

set forth in Article VIII that have not been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken
at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date the notice of termination is delivered
as evidenced by written confirmation by those Persons pursuant to Section 8.2(d)) are those set forth in Section 8.1(b) or in
Section 8.1(c) (solely with respect to Antitrust Laws), (y) such failure to be satisfied is due to (A) the failure to receive any required
consent or approval (including the expiration or termination of any waiting period and any extension thereof under the HSR Act) from
a Governmental Authority pursuant to Antitrust Laws or (B) any action (including the enacting, issuing, entry or promulgation of
Orders or Applicable Laws or instituting of proceedings) by any Governmental Authority to enjoin or otherwise prohibit the Merger or

Agreement) that was a principal cause of the failure of the conditions in Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(c).

(ii) Any payment to be made by Parent pursuant to this Section 9.4(b) shall be made by Parent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Company, and shall be made concurrently with the

Section 9.4 are an integral part of this Agreement and the Merger, and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly,

Affiliates and representatives named therein) that receives material non-public information of or with respect to the Company to keep
such information confidential and to only use such confidential information for the evaluation and consideration of an Acquisition
Transaction and the terms of which are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood that such agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the
making of any Acquisition Proposal and shall not prohibit the Company from providing to Parent any of the information required to be
provided under Article VI).

“Acquisition Proposal” means any offer, proposal or indication of interest from any Third Party relating to any Acquisition
Transaction.

“Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) involving: (i) any acquisition or purchase by any Third Party, directly or indirectly, of more than twenty percent (20%) of
any class of outstanding voting or equity securities of the Company (or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, such voting
or equity securities of the Company), or any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in any Third Party (or the shareholders of any such Third Party) beneficially owning more than twenty percent (20%) of any
class of outstanding voting or equity securities of the Company; (ii) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
joint venture, recapitalization, reorganization, extraordinary dividend, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the
Company and a Third Party pursuant to which the Company Stockholders immediately preceding such transaction hold less than eighty

Company or such surviving or resulting entity (or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities representing such
voting power); or (iii) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer or other disposition to a Third
Party of more than twenty percent (20%) of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether measured by fair
market value, revenue generation or net income and including equity investments in Subsidiaries).

“Affiliate” means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under
common control with such Person. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the term “control” (including, with correlative
meanings, the terms “controlling,” “controlled by” and “under common control with”), as used with respect to any Person, means the

Board of Directors
Apigee Corporation
10 Almaden Blvd.
San Jose, CA 95113

Members of the Board:

We understand that Apigee Corporation (“Apigee” or the “Company”), Parent (the “Buyer”) and Merger Sub, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Buyer (“Acquisition Sub”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the
draft dated September 6, 2016 (the “Merger Agreement”), which provides, among other things, for the merger (the “Merger”) of
Acquisition Sub with and into the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Buyer, and each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Company Common Stock”) of the Company,
other than shares of Company Common Stock (i) held by the Company as treasury stock, (ii) owned by the Buyer, Acquisition Sub or
the Company or any of their direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, or (iii) held by a holder who has not voted in favor of
adoption of the Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) collectively, the
“Excluded Shares”), will be converted into the right to receive $17.40 per share in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and
conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock
(other than the Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of
the Company Common Stock.

For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:
 

1) Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company;
 

2) Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company;
 

3) Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company;
 

4) Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior executives of the
Company;

 

5) Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock;
 

6) Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the Company Common Stock with that
of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the Company and their securities;

 

7) Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;
 

8) Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and the Buyer and their financial and
legal advisors;

 

9) Reviewed the Merger Agreement and certain related documents; and
 

10) Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed
appropriate.

We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was
publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for this opinion. We
have further relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that it is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the financial projections, we have assumed that they have been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the
future financial performance of the Company. In addition, we have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with
the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, and that the definitive
Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that, in
connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed
Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated
benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We are not legal, tax, or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and
have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect
to legal, tax or regulatory matters. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to
any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be received by the
holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the Merger. We have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the
assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily
based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date
hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume
any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will receive a fee
for our services, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In the two years prior to the date hereof,
we and our affiliates have provided financing services for the Buyer and the Company, and have received fees in connection with such
services. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Buyer in the future and expects to
receive fees for the rendering of these services.

Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual
wealth management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign
exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial

invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own
account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the Buyer, the Company, or any other company, or any
currency or commodity, that may be involved in the Merger, or any related derivative instrument.

This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with our
customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other
purpose or disclosed without our prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing
the Company is required to make with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with this transaction, if such inclusion is
required by applicable law. In addition, Morgan Stanley expresses no opinion or recommendation as to how the shareholders of the
Company should vote at the shareholders’ meeting that may be held in connection with the Merger or whether the stockholders should
take any action in connection with the Merger. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other
alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available.

Annex C

SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE

§262. Appraisal rights.

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery
of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As
used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean
and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited
with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph
(b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date
fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger
or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and
further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a
merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in §
251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or
consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in
respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository
receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a
national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of
this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of
this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the
subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal
rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of

this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word
“amendment” substituted for the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words
“constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting corporation.”

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in
which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate
of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval
at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who
was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this
title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal
rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing
to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger
or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder
electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of
such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation
who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that
the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent
corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days
thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by §
251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice
did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall
send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of
stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii)
the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective
date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to

Table of Contents

§ 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days
following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal
rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or
assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given
shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders
entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10
days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective
date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder
who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence
an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days
after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and
(d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with
respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement
shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under
subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial
owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name,
file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed
by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the
surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be
given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the
City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who
hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the
constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss
the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless

Table of Contents

(1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2)
the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the
merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with
the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the
Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining
such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of
the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At
any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal
an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid
at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders
entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights
under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts,
to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in
subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the
effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time
provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written
withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after
the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of
the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding
in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand
for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.
