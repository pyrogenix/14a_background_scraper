Dear Fellow Stockholders:   June 5, 2018

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the stockholders of Financial Engines, Inc., which we will hold at our offices at 28 State
Street in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 16, 2018, at 12:00 noon, local time.

At the special meeting, our stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger that we
entered into on April 29, 2018, which we refer to as the “merger agreement,” providing for the acquisition of Financial Engines, Inc. by Edelman
Financial, L.P. in a transaction that we refer to as the “merger.” If the merger agreement is adopted and the merger is completed, each share of our
common stock (other than certain shares specified in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive $45.00 per share in cash, without
interest and subject to required withholding taxes, representing a premium of approximately 41% over the trailing 90-day volume weighted average
price of our common stock for the period ended April 27, 2018, the last trading day prior to the execution of the merger agreement.

The Financial Engines, Inc. board of directors unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement and “FOR” the other matters to be considered at the special meeting.

The enclosed proxy statement describes the merger agreement, the merger and related matters, and attaches a copy of the merger agreement. We
urge stockholders to read the entire proxy statement carefully, as it sets forth the details of the merger agreement and other important information related
to the merger.

Your vote is very important. The merger cannot be completed unless a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at
the special meeting vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If you fail to vote in person or by proxy, or fail to instruct your broker
on how to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

On behalf of the entire board of directors, I want to thank you for your continued support.
 

Sincerely,

Lawrence M. Raffone
President and Chief Executive Officer

Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved the
merger, passed upon the merits or fairness of the merger, the merger agreement or the other transactions contemplated thereby or passed upon
the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

This proxy statement is dated June 5, 2018 and is first being mailed to stockholders on or about June 5, 2018.

The Financial Engines, Inc. board of directors has unanimously determined that the merger is advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company and its stockholders, and unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. The Financial Engines, Inc. board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Financial Engines, Inc. vote
(1) “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (2) “FOR” the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that
may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger, and (3) “FOR” the proposal to
approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a
quorum. If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote on a proposal, your proxy will be voted “FOR” each of
the foregoing proposals in accordance with the recommendation of the Financial Engines, Inc. board of directors.

Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of common stock you own. The adoption of the merger agreement requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting and is a condition to the completion of
the merger. The approval of the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named
executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger and the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum, each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of
common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon, but approval of these two proposals is not a
condition to the completion of the merger. If you fail to vote in person or by proxy, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how
to vote, the shares of common stock that you own will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special
meeting, which will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Under Delaware law, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of
the fair value of their shares of the Company as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the merger is completed, but only if they submit a
written demand for an appraisal before the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and comply with the other Delaware law procedures
explained in the accompanying proxy statement. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Appraisal Rights.”

You may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote at the special meeting by following the procedures outlined in the accompanying proxy
statement.

Only holders of record of Financial Engines, Inc. common stock as of the close of business on June 1, 2018, the record date for the special
meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting.

Before voting your shares, we urge you to, and you should, read the entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents
incorporated by reference in the proxy statement. If you have any questions or need assistance in submitting a proxy or your voting instructions, please
call our proxy solicitor, Alliance Advisors LLC, at (844) 670-2144.

The Special Meeting (page 23)

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting

The special meeting of stockholders of Financial Engines (referred to in this proxy statement as the “special meeting”) will be held at our
offices at 28 State Street, 21st Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, on July 16, 2018, at 12:00 noon, local time.

Purposes of the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, Financial Engines stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 

 
•  to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 29, 2018, by and among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, which, as

it may be amended from time to time, is referred to in this proxy statement as the “merger agreement”;
 

 

•  to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Quantification of Potential
Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger”; and

 

 
•  to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are

insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or in the absence of a
quorum.

Our stockholders must adopt the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement, the merger
will not occur. See the sections of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting” and “The Merger Agreement.”

We do not expect that any matters other than the proposals set forth above will be brought before the special meeting. If, however, such a
matter is properly presented at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the persons appointed as proxies will have
discretionary authority to vote the shares represented by duly executed proxies.

Record Date, Notice and Quorum

The holders of record of Financial Engines common stock as of the close of business on June 1, 2018, the record date for the special meeting,
are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 63,716,814 shares of Company
common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.

The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of
capital stock of the Company issued and outstanding on the record date will constitute a quorum for purposes of the special meeting. A quorum is
necessary to transact business at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be
adjourned to a later date.

Abstentions will be counted as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If your shares are held in “street name”
by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee will not
vote on your behalf with respect to any of the proposals, and your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present for the transaction of business at the special meeting.

Table of Contents

Required Vote

Each share of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote on each of the proposals to be
considered at the special meeting.

For the Company to complete the merger, Financial Engines stockholders holding a majority of the shares of Company common stock
outstanding at the close of business on the record date must vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. An abstention with respect to
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, or a failure to vote your shares of common stock (including a failure to instruct your broker, bank or
other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal.

Approval of each of (1) the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger and (2) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of
common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon, but is not a condition to the completion
of the merger. An abstention with respect to either proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals. A failure to return
your proxy card or otherwise vote your shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on
your behalf) will have no effect on these proposals, assuming a quorum is present.

The Company’s directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote their shares of Company common stock in favor of
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do
so. As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, approximately 572,189 shares of
Company common stock, or approximately 0.9% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Proxies; Revocation

Any Financial Engines stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may submit a proxy by telephone or over the Internet, by
returning the enclosed proxy card, or by attending the special meeting and voting in person. If your shares of common stock are held in “street
name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares using the
instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee.

Any proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by submitting a properly executed, later-dated proxy through any of the methods
available to you, by giving written notice of revocation to our Secretary at Financial Engines, Inc., 1050 Enterprise Way, 3rd Floor, Sunnyvale, CA
94089, or by attending the special meeting and voting in person.

The Merger (page 28)

You will be asked to consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex A. The merger agreement provides, among other things, that at the effective time of the merger (referred to in this proxy
statement as the “effective time”), Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger (referred to in
this proxy statement as the “surviving corporation”). In the merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company
(referred to in this proxy statement as the “common stock,” the “Company common stock” or the “Financial Engines common stock”) issued and
outstanding immediately before the effective time

(other than certain shares specified in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive $45.00 per share in cash (referred to in this
proxy statement as the “merger consideration”), without interest and subject to required withholding taxes. Upon completion of the merger, the
Company will be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, the Company common stock will no longer be publicly traded and the Company’s
existing stockholders will cease to have any ownership interest in the Company.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards (page 59)

Treatment of Stock Options. Each Company stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is (x) outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the effective time and (y) granted prior to the date of the merger agreement shall, as of the effective time, become fully vested (to the extent
unvested) and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over
the exercise price per share of such option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company common stock subject to such Company stock
option, subject to applicable tax withholding. Any Company stock option that has an exercise price per share of Company common stock that is
greater than or equal to the merger consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.

Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Each Company restricted stock unit award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time shall, as of the effective time, (i) if granted prior to the date of the merger agreement or held by a non-employee director, become
fully vested and nonforfeitable, and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the merger
consideration in respect of each vested share of Company common stock subject to such restricted stock unit award, subject to applicable tax
withholding or (ii) if granted after the date of the merger agreement as permitted by the merger agreement (other than any such award granted to a
non-employee director), be converted into an award representing the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration in respect
of each share of Company common stock subject to such Company restricted stock unit award (without interest and subject to applicable tax
withholding) on the same schedule, and subject to the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting), as were applicable to such
Company restricted stock unit award as of immediately prior to the effective time.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (page 75)

Each party’s obligation to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver at or prior to the effective time of the following

in the merger agreement;

 

 
•  the performance by the Company in all material respects of the agreements and covenants required to be performed or complied with by

it under the merger agreement at or prior to the effective time;
 

 •  the absence of a company material adverse effect occurring after the date of the merger agreement; and

The obligation of the Company to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the Company at or prior to the effective time
of the following additional conditions:
 

 
•  the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub as of the closing date (except for any representations and

warranties made as of a particular date, which representations and warranties must be true and correct only as of that date), generally

conditions set forth in the two preceding bullet points have been satisfied.

No party may rely, either as a basis for not completing the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or
terminating the merger agreement and abandoning the merger, on the failure of a condition to closing set forth in the merger agreement to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by such party’s failure to act in good faith or to use the efforts to cause the closing to occur as required by the
merger agreement.

Recommendation of the Financial Engines Board of Directors (page 32)

After careful consideration, the Financial Engines board of directors unanimously determined that the merger is advisable, fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, and unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Financial Engines board of directors unanimously recommends that Financial
Engines stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting and “FOR” the other proposals to be
considered at the special meeting.

Reasons for the Merger (page 32)

For a description of the reasons considered by the Financial Engines board of directors in resolving to recommend in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger — Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Financial
Engines Board of Directors.”

(referred to in this proxy statement as “Sandler O’Neill”) rendered its oral opinion to the Financial Engines board of directors, confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion, dated April 29, 2018, to the effect that as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set

The full text of the written opinion of Sandler O’Neill, dated April 29, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and
limits on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. The summary of the opinion of Sandler O’Neill set forth in this
proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company’s stockholders are urged to read the opinion

with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the merger, was directed only to the consideration to be paid in the merger and did not address any
other aspect of the merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder
should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.

and the full text of the written opinion of Sandler O’Neill attached as Annex B to this proxy statement.

Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 50)

In considering the recommendation of the Financial Engines board of directors that Financial Engines stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement, Financial Engines stockholders should be aware that the directors and executive officers of Financial Engines
have potential interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Financial Engines stockholders generally,
including the treatment of their equity awards in connection with the transaction, certain potential severance payments, and the right to continued
indemnification and insurance coverage. The Financial Engines board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other
matters, in making its recommendation that Financial Engines stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. See “The Merger
— Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Limited Guarantees (page 49)

Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, H&F EFS AIV I, L.P. and certain of its affiliated funds (referred to in this proxy
statement collectively as the “guarantors”) entered into limited guarantees (referred to in this proxy statement collectively as the “limited
guarantees”), pursuant to which the guarantors agreed to guarantee, on the terms and conditions set forth in the limited guarantees, Parent’s
obligation to pay any termination fee, reimburse and indemnify the Company with respect to certain expenses in connection with the merger and
pay certain other amounts, in an amount not to exceed $184 million in the aggregate. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
— Limited Guarantees.”

Financing (page 49)

Hellman & Friedman Capital Partners VIII, L.P. and certain of its affiliated funds (referred to in this proxy statement as the “equity financing
sources”) have committed to capitalize Parent, on the date of the closing of the merger, with an aggregate equity subscription of up to $1.45 billion,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in an equity commitment letter, dated as of April 29, 2018 (referred to in this proxy statement as the
“equity commitment letter”).

In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Parent entered into a commitment letter, dated April 29, 2018 (referred to in this
proxy statement as the “debt commitment letter”), with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (referred to in this proxy statement as “Morgan
Stanley”), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (referred to in this proxy statement as “JPM”), Barclays Bank PLC (referred to in this proxy statement as
“Barclays”), Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch (referred to in this proxy statement as “Deutsche Bank”) and UBS AG, Stamford Branch

as the “commitment parties”), pursuant to which each of Morgan Stanley, JPM, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS committed, upon certain terms
and subject to certain conditions, to lend a subsidiary of Parent (referred to in this proxy statement as the “borrower”) $1.905 billion in the
aggregate in connection with the financing of the amounts payable pursuant to the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and
the refinancing of certain debt by Parent and to make available to the borrower a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to
$150 million.

We have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to, and to cause our subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to, and to use our
reasonable best efforts to cause our and our subsidiaries’ representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with Parent’s efforts to arrange the financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter, subject to the terms set forth in the merger agreement.

For more information, see “The Merger Agreement — Financing and Financing Cooperation.”

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 53)

The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger —
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) who receives cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the
merger will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received and (2) the U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the
exchange of shares of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect
of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws). See the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

Regulatory Approvals (page 55)

HSR Clearance. Under the HSR Act and related rules and regulations, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until
notifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (referred to in this
proxy statement as the “Antitrust Division”) and the United States Federal Trade Commission (referred to in this proxy statement as the “FTC”)
and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Completion of the merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. The Company and Parent filed their respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust
Division and the FTC on May 4, 2018, and received early termination of the HSR waiting period on May 16, 2018.

Commitments to Obtain Approvals. The Company and Parent are each required to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to
complete the merger, including cooperating and doing all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain regulatory approvals. This includes, if
required by regulatory authorities, (1) agreeing to sell, divest or dispose of any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company, or their respective
subsidiaries and (2) taking or agreeing to take other actions that after the closing date limit Parent’s or its subsidiaries’ (including the surviving
corporation’s) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or its subsidiaries
(including the surviving corporation). However, the Company will only be required to take or commit to take such actions if they are binding on the
Company only if and when the closing of the merger occurs. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Efforts to
Complete the Merger — Antitrust Matters.”

Table of Contents

Appraisal Rights (page 86)

Under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (referred to in this proxy statement as the “DGCL”), Financial
Engines stockholders who do not vote for the adoption of the merger agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares
in cash as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, but only if they comply fully with all of the applicable requirements of the DGCL,
which are summarized in this proxy statement. Any appraisal amount determined by the court could be more than, the same as, or less than the
value of the merger consideration. Any stockholder intending to exercise appraisal rights must, among other things, submit a written demand for
appraisal to the Company before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and must not vote or otherwise submit a proxy in favor of
adoption of the merger agreement. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights.
Because of the complexity of the DGCL relating to appraisal rights, if you are considering exercising your appraisal rights, we encourage you to
seek the advice of your own legal counsel. The discussion of appraisal rights contained in this proxy statement is not a full summary of the law
pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex C.

Delisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock (page 56)

If the merger is completed, the Company common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market (referred to in this proxy
statement as the “NASDAQ”) and deregistered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (referred to in this proxy statement as
the “Exchange Act”).

Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation (page 66)

Except as permitted by the merger agreement, the Company must not, and must cause its subsidiaries not to, and must use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their directors, officers, employees, other affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or
representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
 

 
•  initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries, discussions or requests with respect to or the making of

any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an “acquisition proposal,” as described in the section
of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation”;

 

 

•  engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an acquisition proposal or “inquiry,” as described in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation,” or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an acquisition proposal, or provide any access to its properties, books or records or any non-public information to
any person relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the foregoing;

 

 
•  enter into any other acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, letter of intent, term

sheet, merger agreement or similar agreement (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement) with respect to an acquisition
proposal;

 

 •  approve, endorse, declare advisable or recommend any acquisition proposal;
 

 
•  take any action to make the provisions of any takeover statute or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in

the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by any acquisition proposal; or
 

 •  authorize, commit to, agree or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.

However, before the company stockholder approval is obtained, if Financial Engines receives a written, unsolicited, bona fide acquisition
proposal that did not result from a breach of the provisions of the merger

agreement described above, then Financial Engines and its representatives may contact the person or group of persons making the acquisition
proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether it constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a “superior
proposal,” as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation — Receipt
of Acquisition Proposals,” and, if the Financial Engines board of directors determines in good faith after consultation (1) with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel that the acquisition proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a superior proposal and (2) with its
outside legal counsel that failure to take the actions described below would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
under applicable law, then Financial Engines and its representatives may:
 

 

•  provide information to such person or group of persons (including their respective representatives and prospective equity and debt
financing sources) if the Company receives from such person or group of persons (or has received from such person or group of
persons) an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms not materially less favorable to Financial Engines than those contained
in the confidentiality agreement to which Parent is subject, except that it need not contain any standstill or similar provision, provided
that Financial Engines must substantially concurrently (and in any event, within 24 hours) make available to Parent and Merger Sub any
non-public information concerning Financial Engines or its subsidiaries that is provided to any such person or group of persons and that
was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub; and

 

 •  engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with that person or group of persons.

Change in Board Recommendation (page 68)

The Financial Engines board of directors has unanimously recommended that Financial Engines stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement. The merger agreement permits the Financial Engines board of directors to effect a “change of recommendation” (as
described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation — Change in Board
Recommendation”) in certain circumstances, as described below.

Before the company stockholder approval is obtained, the Financial Engines board of directors may (1) outside the context of an acquisition
proposal, make a change of recommendation if, upon the occurrence of an intervening event (as described in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation”), the Financial Engines board of directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
under applicable law; or (2) if the Company receives after the date of the merger agreement an unsolicited, written, bona fide acquisition proposal
that the Financial Engines board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
constitutes a superior proposal and such acquisition proposal did not result from a material breach by the Company of the provisions of the merger
agreement described under the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation,” effect a
change of recommendation and/or terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement providing for such
superior proposal, provided that in either case:
 

 

•  Financial Engines must have given Parent at least three business days’ prior written notice that it intends to make a change of
recommendation (referred to in this proxy statement as a “notice of change of recommendation”) and/or terminate the merger
agreement, which notice must specify in reasonable detail the basis for the change of recommendation and/or termination and, in the
case of a superior proposal, the identity of the person or group of persons making the superior proposal and the material terms thereof
or, in the case of an intervening event, reasonable detail regarding the intervening event;

 

 
•  after providing such notice and prior to making a change of recommendation and/or terminating the merger agreement, Financial

Engines must have negotiated, and shall have caused its representatives to

be available to negotiate, in good faith with Parent and Merger Sub (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) during the
three-business-day notice period to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement as would obviate the need
for the Company to effect a change of recommendation and/or terminate the merger agreement; and

 

 

•  at the end of the three-business-day notice period, the Financial Engines board of directors must have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and, with respect to a superior proposal giving rise to the notice of change of
recommendation, its financial advisor, taking into account any changes to the merger agreement proposed in writing by Parent in
response to the notice of change of recommendation, that (1) the superior proposal giving rise to the notice of change of
recommendation continues to be a superior proposal or (2) in the case of an intervening event, the failure of the Financial Engines board
of directors to make a change of recommendation would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law.

See the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation — Change in Board
Recommendation.”

Termination (page 76)

The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned in the following circumstances:
 

 •  at any time prior to the effective time by the mutual written consent of Financial Engines and Parent;
 

 •  at any time prior to the effective time by either Financial Engines or Parent:
 

 

•  if the merger has not been completed on or before October 29, 2018 (referred to in this proxy statement as the “termination
date”); provided that the right to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the termination provision referred to in this bullet
point will not be available to a party if the failure of the merger to have been completed on or before the termination date was
primarily caused by the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under the merger agreement;

 

 
•  if the Financial Engines stockholders’ meeting has been duly held and completed and the company stockholder approval has not

been obtained at the Financial Engines stockholders’ meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on
the adoption of the merger agreement is taken; or

 

 

•  if an order by a court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the completion of the merger has become final and nonappealable; provided that the right to terminate the merger
agreement pursuant to the termination provision referred to in this bullet point will not be available to a party if the enactment,
issuance, promulgation, enforcement or entry of such order, or the order becoming final and nonappealable, was primarily
caused by the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under the merger agreement;

 

 •  by Financial Engines:
 

 

•  at any time prior to the time the company stockholder approval is obtained, in order to substantially concurrently enter into an
alternative acquisition agreement providing for a superior proposal in accordance with the merger agreement, subject to
complying with the terms of the merger agreement; provided that prior to or substantially concurrently with, and as a condition
to, such termination, the Company pays to Parent the company termination fee described below;

termination fee”) in the following circumstances:
 

 •  if all three of the following conditions are satisfied:

(1) the merger agreement is terminated by (i) either Financial Engines or Parent because the merger has not been completed on or
before the termination date or because the company stockholder approval has not been obtained or (ii) Parent as a result of a breach by
Financial Engines of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement, which breach (x) gives rise to the
failure of a condition to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to complete the merger related to Financial Engines’ representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in the merger agreement and (y) is either not capable of being cured before the termination date
or is not cured before the earlier of 30 business days following receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach or the termination
date, and in each case at the time of the termination, the company stockholder approval has not been obtained;

(2) any person has publicly proposed, announced or made an acquisition proposal (or in the case of clause (1)(ii), an acquisition
proposal has been made to Financial Engines’ management or the Financial Engines board of directors (or any committee thereof))
after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the Financial Engines stockholders’ meeting and has not been withdrawn at least
two business days prior to the Financial Engines stockholders’ meeting (and in the case of clause (1)(ii), prior to the breach that forms
the basis of the termination); and

(3) within 12 months after the termination, Financial Engines completes an acquisition proposal or enters into a definitive agreement
for an acquisition proposal that is subsequently completed (even if after such 12-month period)

(provided that, for purposes of the provision referred to in this bullet point, the references to “20%” and “80%” in the definition of
“acquisition proposal” set forth in the merger agreement and defined below are deemed to be references to “50%”);

 

 
•  if the merger agreement is terminated by Financial Engines at any time prior to the time the company stockholder approval is obtained,

change of recommendation or allowed Financial Engines or any of its subsidiaries to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement
(other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement).

Parent Termination Fee (page 78)

Parent will pay Financial Engines the parent termination fee in an amount equal to $181 million if the merger agreement is terminated by

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
 

A: On April 29, 2018, the Company entered into a merger agreement providing for the acquisition of the Company by Parent in a merger for a price
of $45.00 per share in cash, without interest and subject to required withholding taxes. You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with
the solicitation of proxies by the Financial Engines board of directors in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and to approve the
other related proposals to be voted on at the special meeting.

 
Q: As a stockholder of Financial Engines, what will I receive in the merger?
 

A: If the merger is completed you will receive $45.00 in cash, without interest and subject to required withholding taxes, for each outstanding share
of common stock that you own immediately prior to the effective time, unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares.

 
Q: When and where is the special meeting?
 

A: The special meeting will be held at the Company’s offices at 28 State Street, 21st Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, on July 16, 2018, at 12:00
noon, local time.

 
Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
 

A: Only holders of record of Financial Engines common stock as of the close of business on June 1, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, are
entitled to receive these proxy materials and to vote their shares at the special meeting. Each share of Financial Engines common stock issued and
outstanding as of the record date will be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at the special meeting.

 
Q: What matters will be voted on at the special meeting?
 

A: At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 

 •  to adopt the merger agreement;
 

 
•  to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of

the Company in connection with the merger; and

date, and a form of personal identification for admission to the meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” and you also wish to be able to
vote at the meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy, executed in your favor, from your bank or broker.

 
Q: How many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?
 

A: A quorum will be present if holders of a majority of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting
are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the special meeting may be
adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained.

As of the close of business on June 1, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, there were 63,716,814 shares of common stock outstanding.

If you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your shares will be counted
for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.

If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, your
broker, bank or other nominee will not vote on your behalf with respect to any of the proposals, and your shares will not be counted for purposes
of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the special meeting.

 
Q: What vote of Financial Engines stockholders is required to adopt the merger agreement?
 

A: Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business
on the record date for the special meeting.

An abstention with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, or a failure to vote your shares of common stock (including a failure to
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal.

 
Q: What vote of Financial Engines stockholders is required to approve the other proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting?
 

A: Each of (1) the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive
officers of the Company in connection with the merger and (2) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including
to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in
person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon.

An abstention with respect to either proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals. A failure to return your proxy card
or otherwise vote your shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), will
have no effect on these proposals, assuming a quorum is present.

 
Q: How does the Financial Engines board of directors recommend that I vote?
 

A: The Financial Engines board of directors unanimously recommends that Financial Engines stockholders vote:
 

 •  “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;
 

 
•  “FOR” the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive

officers of the Company in connection with the merger; and
 

 •  “FOR” the proposal regarding adjournment of the special meeting.

Table of Contents

For a discussion of the factors that the Financial Engines board of directors considered in determining to recommend in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger — Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Financial
Engines Board of Directors.” In addition, in considering the recommendation of the Financial Engines board of directors with respect to the
merger agreement, you should be aware that some of our directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition
to, the interests of Financial Engines stockholders generally. For a discussion of these interests, see the section of this proxy statement entitled
“The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

 
Q: How do Financial Engines’ directors and officers intend to vote?
 

A: The Company’s directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote their shares of Company common stock in favor of the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.
As of the record date, our directors and executive officers owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, approximately 572,189 shares of
Company common stock, or approximately 0.9% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.

 
Q: Am I entitled to rights of appraisal under the DGCL?
 

A: If the merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly demand appraisal of
their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of
our common stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair
value” of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together
with interest on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court. Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares
are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal
process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section
of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement. See the section of this proxy statement entitled
“Appraisal Rights.”

 
Q: When is the merger expected to be completed?
 

A: As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the merger in the third calendar quarter of 2018. However, completion of the merger
is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the merger, which are described in this proxy statement, and we
cannot be certain when or if the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived.

 
Q: What happens if the merger is not completed?
 

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by the Company’s stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, the Company’s
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will remain a
public company, and shares of our common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and traded on the
NASDAQ. In the event that either Financial Engines or Parent terminates the merger agreement, then, in certain specified circumstances,
Financial Engines may be required to pay Parent a company termination fee in an amount equal to $89 million or Parent may be required to pay
Financial Engines a parent termination fee in an amount equal to $181 million. See the sections of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
Agreement — Company Termination Fee” and “The Merger Agreement — Parent Termination Fee.”

Table of Contents

Q: Why am I being asked to consider and cast a vote on the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that may be paid or
become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger? What will happen if stockholders do not
approve this proposal?

 

A: The inclusion of this proposal is required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (referred to in this proxy statement as the
“SEC”); however, the approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger and the vote on this proposal is an advisory vote
by stockholders and will not be binding on the Company or Parent. If the merger agreement is adopted by the Company’s stockholders and the
merger is completed, the merger-related compensation will be paid to the Company’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms of
their compensation agreements and arrangements even if stockholders fail to approve this proposal.

 
Q: How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of the Company common stock?
 

A: The merger consideration of $45.00 per share represents a premium of approximately 41% over the trailing 90-day volume weighted average price
of our common stock for the period ended April 27, 2018, the last trading day prior to the execution of the merger agreement, and represents a
premium of approximately 32% over the closing price of our common stock of $33.95 per share on April 27, 2018.

 
Q: What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of common stock?
 

A: We urge you to, and you should, read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by reference in
this proxy statement, and to consider how the merger affects you. Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of common stock you
own.

Voting in Person

Stockholders of record will be able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record but instead hold your shares of
common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker,
bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the special meeting.

It is not necessary to attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares. To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted at the special
meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person.

Attending the special meeting in person does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.

Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder

You can ensure that your shares are voted at the special meeting by submitting your proxy via:
 

 •  mail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope;
 

 •  telephone, by using the toll-free number 1-866-883-3382; or
 

 •  the Internet, at www.proxypush.com/fngn.

The telephone and Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m. (Central Time) on July 15, 2018.

If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted “FOR” (1) the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement, (2) the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named
executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger and (3) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

Table of Contents

We encourage you to vote by proxy even if you plan on attending the special meeting.

A failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adoption of the merger agreement.

Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the directions provided by your broker, bank
or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will
not be voted, which will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

 
Q: Can I revoke my proxy?
 

A: Yes. You can revoke your proxy before the vote is taken at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by
notifying the Company in writing, in care of the Secretary, at Financial Engines, Inc., 1050 Enterprise Way, 3rd Floor, Sunnyvale, CA 94089, or
by submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures described above at any time up to
11:59 p.m. (Central Time) on July 15, 2018, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company. In
addition, you may revoke your proxy by attending the special meeting and voting in person; however, simply attending the special meeting will
not cause your proxy to be revoked. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company or by sending
a written notice of revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient
time for it to be received by the Company before the special meeting.

If you hold your shares in “street name” and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, you should instead follow
the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your prior voting instructions. If you hold your shares in “street
name,” you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting in person at the special meeting if you obtain a legal proxy executed in your favor from your
broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the special meeting.

 
Q: What happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?
 

A: The requisite number of shares to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is based on the total number of shares of Company common
stock outstanding on the record date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not vote, or abstain from voting, on the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement, or if you hold your shares in “street name” and fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

The requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of shares of common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon. If you abstain from voting on (1) the advisory (non-binding) proposal to
approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger
and (2) the proposal regarding adjournment of the special meeting, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals. If you do
not return your proxy card or otherwise fail to vote your shares of common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to
vote shares held on your behalf), it will have no effect on these proposals, assuming a quorum is present.

 
Q: Will my shares of common stock held in “street name” or held in another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with

shares I hold of record?
 

A: No. Because any shares of common stock you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder (that is, your broker,
bank, or other nominee) than any shares of common stock you

hold of record, any shares of common stock held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of common stock held of
record. Similarly, if you own shares of common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as
custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of common stock because they are
held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized
officer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the proxy card.

 
Q: What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?
 

A: If your shares of common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card or
voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards and voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies
by telephone or the Internet) to ensure that all of your shares of common stock are voted.

 
Q: What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the merger?
 

A: In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through completion of the merger. Consequently, if you
transfer your shares of common stock before completion of the merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration.

The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the completion of the merger. If you transfer your shares of
common stock after the record date but before the closing of the merger, you will have the right to vote at the special meeting but not the right to
receive the merger consideration.

 
Q: If the merger is completed, how do I obtain the merger consideration for my shares of common stock?
 

A: Following the completion of the merger, your shares of common stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive your portion of the
merger consideration, without interest and subject to required withholding taxes. After the merger is completed, if your shares of common stock
are evidenced by stock certificates, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for the merger with detailed
written instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock evidenced by stock certificates for the merger consideration (without interest and
subject to required withholding taxes). If your shares of common stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may
receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street
name” shares in exchange for the merger consideration (without interest and subject to required withholding taxes).

 
Q: Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
 

A: No. You should not return your stock certificates or send in other documents evidencing ownership of common stock with the proxy card.
If the merger is completed, if your shares of common stock are evidenced by stock certificates, the paying agent for the merger will send you a
letter of transmittal and related materials and instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock for the merger consideration (without
interest and subject to required withholding taxes).

 
Q: Is the merger expected to be taxable to me?
 

A: The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of common stock
pursuant to the merger will

recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received and (2) the U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in such shares. See “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” for a more complete
discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular tax
consequences to you of the exchange of shares of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger in light of your particular circumstances
(including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws).

 
Q: What is householding and how does it affect me?
 

A: The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless contrary
instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each stockholder
continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial
owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already
received a householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies
of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request.
You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.

 
Q: Where can I find more information about Financial Engines?
 

A: You can find more information about us from various sources described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Where You Can Find
Additional Information.”

 
Q: Who will solicit and pay the costs of soliciting proxies?
 

A: The Financial Engines board of directors is soliciting your proxy, and the Company will bear the costs of this solicitation. We will reimburse
brokerage firms and others for their reasonable expenses of forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners of Financial Engines’ outstanding
common stock. The Company has retained Alliance Advisors LLC, a proxy solicitation firm, to assist the Financial Engines board of directors in
the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting, and we expect to pay Alliance Advisors LLC approximately $15,000, plus reimbursement of
out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may be solicited by mail, personal interview, e-mail, telephone or via the Internet or, without additional
compensation, by certain of the Company’s directors, officers and employees.

 
Q: Who can help answer my other questions?
 

A: If you have more questions about the merger, or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of the
proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact Alliance Advisors LLC, which is acting as the proxy solicitation agent for the Company
in connection with the merger, at the telephone numbers, email address or address below.

THE SPECIAL MEETING

We are furnishing this proxy statement to the Company’s stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Financial Engines board of
directors for use at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. This proxy statement provides the Company’s stockholders with the
information they need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting

This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Financial Engines board of directors for use
at the special meeting to be held at our offices at 28 State Street, 21st Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, on July 16, 2018, at 12:00 noon, local time,
or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

For information regarding attending the special meeting, see “The Special Meeting — Voting; Proxies; Revocation — Attendance.”

Purposes of the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, Financial Engines stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 

 
•  to adopt the merger agreement, dated as of April 29, 2018, by and among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub (as it may be amended from

time to time);
 

 

•  to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of this proxy statement entitled
“The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Quantification of Potential Payments and
Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger”; and

 

 
•  to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient

votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

Our stockholders must adopt the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement, the merger will
not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, and certain provisions of the merger agreement are described
in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement.”

The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only, it will
not be binding on either Financial Engines or Parent. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation
will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto under the applicable compensation agreements and arrangements, regardless of the
outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Financial Engines’ stockholders.

We do not expect that any matters other than the proposals set forth above will be brought before the special meeting. If, however, such a matter is
properly presented at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the persons appointed as proxies will have discretionary
authority to vote the shares represented by duly executed proxies.

This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to our stockholders on or about June 5, 2018.

Table of Contents

Record Date, Notice and Quorum

The holders of record of Financial Engines common stock as of the close of business on June 1, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, are
entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 63,716,814 shares of common stock were
outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.

The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting at the close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum. Once a share is represented at
the special meeting, it will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. However, if a new record date is
set for an adjourned special meeting, a new quorum will have to be established. Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be included in the
calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the special meeting.

Required Vote

Each share of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote on each of the proposals to be
considered at the special meeting.

For the Company to complete the merger, Financial Engines stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding at the
close of business on the record date must vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. An abstention with respect to the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement, or a failure to vote your shares of common stock (including a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares
held on your behalf), will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal.

Approval of each of (1) the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s
named executive officers in connection with the merger and (2) the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of
common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon, but is not a condition to the completion of
the merger. An abstention with respect to either proposal will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals. A failure to return your proxy
card or otherwise vote your shares of common stock (including a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your
behalf), will have no effect on these proposals, assuming a quorum is present.

Stock Ownership and Interests of Certain Persons

Voting by the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers

At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of the Company were entitled to vote approximately 572,189 shares of
common stock, or approximately 0.9% of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding on that date and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
The Company’s directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote their shares in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation

Attendance

All holders of shares of common stock as of the close of business on June 1, 2018, the record date, including stockholders of record and beneficial
owners of common stock registered in the “street name” of a broker, bank or other nominee, are invited to attend the special meeting.

Table of Contents

To attend the special meeting in person, you must provide proof of ownership of Financial Engines common stock as of the record date, such as an
account statement indicating ownership on that date, and a form of personal identification for admission to the meeting. If you hold your shares in
“street name,” and you also wish to be able to vote at the meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy, executed in your favor, from your bank, broker or
other nominee.

Voting in Person

Stockholders of record will be able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record, but instead hold your shares of
common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank
or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the special meeting. Attending the special meeting in person does not itself constitute a vote on
any proposal.

Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy

To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by
proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person.

Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder

If you are a stockholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods described below.

Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for submitting voting
instructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the Internet by accessing the Internet address specified on the enclosed
proxy card. Your shares of common stock will be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy
card, as described below.

Submit a Proxy Card. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in time for the special meeting,
your shares of common stock will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card.

If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of each of the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement, the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named
executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger, and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including
to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or in
the absence of a quorum. If you fail to return your proxy card or vote by telephone or via the Internet, and you are a holder of record on the record date,
unless you attend the special meeting and vote in person, your shares of common stock will not be considered present at the special meeting for purposes
of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, which will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement and, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that
may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger, or the vote regarding the adjournment of
the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum.

Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”

If your shares of common stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in “street name,” your broker, bank or other nominee
will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for

Table of Contents

your shares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for their customers to provide voting instructions by telephone or via the Internet, in
addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction form.

In accordance with applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of common stock in “street name” for
their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to (1) the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (2) the advisory
(non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in
connection with the merger, or (3) the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the
absence of a quorum. Accordingly, if brokers, banks or other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such
shares, they cannot vote such shares with respect to these proposals. Therefore, unless you attend the special meeting in person with a properly executed
legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee will result in your shares
of Financial Engines common stock not being present at the meeting and not being voted on any of the proposals. As a result, a failure to vote your
shares of common stock (including a failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf) will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but it will have no effect on the other proposals, assuming a quorum is present.

Revocation of Proxies

Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it before it is voted. If you are a stockholder of record,
you may revoke your proxy before the vote is taken at the special meeting by:
 

 
•  submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures described above at any time up to

11:59 p.m. (Central Time) on July 15, 2018, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company;
 

 •  attending the special meeting and voting in person; or
 

 
•  delivering a written notice of revocation by mail to the Company, in care of the Secretary, at Financial Engines, Inc., 1050 Enterprise Way,

3rd Floor, Sunnyvale, CA 94089.

Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions described above
will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the Company or by sending a
written notice of revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for
it to be received by the Company before the special meeting.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to you by your
broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit new voting instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also
revoke a prior proxy by voting in person at the special meeting if you obtain a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other
nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the special meeting.

Abstentions

An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends the special meeting, either in person or represented by proxy, but abstains from voting.
Abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of common stock present or represented at the special meeting for purposes of
determining whether a quorum has been achieved.

Abstaining from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, a vote “AGAINST” the
advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that may be paid or

become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger and a vote “AGAINST” the proposal regarding the
adjournment of the special meeting.

Solicitation of Proxies

The Financial Engines board of directors is soliciting your proxy, and the Company will bear the costs of this solicitation. We will reimburse
brokerage firms and others for their reasonable expenses of forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners of Financial Engines’ outstanding
common stock. The Company has retained Alliance Advisors LLC, a proxy solicitation firm, to assist the Financial Engines board of directors in the
solicitation of proxies for the special meeting, and we expect to pay Alliance Advisors LLC approximately $15,000, plus reimbursement of out-of-
pocket expenses. Proxies may be solicited by mail, personal interview, e-mail, telephone or via the Internet or, without additional compensation, by
certain of the Company’s directors, officers and employees.

Adjournments and Postponements

Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or in the
absence of a quorum.

Holders of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, whether or not constituting a quorum, and entitled
to vote may adjourn the special meeting. Any adjournment may be made without notice (provided the adjournment is not for more than 30 days) by an
announcement at the special meeting of the time, date and place of the adjourned meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to each stockholder of record entitled
to vote at the meeting. In addition, at any time prior to convening the special meeting, the Financial Engines board of directors may postpone the special
meeting. Adjournments and postponements are subject to certain restrictions in the merger agreement, including that the special meeting may not be
adjourned or postponed to a date that is more than five business days prior to the termination date (as defined below) without Parent’s prior written
consent.

Other Information

You should not return your stock certificates or send in other documents evidencing ownership of common stock with the proxy card. If
the merger is completed, if your shares of common stock are evidenced by stock certificates, the paying agent for the merger will send you a letter of
transmittal and related materials and instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock evidenced by stock certificates for the merger
consideration (without interest and subject to required withholding taxes).

Table of Contents

THE MERGER

The description of the merger in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of
the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. This summary does not
purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger that is important to you. You are encouraged to read the merger
agreement carefully and in its entirety.

Certain Effects of the Merger

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, if the merger agreement is adopted by the Company’s stockholders and the other conditions to the
closing of the merger are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of common stock issued and outstanding
immediately before the effective time (other than shares owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
or Parent, and shares that are owned by stockholders who have properly demanded and not withdrawn a demand for, or lost their right to, appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $45.00 per share in cash, without
interest and subject to required withholding taxes.

The Company common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol “FNGN.” As a result
of the merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be indirectly wholly owned by Parent. Following the completion of the
merger, the Company common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act, following which the Company will
no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to its common stock in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations.

Background of the Merger

As part of its ongoing consideration and evaluation of its long-term prospects and strategies, the Financial Engines board of directors and senior
management regularly review and assess the Company’s business strategies, objectives and key initiatives, including strategic opportunities and
challenges, and have considered various strategic options potentially available to the Company, all with the goal of enhancing value for the Company’s
stockholders. The strategic considerations have focused on, among other things, the business environment facing the Company and its industry as well
as the Company’s business prospects—including resource requirements, the continuing need to invest in the business, challenges, competition and
market forces, including those involved with operating as a public company—and have from time to time included consideration of capital structure,
potential business combination or sale transactions. For purposes of conducting these reviews, and in the ordinary course of business, senior
management of the Company maintains regular dialogues with other industry participants. Periodically, representatives of senior management of the
Company and Parent have engaged in discussions regarding trends and developments in the industries in which they operate.

During the course of 2017, these ongoing strategic discussions of the Financial Engines board of directors focused on exploring possibilities for
maximizing value for stockholders by understanding the potential level of interest of third parties in acquiring the Company. During the fourth quarter of
2017, in consultation with the Financial Engines board of directors, the Company’s senior management conducted exploratory conversations with a
number of potential counterparties regarding a potential strategic transaction with the Company.

On December 19, 2017, an affiliate of Hellman & Friedman and the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement containing customary
provisions, including a customary standstill provision. The standstill provision

Table of Contents

provided that such standstill provision would terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, including the entry by the Company into an agreement
providing for the sale or change in control of the Company.

In January and February 2018, the Company’s management and representatives of Hellman & Friedman discussed Hellman & Friedman’s
potential interest in acquiring the Company, and the Company began to make available to Hellman & Friedman and its representatives certain due
diligence materials with respect to the Company, including the Financial Engines Forecasts (see the section of this proxy statement entitled “— Certain
Financial Engines Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”).

On February 14, 2018, a regularly scheduled meeting of the Financial Engines board of directors was held, which was attended by representatives
of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (“Wachtell Lipton”), the Company’s outside legal counsel. During the meeting, the Company’s management
described recent third-party inquiries and indications of interest regarding a potential acquisition of the Company in response to the exploratory
conversations described above, including with Hellman & Friedman. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed the Financial Engines board of
directors’ fiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection with its evaluation of such inquiries and interest.

On March 12, 2018, a regularly scheduled meeting of the Financial Engines board of directors was held, which was attended by representatives of
Wachtell Lipton. The Company’s management reported on continuing discussions with potential counterparties regarding their interest in a potential
acquisition of the Company. The Financial Engines board of directors also discussed with the Company’s management the potential engagement of
Sandler O’Neill as financial advisor to assist the Company in considering such a potential transaction and alternatives thereto.

In mid-March 2018, two additional financial sponsors, Bidder A and Bidder B entered into separate confidentiality agreements with the Company,
each containing customary provisions, including a customary standstill provision. On March 30, 2018, Bidder C entered into a confidentiality agreement
with the Company, and on April 11, 2018, Bidder D (together with Hellman & Friedman, Bidder A, Bidder B and Bidder C, the “Bidders”) entered into
a confidentiality agreement with the Company, also containing a customary standstill provision. In each case, the standstill provision in the relevant
confidentiality agreement provided that such standstill provision would terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, including the entry by the
Company into an agreement providing for the sale or change in control of the Company.

In March and April 2018, the Company made available to the Bidders and their respective representatives due diligence materials with respect to
the Company, including the Financial Engines Forecasts (see the section of this proxy statement entitled “— Certain Financial Engines Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information”), and the Company and its advisors participated in due diligence discussions with the Bidders and their advisors.

In late March 2018, in response to requests from representatives of the Company for additional specific information from each interested party as
to the level of their interest in acquiring the Company, preliminary indications of interest were delivered by three parties. Hellman & Friedman
submitted to the Company a preliminary non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for $45.00 per share in cash. Hellman & Friedman’s non-binding
proposal also conveyed that Hellman & Friedman would like to combine the Company with Hellman & Friedman’s existing portfolio company,
Edelman Financial, L.P., in order to, among other things, capitalize on opportunities for meaningful synergies. Bidder A submitted to the Company a
preliminary non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for consideration in a range of $43.50—$45.00 per share in cash. Bidder B submitted to the
Company a preliminary non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for $42.00 per share in cash. Bidder B ultimately determined not to proceed
further with its proposal to acquire the Company because the Company’s expectations regarding valuation were higher than the price Bidder B was
willing to pay.

On March 29, 2018, a special meeting of the Financial Engines board of directors was held, which was attended by representatives of Wachtell
Lipton. The Company’s management discussed the Company’s mission,

strategy and performance in executing upon the Company’s strategy, including resource requirements, the continuing need to invest in the business,
challenges, competition and market forces, including those involved with operating as a public company. The Company’s management then reviewed
with the Financial Engines board of directors the preliminary non-binding proposals received from Hellman & Friedman, Bidder A and Bidder B, and
recommended that the Company further engage with Hellman & Friedman and Bidder A, as the Bidders that had submitted the preliminary non-binding
proposals with the highest price per share. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton provided legal advice with respect to a potential transaction. The
Financial Engines board of directors approved the engagement of Sandler O’Neill as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with a potential
transaction, which engagement was subsequently formalized through the execution of an engagement letter, dated April 9, 2018.

During the week of April 1, 2018, at the direction of the Financial Engines board of directors, representatives of Sandler O’Neill engaged in
further discussions with representatives of Hellman & Friedman and Bidder A. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill also discussed with Bidder A the
possibility of partnering with Bidder C or Bidder D with a view to improving its proposal, and discussed with Hellman & Friedman the possibility of
partnering with Bidder B. Also during this week, representatives of the Company distributed a draft merger agreement to Hellman & Friedman and
Bidder A and their respective representatives.

At the direction of the Company’s management, in mid-April 2018, representatives of Sandler O’Neill also participated in discussions with
representatives of Bidder C to discuss a potential transaction with the Company. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill communicated to each Bidder that
the Financial Engines board of directors was willing to review proposals that delivered substantial and certain value to stockholders, that multiple
Bidders had submitted preliminary indications of interest, and that any final proposals submitted by such Bidder should take into account this
competitive dynamic, including with respect to purchase price.

On April 10, 2018, a special meeting of the Financial Engines board of directors was held, which was attended by representatives of Wachtell
Lipton and Sandler O’Neill. The Company’s management and representatives of Sandler O’Neill discussed with the Financial Engines board of directors
the challenges facing the Company’s standalone execution plans, including the current competitive landscape, and other strategic rationales for a
potential transaction. Among other things, the Financial Engines board of directors discussed with the Company’s management and its advisors the
significant risks to future growth and earnings performance posed by the Company’s public reporting obligations and the requirement for substantial
continued investment in the Company to achieve its standalone growth objectives, including to expand its relationships with existing clients and its on-
the-ground retail strategy to reach a broader base of potential clients. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill next reviewed with the Financial Engines board
of directors its preliminary financial analyses of the Company (including, among others, with respect to comparable companies and precedent
transactions in both the asset management and financial technology sectors) and compared the preliminary non-binding proposals submitted by each of
Hellman & Friedman, Bidder A and Bidder B. Sandler O’Neill and the Company’s management noted that despite the outreach to investment banking
firms and potential financial acquirers occasioned by the process conducted by Company management and Sandler O’Neill, the Company had not
received any indications of interest from potential strategic acquirers (other than Hellman & Friedman resulting from its ownership of Parent). Sandler
O’Neill then reviewed a list of theoretically interested strategic acquirers of the Company. The Company’s management and representatives of Sandler
O’Neill discussed with the Financial Engines board of directors that the Company’s unique business model—including the Company’s requirement to
deliver conflict-free advice to clients, which would conflict with potential strategic acquirers’ proprietary products; the Company’s focus on the direct
retail advisory market, which would conflict with potential strategic acquirers’ use of retail intermediaries that compete with the Company; the
Company’s relationships with multiple defined contribution recordkeepers; and the Company’s approach with respect to ownership of client
relationships—limited the interest of potential strategic acquirers in pursuing an acquisition of the Company. The Financial Engines board of directors
discussed, among themselves and with their financial and legal advisors, the business and competitive risks of directly reaching out to potential strategic
acquirers and concluded that, at the current time, the risks outweighed any possible benefits. The Financial Engines board of directors also discussed the
diligence that had been conducted by the Company with respect to each Bidder to

obtain comfort that following the closing of any transaction, the Bidders would continue to properly discharge the Company’s obligations and fiduciary
duties to its clients under ERISA and the Investment Advisers Act. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton then reported on the status of the negotiation of
the draft merger agreements with each of Hellman & Friedman and Bidder A, and provided legal advice with respect to a potential transaction.
Following a discussion, the Financial Engines board of directors directed management to continue negotiations and diligence discussions with each of
Hellman & Friedman and Bidder A.

During the following weeks, the Company made available to Hellman & Friedman and Bidder A and their respective representatives additional
due diligence materials with respect to the Company and participated in due diligence discussions with Hellman & Friedman and Bidder A.

In mid-April 2018, representatives of Sandler O’Neill engaged in discussions with representatives of Hellman & Friedman regarding Hellman &
Friedman’s preliminary proposal and the key terms of a potential transaction, including with respect to purchase price. Representatives of Sandler
O’Neill also engaged in discussions with Bidder A throughout the week of April 15, 2018 regarding Bidder A’s preliminary proposal and the key terms
of a potential transaction, including with respect to purchase price. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill also engaged in separate discussions with Bidder
D in mid-April, 2018 with respect to potentially partnering with Bidder A with respect to a potential acquisition of the Company.

On April 17, 2018, a special meeting of the Financial Engines board of directors was held, which was attended by representatives of Wachtell
Lipton and Sandler O’Neill. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill provided an update of the status of negotiations with each Bidder and reviewed its
updated preliminary financial analyses of the Company. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill explained that Bidder C, which had considered partnering
with Bidder A, had determined to not proceed with a proposal to acquire the Company because the Company’s expectations regarding valuation were
higher than the price Bidder C was willing to pay. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill again reviewed the universe of potential strategic acquirers and
inherent limitations to their interest in a potential acquisition of the Company as a result of the Company’s unique business model. Following discussion,
the Financial Engines board of directors reconfirmed its view that the business risks of directly reaching out to potential strategic acquirers at the current
time outweighed any possible benefits. Representatives from Wachtell Lipton then reviewed the status of the negotiation of the draft merger agreements
with each of Hellman & Friedman and Bidder A.

On April 23, 2018, a special meeting of the Financial Engines board of directors was held, which was attended by representatives of Wachtell
Lipton and Sandler O’Neill. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill and Wachtell Lipton discussed the status of negotiations with each of Hellman &
Friedman and Bidder A (who had elected to partner with Bidder D on the potential transaction) since the prior meeting of the Financial Engines board of
directors. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill explained that the Company had requested final proposals, including with respect to purchase price, from
each of Hellman & Friedman and Bidder A not later than April 29, 2018.

During the course of late April 2018, representatives of Wachtell Lipton exchanged drafts of the merger agreements and the other transaction
documents with representatives of Bidder A and Hellman & Friedman’s counsel and negotiated substantially final terms of such documents.

On April 28, 2018, representatives of Bidder A (who had elected to partner with Bidder D on the potential transaction), informed representatives
of Sandler O’Neill that their final proposed purchase price would be in the range of $41.00 to $43.50 per share. On April 28, 2018, representatives of
Hellman & Friedman informed representatives of Sandler O’Neill that its final proposed purchase price would remain at $45.00 per share, and that
Hellman & Friedman would also permit the Company to pay its regular dividend of up to $0.08 per share until the closing of the merger, which would
deliver additional value to the Company’s stockholders.

On April 29, 2018, a special meeting of the Financial Engines board of directors was held, which was attended by representatives of Wachtell
Lipton and Sandler O’Neill. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill and

Wachtell Lipton updated the Financial Engines board of directors on the status of negotiations with each of Hellman & Friedman, on the one hand, and
Bidder A and Bidder D, on the other hand, since the prior meeting of the Financial Engines board of directors, noting that the negotiations had remained
very competitive until these Bidders had communicated their final purchase price indications on April 28, 2018. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton
reviewed the final terms of the proposed transaction documents, including the merger agreement, the related equity and debt commitment letters and the
limited guarantees. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill presented its financial analyses with respect to the $45.00 per share merger consideration to be
paid in cash to the holders of Company common stock pursuant to Hellman & Friedman’s proposal. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill then rendered an
oral opinion to the Financial Engines board of directors, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated April 29, 2018, that, as of such
date and subject to and based upon the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the consideration to be paid to the holders of Company common
stock in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

After careful consideration and discussion, and taking into consideration the matters discussed during the April 29, 2018 meeting and prior
meetings of the Financial Engines board of directors, including the factors described under the section of this proxy statement entitled “— Reasons for
the Merger; Recommendation of the Financial Engines Board of Directors,” the Financial Engines board of directors unanimously approved and
adopted the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, determined that the merger agreement, the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, directed that the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby to be submitted to a vote at a
meeting of the stockholders of the Company, and recommended that the stockholders of the Company approve the adoption of the merger agreement and
approve the transactions contemplated thereby (including the other proposals set forth in this proxy statement).

On the evening of April 29, 2018, following the meeting of the Financial Engines board of directors, the merger agreement and related transaction
documents were executed and delivered by the parties. On the morning of April 30, 2018, the Company and Hellman & Friedman publicly announced
their entry into the merger agreement via a joint press release.

Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Financial Engines Board of Directors

The Financial Engines board of directors, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, evaluated the merger agreement, the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and unanimously
approved and adopted the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Accordingly, on April 29,
2018, the Financial Engines board of directors unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Financial Engines approve the adoption of
the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby (including the other proposals set forth in this proxy statement).

In the course of reaching its recommendation, the Financial Engines board of directors considered a number of positive factors relating to the
merger agreement and the merger, each of which the Financial Engines board of directors believed supported its decision, including the following:
 

 

•  Significant Value. The Financial Engines board of directors considered that the $45.00 per share price provides stockholders with significant
value for their shares of Financial Engines common stock. The Financial Engines board of directors considered the current and historical
market prices of Financial Engines common stock, including the fact that $45.00 per share in cash represented a premium of approximately
41% over Financial Engines’ trailing 90-day volume weighted average stock price for the period ended April 27, 2018, the last trading day
prior to the execution of the merger agreement, and a premium of approximately 32% over Financial Engines’ closing share price on
April 27, 2018,

and a multiple of total enterprise value to Financial Engines’ Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017 of 17.3x. The
Financial Engines board of directors also considered the merger consideration in light of the current environment in the financial technology
and asset management industry sectors, including but not limited to certain risk factors detailed in the Company’s most recent Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as well as broader macroeconomic trends affecting the Company’s
financial results.

 

 

•  Best Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value. The Financial Engines board of directors considered that the merger consideration was
more favorable to Financial Engines stockholders than the potential value that would reasonably be expected to result from other alternatives
reasonably available to Financial Engines, including the continued operation of Financial Engines on a standalone basis, taking into account
its strategic alternatives and financing plans on an ongoing basis, in light of a number of factors, including:

 

 

•  the Financial Engines board of directors’ assessment of Financial Engines’ business and prospects, its competitive position and
historical and projected financial performance, and the nature of the industries in which Financial Engines operates, including the
competitive challenges of operating as a public company in light of the particular businesses that Financial Engines operates,
including the significant risks to future growth posed by the Company’s public reporting obligations, specifically information
regarding its pricing strategy, and the belief of the board of directors that stockholder value would be maximized by entering into the
merger;

 

 
•  the anticipated future trading prices of the Company common stock on a standalone basis, and the risks of continuing on a

standalone basis as an independent public company, including the requirement for substantial continued investment in the Company
to achieve its standalone growth objectives;

 

 
•  the Financial Engines board of directors’ consideration of the strategic alternatives reasonably available to Financial Engines,

including the results of the process undertaken by the Company with the assistance of its financial advisor with respect to a potential
sale of the Company described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “— Background of the Merger”;

 

 
•  the Financial Engines board of directors’ belief, following consultation with the Company’s financial advisor, that certain

characteristics of the Company’s business model limited the universe of potential strategic acquirers;
 

 
•  the fact that no independent strategic parties had made a proposal or otherwise approached the Company with respect to a strategic

business combination transaction;
 

 

•  the course and history of competitive negotiations between the Bidders and Financial Engines, as described in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “— Background of the Merger,” and the Financial Engines board of directors’ belief that it had obtained
Hellman & Friedman’s best and final offer and that it was unlikely that any other party would be willing to acquire the Company at a
higher price; and

 

 •  the Financial Engines board of directors’ belief that the terms of the merger agreement, taken as a whole, are reasonable.
 

 
•  Greater Certainty of Value. The Financial Engines board of directors considered that the merger consideration is a fixed all-cash amount,

thereby providing Financial Engines stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity for their shares upon the closing of the merger,
especially when viewed in light of a number of factors, including:

 

 •  the increased volatility in equity markets during the first part of 2018, and the even greater volatility in the Company’s stock; and
 

 
•  the nature of Financial Engines’ revenue model, which is related to Financial Engines’ assets under management and is highly

correlated to the stock market.

•  Receipt of Fairness Opinion from Sandler O’Neill. The Financial Engines board of directors considered the oral opinion of Sandler O’Neill
rendered to the Financial Engines board of directors at the meeting of the Financial Engines board of directors on April 29, 2018, confirmed
by delivery of a written opinion, dated April 29, 2018, that as of such date and subject to and based upon the factors and assumptions set
forth in such opinion, the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company common stock in the merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders. The full text of the written opinion of Sandler O’Neill is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. The opinion of Sandler O’Neill is more fully described in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “— Opinion of Financial Engines’ Financial Advisor.”

 

 
•  Likelihood of Completion. The Financial Engines board of directors considered the likelihood of completion of the merger to be significant,

in light of, among other things:
 

 
•  the limited overlaps between the businesses of Financial Engines and Parent relative to those that could be present in transactions

with certain other industry participants;
 

 
•  the commitment of Parent in the merger agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to complete the merger as soon as practicable

(see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Efforts to Complete the Merger”);
 

 
•  the commitment of Parent in the merger agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its equity financing sources and their

affiliates to assist and cooperate as necessary and appropriate with the other parties to complete the merger as soon as practicable;
 

 
•  the commitment of Parent in the merger agreement to pay the Company a termination fee in an amount equal to $181 million in

certain circumstances in the event that the merger is not completed (see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger
Agreement — Parent Termination Fee”);

 

 

•  the fact that Parent has entered into a debt commitment letter pursuant to which the debt commitment parties have committed, upon
certain terms and subject to certain conditions, to lend $1.905 billion in connection with the financing of the amounts payable
pursuant to the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and the refinancing of certain debt by Parent and to
make available to such borrower a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150 million, and the
representations and covenants of Parent in the merger agreement as to its financing (see the section of this proxy statement entitled
“— Financing”); and

 

 

•  the conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement, which the Financial Engines board of directors believed are reasonable
and customary in number and scope, and which, in the case of the condition related to the accuracy of Financial Engines’
representations and warranties, are generally subject to a “company material adverse effect” qualification (see the section of this
proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to Completion of the Merger”).

 

 
•  Opportunity to Receive Alternative Acquisition Proposals and to Change Recommendation in Response to a Superior Proposal or

Intervening Event. The Financial Engines board of directors considered the terms of the merger agreement relating to Financial Engines’
ability to respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals, and the other terms of the merger agreement, including:

 

 
•  Financial Engines’ right, subject to certain conditions, to provide information in response to, and to discuss and negotiate, certain

unsolicited acquisition proposals made before the company stockholder approval is obtained (see the section of this proxy statement
entitled “The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation”); and

 

 
•  the provision of the merger agreement allowing the Financial Engines board of directors to make a change of recommendation prior

to obtaining the company stockholder approval in specified circumstances relating to a superior proposal or intervening event,
subject to Parent’s right to terminate the merger agreement and receive payment of a termination fee of $89 million which

amount the Financial Engines board of directors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances given the size of the transaction
and taking into account the range of such termination fees in similar transactions, and further taking into account the fact that the
Company had engaged with multiple potential acquirers several weeks in advance of entering into the merger agreement (see the
sections of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation,” “The Merger
Agreement — Termination” and “The Merger Agreement — Company Termination Fee”).

 

 
•  Opportunity for Financial Engines Stockholders to Vote. The Financial Engines board of directors also considered the fact that the merger

would be subject to the approval of the Company’s stockholders, and the Company’s stockholders would be free to evaluate the merger and
vote for or against the adoption of the merger agreement at the Financial Engines stockholders’ meeting.

In the course of reaching its recommendation, the Financial Engines board of directors also considered certain risks and potentially adverse factors
relating to the merger agreement and the merger, including:
 

 
•  that Financial Engines stockholders will have no ongoing equity participation in Financial Engines following the merger, and that such

stockholders will therefore cease to participate in Financial Engines’ future earnings or growth, if any, or to benefit from increases, if any, in
the value of the Company common stock following the merger;

 

 
•  the provisions of the merger agreement that restrict the Company’s ability to solicit or participate in discussions or negotiations regarding

alternative acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions, and that restrict the Company from entering into alternative acquisition
agreements;

 

 

•  the possibility that the merger is not completed in a timely manner or at all for any reason, as well as the risks and costs to Financial Engines
if the merger is not completed or if there is uncertainty about the likelihood, timing or effects of completion of the merger, including
uncertainty about the effect of the merger on Financial Engines’ employees, clients, providers, advertisers, partners and other third parties,
which could impair Financial Engines’ ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and could cause third parties to seek to terminate,
change or not enter into business relationships with Financial Engines, as well as the risk of management distraction from ongoing business
operations as a result of the merger, and the effect on the trading price of the Company common stock if the merger agreement is terminated
or the merger is not completed for any reason;

 

 

•  the merger agreement’s restrictions on the conduct of Financial Engines’ business before completion of the merger, generally requiring
Financial Engines to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business
and prohibiting Financial Engines from taking specified actions, which could delay or prevent Financial Engines from undertaking certain
business opportunities that arise pending completion of the merger (see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement
— Conduct of Business Pending the Merger”);

 

 
•  the possibility that Financial Engines could be required under the terms of the merger agreement to pay a termination fee of $89 million

under certain circumstances (see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Company Termination Fee”), and
that such termination fee could discourage other potential bidders from making a competing bid to acquire the Company;

 

 
•  that the receipt of cash by Financial Engines stockholders in exchange for their shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a

taxable transaction to Financial Engines stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes (see the section of this proxy statement entitled
“— Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”); and

 

 
•  that some of the Company’s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of

Financial Engines stockholders generally (see the section of this proxy statement entitled “— Interests of the Company’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger”).

Table of Contents

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Financial Engines board of directors includes the material
factors considered by the Financial Engines board of directors but is not intended to be exhaustive and does not necessarily include all of the
factors considered by the Financial Engines board of directors. In view of the complexity and variety of factors considered in connection with
its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger, the Financial Engines board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not,
quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition,
individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The above factors are not presented in any order of priority. The
explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contain forward-looking statements that should be read in conjunction with the section
of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”

The Financial Engines board of directors unanimously resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Financial Engines approve the
adoption of the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby (including the other proposals set forth in this proxy
statement) based upon the totality of information it considered.

Certain Financial Engines Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

In connection with the Company’s internal planning processes, Financial Engines’ management prepared financial forecasts for the full-year and
each quarter of fiscal year 2018 (referred to in this proxy statement as the “Financial Engines Forecasts”). The Financial Engines Forecasts were
provided to the Financial Engines board of directors and Financial Engines’ financial advisor in connection with their respective consideration and
evaluation of the merger, and the Financial Engines Forecasts were provided to certain affiliates of the guarantors and the equity financing sources
(referred to in this proxy statement as “Hellman & Friedman”) and Parent in connection with their consideration and evaluation of the merger.

Except for quarterly and annual guidance, Financial Engines does not as a matter of course make public forecasts as to future performance, and is
especially wary of making forecasts for extended periods, due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial
performance for future periods and the uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Financial Engines is including in this proxy
statement a summary of certain limited unaudited prospective financial information for Financial Engines on a standalone basis, without giving effect to
the merger, solely because such financial information was given to the Financial Engines board of directors, Financial Engines’ financial advisor, Parent
and/or Hellman & Friedman for purposes of considering and evaluating the merger. The inclusion of the Financial Engines Forecasts should not be
regarded as an indication that the Financial Engines board of directors, Financial Engines’ financial advisor, Financial Engines or its management,
Hellman & Friedman, Parent, Merger Sub or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the
achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such.

The Financial Engines Forecasts and the underlying assumptions upon which the Financial Engines Forecasts were based are subjective in many
respects, and subject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions and based on actual experience and business developments. The Financial
Engines Forecasts, while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous assumptions with respect to company performance, industry
performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject
to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and beyond Financial Engines’ control. Multiple factors, including those described in the section
of this proxy statement entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” could cause the Financial Engines Forecasts or the
underlying assumptions to be inaccurate. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Financial Engines Forecasts will be realized or that actual results
will not be significantly higher or lower than projected. The Financial Engines Forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring
after the date on which they were prepared, including the merger. Economic and business environments can and do change

quickly, which adds an additional significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Financial Engines Forecasts will be achieved.
As a result, the inclusion of the Financial Engines Forecasts in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by Financial
Engines, Financial Engines’ financial advisor or any other person that the information is material. Financial Engines made no representation to
Hellman & Friedman, Parent, Merger Sub or any other person, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the Financial Engines Forecasts. The
summary of the Financial Engines Forecasts is not provided to influence Financial Engines stockholders’ decisions regarding whether to vote for the
merger proposal or any other proposal. The Financial Engines Forecasts should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial
statements and other information contained in Financial Engines’ public filings with the SEC.

The Financial Engines Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward compliance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles (referred to in this proxy statement as “GAAP”), published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither KPMG LLP (referred
to in this proxy statement as “KPMG”), Financial Engines’ independent registered public accounting firm nor any other accounting firm, has examined,
compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the Financial Engines Forecasts, and accordingly, KPMG does not express an opinion or any
other form of assurance with respect thereto. The KPMG report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Financial Engines’ historical
financial information. It does not extend to the prospective financial information contained herein and should not be read to do so.

The Financial Engines Forecasts

Financial Engines’ management prepared non-public, unaudited financial forecasts with respect to Financial Engines’ business, as a standalone
company, for the full-year and each quarter of fiscal year 2018.

The Financial Engines Forecasts are based on the information contained in Financial Engines’ financial model, which was prepared by Financial
Engines’ management in connection with internal planning processes.

The Financial Engines Forecasts were provided to the Financial Engines board of directors and Financial Engines’ financial advisor to assist them
in evaluating the merger and various strategic alternatives potentially available to the Company, including remaining a standalone company.

The Financial Engines Forecasts do not take into account the possible financial and other effects on Financial Engines of the merger and do not
attempt to predict or suggest future results following the merger. The Financial Engines Forecasts do not give effect to the merger, including the impact
of negotiating or executing the merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with completing the merger, the potential synergies
that may be achieved by the combined company as a result of the merger, the effect on Financial Engines of any business or strategic decision or action
that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions
that would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but that were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in
anticipation of the merger. Further, the Financial Engines Forecasts do not take into account the effect on Financial Engines of any possible failure of the
merger to occur.

For the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held several months after the Financial Engines Forecasts were
prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted
reliance on the Financial Engines Forecasts set forth above. No one has made or makes any representation to any investor or stockholder regarding the
information included in the Financial Engines Forecasts. Financial Engines urges all Financial Engines stockholders to review its most recent SEC
filings for a description of its reported financial results. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

In addition, the Financial Engines Forecasts have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date the Financial Engines
Forecasts were prepared (except as set forth above) or as of date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable securities laws, Financial
Engines does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Financial Engines Forecasts or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing
after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error.

Opinion of Financial Engines’ Financial Advisor

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated April 9, 2018, Financial Engines retained Sandler O’Neill to act as an independent financial advisor to the
Financial Engines’ board of directors in connection with Financial Engines’ consideration of a possible business combination. Sandler O’Neill is a
nationally recognized investment banking firm whose principal business specialty is financial institutions. In the ordinary course of its investment
banking business, Sandler O’Neill is regularly engaged in the valuation of financial technology and asset management companies and their securities in

and the merger, Sandler O’Neill delivered to the Financial Engines board of directors its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing on
April 29, 2018, to the effect that, as of such date, the merger consideration set forth in the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of Financial Engines common stock. The full text of Sandler O’Neill’s opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. The
opinion outlines the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken
by Sandler O’Neill in rendering its opinion. The description of the opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the opinion. Holders of Financial Engines common stock are urged to read the entire opinion carefully in connection with their consideration
of the merger agreement and the merger.

Sandler O’Neill’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion is directed to the Financial Engines board of
directors in connection with its consideration of the merger agreement and the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder of Financial Engines as to how any such stockholder should vote at any meeting of stockholders called to consider and vote upon
the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion is directed only to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the merger consideration to the holders of Financial Engines common stock and does not address the underlying business
decision of Financial Engines to engage in the merger, the form or structure of the merger or any other transactions contemplated in the
merger agreement, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative transactions or business strategies that might exist
for Financial Engines or the effect of any other transaction in which Financial Engines might engage. Sandler O’Neill also did not express any
opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to be received in the merger by any officer, director or employee of Financial
Engines, or any class of such persons, if any, relative to the amount of compensation to be received in the merger by any other stockholder. The opinion
was approved by Sandler O’Neill’s fairness opinion committee.

In connection with its opinion, Sandler O’Neill reviewed and considered, among other things:
 

 •  an execution version of the merger agreement, dated April 29, 2018;
 

 
•  copies of the equity commitment letter and the debt commitment letter, both dated April 29, 2018, and the financial terms of the debt and

equity financing in connection with the merger;
 

 
•  certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of Financial Engines that Sandler O’Neill deemed

relevant;
 

 •  certain publicly available information relating to Parent that Sandler O’Neill deemed relevant;
 

 
•  publicly available mean and median analyst adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share estimates for Financial Engines for the years

ending December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019;
 

 
•  certain internal financial forecasts, including estimated adjusted EBITDA, for Financial Engines for the year ending December 31, 2018, as

provided by the senior management of Financial Engines, as well as estimated annual growth rates of pro forma adjusted EBITDA for
Financial Engines for the years thereafter, as discussed with the senior management of Financial Engines;

 

 
•  the publicly reported historical price and trading activity for Financial Engines common stock, including a comparison of certain stock

market information for Financial Engines common stock and certain stock indices, as well as publicly available information for certain other
similar companies, the securities of which are publicly traded;

 

 •  a comparison of certain financial information for Financial Engines with similar institutions for which information is publicly available;
 

 
•  the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the financial technology and asset management industries, to the extent

publicly available;

 •  the current market environment generally and the financial technology and asset management environments in particular; and
 

 
•  such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria as Sandler O’Neill

considered relevant.

Sandler O’Neill also discussed with certain members of the senior management of Financial Engines the business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects of Financial Engines.

In performing its review, Sandler O’Neill relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information that was
available to and reviewed by Sandler O’Neill from public sources, that was provided to Sandler O’Neill by Financial Engines or its representatives or
that was otherwise reviewed by Sandler O’Neill and Sandler O’Neill assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering its opinion
without any independent verification or investigation. Sandler O’Neill relied on the assurances of the senior management of Financial Engines that they
were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would have made any of such information inaccurate or misleading. Sandler O’Neill was not asked to
and did not undertake an independent verification of any of such information and Sandler O’Neill did not assume any responsibility or liability for the
accuracy or completeness thereof. Sandler O’Neill did not make an independent evaluation or perform an appraisal of the specific assets, the collateral
securing assets or the liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Financial Engines or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, nor was Sandler O’Neill furnished
with any such evaluations or appraisals. Sandler O’Neill rendered no opinion or evaluation on the collectability of any assets of Financial Engines or any
of its affiliates or subsidiaries.

In preparing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill used certain internal financial forecasts, including estimated adjusted EBITDA, for Financial Engines
for the year ending December 31, 2018, as provided by the senior management of Financial Engines, as well as estimated annual growth rates of pro
forma adjusted EBITDA for Financial Engines for the years thereafter, as discussed with the senior management of Financial Engines. With respect to
the foregoing information, the senior management of Financial Engines confirmed to Sandler O’Neill that such information reflected the best currently
available estimates of management of the future financial performance of Financial Engines at such time and Sandler O’Neill assumed that such
performance would be achieved. Sandler O’Neill did not express any opinion as to such estimates, or the assumptions on which they were based.
Sandler O’Neill also assumed that there had been no material change in Financial Engines’ or any of its affiliates’ or subsidiaries’ assets, financial
condition, results of operations, business or prospects since the date of the most recent financial statements made available to Sandler O’Neill. Sandler
O’Neill assumed in all respects material to its analyses that Financial Engines would remain as a going concern for all periods relevant to its analyses.

Sandler O’Neill also assumed, with Financial Engines’ consent, that (1) each of the parties to the merger agreement would comply in all material
respects with all material terms and conditions that were pertinent to Sandler O’Neill’s analysis of the merger agreement and all related agreements, that
all of the representations and warranties contained in such agreements were true and correct except as would not give rise to the failure of a condition to
the closing of the merger as set forth in the merger agreement, that each of the parties to such agreements would perform in all material respects all of
the covenants and other obligations required to be performed by such party under such agreements and that were pertinent to Sandler O’Neill’s analysis
and that the conditions precedent in such agreements were not and would not be waived, (2) in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third
party approvals, consents and releases with respect to the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition would be imposed that would have an
adverse effect on Financial Engines, Parent, Merger Sub, the merger or any related transactions, and (3) the merger and any related transactions would
be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without any waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition
or agreement thereof and in compliance with all applicable laws and other requirements. Sandler O’Neill expressed no opinion as to any of the legal,
accounting or tax matters relating to the merger or any other transactions contemplated in connection therewith.

Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to Sandler O’Neill as of, the date thereof. Events occurring after the date thereof could materially affect Sandler O’Neill’s opinion. Sandler
O’Neill has not undertaken to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion or otherwise comment upon events occurring after the date thereof.

In rendering its opinion, Sandler O’Neill performed a variety of financial analyses. The summary below is not a complete description of all the
analyses underlying Sandler O’Neill’s opinion rendered to the Financial Engines board of directors on April 29, 2018 or the presentation made by
Sandler O’Neill to Financial Engines’ board of directors on such date, but is a summary of the material analyses performed and presented by Sandler
O’Neill. The summary includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, these tables must be
read together with the accompanying text. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The preparation of
a fairness opinion is a complex process involving subjective judgments as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances. The process, therefore, is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary
description. Sandler O’Neill believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the factors and analyses to be
considered without considering all factors and analyses, or attempting to ascribe relative weights to some or all of such factors and analyses, could
create an incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion. The order of analyses does not represent the relative importance or weight
given to those analyses by Sandler O’Neill. Also, no company included in Sandler O’Neill’s comparative analyses described below is identical to
Financial Engines and no transaction is identical to the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of comparable companies or transactions involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies and other factors that could affect the
public trading values or merger transaction values, as the case may be, of Financial Engines and the companies to which they were compared. In arriving
at its opinion, Sandler O’Neill did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered. Rather, Sandler O’Neill made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Sandler O’Neill did not form an opinion as to whether any
individual analysis or factor (positive or negative) considered in isolation supported or failed to support its opinion; rather, Sandler O’Neill made its
determination as to the fairness of the merger consideration on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of
its analyses taken as a whole.

In performing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill also made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, business and economic
conditions and various other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Financial Engines and Sandler O’Neill. The analyses performed by
Sandler O’Neill are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, both of which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested
by such analyses. Sandler O’Neill prepared its analyses solely for purposes of rendering its opinion and provided such analyses to the Financial Engines
board of directors at its April 29, 2018 meeting. Estimates on the values of companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at
which companies or their securities may actually be sold. Such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty and actual values may be materially
different. Accordingly, Sandler O’Neill’s analyses do not necessarily reflect the value of Financial Engines common stock or the price at which
Financial Engines common stock may be sold at any time. The analyses of Sandler O’Neill and its opinion were among a number of factors taken into
consideration by the Financial Engines board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the analyses described below
should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the Financial Engines board of directors or management with respect to the fairness of the
merger.

Summary of Proposed Merger Consideration and Implied Transaction Metrics

Sandler O’Neill reviewed the financial terms of the proposed merger. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, upon the effective time, each
share of Financial Engines common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time (other than certain shares specified in the merger
agreement) will be converted into the right to receive $45.00 per share in cash, without interest and subject to required withholding

taxes. Sandler O’Neill calculated a transaction value of approximately $3,018 million, assuming 67.1 million fully diluted shares of Financial Engines
common stock outstanding, comprised of 63.5 million shares of common stock outstanding as of April 27, 2018, 4.6 million options outstanding at a
weighted average strike price of $32.65, and 2.2 million restricted stock units. Sandler O’Neill calculated a total enterprise value of approximately
$2,779 million, assuming $238.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2018, as provided by Financial Engines
management. For purposes of this section, enterprise value is referred to as “EV,” and last twelve months is referred to as “LTM.” Sandler O’Neill
calculated the following transaction pricing multiples based on the per share merger consideration:
 

Total EV / 2017 Adjusted EBITDA    17.3x 
Total EV / 2017 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA(1)    22.3x 
Total EV / 2018 Consensus Adjusted EBITDA(2)    16.2x

Transaction Value / 2018 Estimated Non-GAAP Pro Forma Adjusted Net Income(5)    34.5x 
Implied Premium to Stock Price as of April 27, 2018    32.5% 

 
(1) Reflects 2017 Adjusted EBITDA, less non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $36.4 million.
(2) Consensus estimates reflect Wall Street median consensus analyst estimates.
(3) 2018 Estimated Adjusted EBITDA of $170.2 million, as provided by Financial Engines management.
(4) Reflects 2018 Estimated Adjusted EBITDA less non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $40.0 million per Financial Engines public

guidance.
(5) Reflects 2018 Consensus Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income, less non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $40.0 million ($30.0 million on

an after-tax basis) per Financial Engines public guidance; assumes a 25% tax rate, as provided by Financial Engines management.

Note: Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before net interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, amortization of
intangible assets, including internal use software, amortization and impairment of direct response advertising, amortization of deferred sales
commissions, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, expenses related to the closing and integration of acquisitions, severance and benefits
expenses related to restructuring activities and losses incurred on acquisitions, if applicable for the period; Adjusted net income represents net income
before non-cash stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets related to assets acquired, including customer relationships, trade
names and trademarks, expenses related to the closing and integration of acquisitions, severance and benefits expenses related to restructuring activities,
losses incurred on acquisitions, if applicable for the period, partially offset by the estimated tax impact of these items, and certain other items such as the
income tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances, income tax impacts from non-deductible transaction expenses related to acquisitions, and
the accounting effects of the 2017 Tax Act, if applicable for the period.

Public Company Premiums Paid Analysis

Sandler O’Neill reviewed a group of merger and acquisition transactions involving public companies across all industries in order to compare the
market premium in the proposed merger to similarly sized transactions. The group of transactions included 117 transactions across all industries that
were closed after January 1, 2016 and before April 27, 2018. These transactions included public targets with 100% cash consideration and equity value
at announcement between $1.5 billion and $4.0 billion (referred to in this proxy statement as the “All Industries Precedent Transactions”). Sandler
O’Neill then compared the market premium in the proposed merger to the All Industries Precedent Transactions.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Sandler O’Neill performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per share of Financial Engines common stock utilizing internal
financial forecasts, including estimated adjusted EBITDA, for Financial Engines for the year ending December 31, 2018, as provided by the senior
management of Financial Engines, as well as estimated annual growth rates (described below) of pro forma adjusted EBITDA for Financial Engines for
the years thereafter, as discussed with the senior management of Financial Engines. Sandler O’Neill also utilized estimated cash flow from operating
activities less estimated cash used in investing activities for the year ending December 31, 2018, as provided by senior management of Financial
Engines. For the purposes of this analysis, Sandler O’Neill treated non-cash stock-based compensation as a cash expense of $40.0 million ($30.0 million
on an after-tax basis, assuming a 25% tax rate) and excluded $20.9 million in cash flow from deferred tax assets for the year ending December 31, 2018
(as it is non-recurring), as discussed with the senior management of Financial Engines. The resulting estimated pro forma cash flows and pro forma
adjusted EBITDA were grown from year-end 2018 to 2022 at compound annual growth rates ranging from 8.0% to 16.0%, as discussed with the senior
management of Financial Engines. Sandler O’Neill also applied a range of enterprise value / forward pro forma adjusted EBITDA exit multiples from
10.0x to 18.0x, taking into account the results of the comparable company analyses and the precedent merger transaction analyses and applying its
professional judgment and applied a discount rate of 13.1%, reflecting Sandler O’Neill’s estimate of Financial Engines’ weighted average cost of
capital. In its normal course of business, Sandler O’Neill employs the Duff & Phelps valuation handbook in determining an appropriate discount rate in
which the discount rate equals the 10-year U.S. Treasury Yield plus the product of Financial Engines’ 2-year beta and the equity risk premium.

Sandler O’Neill’s Relationship

Sandler O’Neill is acting as financial advisor to Financial Engines in connection with the merger. Financial Engines has agreed to pay Sandler
O’Neill a transaction fee in an amount equal to 0.75% of the aggregate merger consideration, which fee at the time of announcement was approximately
$22.6 million and is contingent upon the closing of the merger. Sandler O’Neill also received a fee in an amount equal to $1,000,000 upon Sandler
O’Neill rendering its fairness opinion, which opinion fee will be credited in full toward the transaction fee becoming payable to Sandler O’Neill upon
the closing of the merger. Financial Engines has also agreed to indemnify Sandler O’Neill against certain claims and liabilities arising out of its
engagement and to reimburse Sandler O’Neill for certain of its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the engagement.

Sandler O’Neill did not provide any other investment banking services to Financial Engines in the two years preceding the date of its opinion, nor
did Sandler O’Neill provide any investment banking services to entities affiliated with Parent or Flashdance Merger Sub, Inc. in the two years preceding
the date of its opinion. In the ordinary course of Sandler O’Neill’s business as a broker-dealer, Sandler O’Neill may purchase securities from and sell
securities to Financial Engines and its affiliates. Sandler O’Neill may also actively trade the equity and debt securities of Financial Engines for its own
account and for the accounts of its customers.

Limited Guarantees

Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, the guarantors entered into limited guarantees, pursuant to which they agreed to
guarantee, on the terms and conditions set forth in the limited guarantees, Parent’s obligation to pay any termination fee, reimburse and indemnify the
Company with respect to certain expenses in connection with the merger and pay certain other amounts.

Each of the limited guarantees will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (1) the consummation of the merger, (2) receipt in full in cash by the
Company of the payment obligations of Parent that is the subject of the limited guarantee, (3) the valid termination of the merger agreement in any
circumstance other than one in which Parent could be obligated to pay any of the obligations that is the subject of the limited guarantee, and (4) the date
that is the three-month anniversary of the date of the termination of the merger agreement in any circumstance in which Parent could be obligated to pay
any of the obligations that is the subject of the limited guarantee (unless a claim for payment of any of such obligations is presented by the Company to
Parent, Merger Sub or the guarantor on or prior to such three-month anniversary).

Financing

The equity financing sources have committed to capitalize Parent, on the date of the closing of the merger, with an aggregate equity subscription
of up to $1.45 billion, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the equity commitment letter.

In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Parent entered into the debt commitment letter, pursuant to which each of Morgan
Stanley, JPM, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS committed, upon certain terms and subject to certain conditions, to lend the borrower $1.905 billion in
the aggregate in connection with the financing of the amounts payable pursuant to the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and
the refinancing of certain debt by Parent and to make available to the borrower a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to

Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendations of the Financial Engines board of directors with respect to the merger, Financial Engines’ stockholders
should be aware that the directors and executive officers of Financial Engines have certain interests, including financial interests, in the merger that may
be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Financial Engines’ stockholders generally. The Financial Engines board of directors was aware of
these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement, and in making its recommendation that Financial
Engines’ stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are
quantified in the narrative and the tables below. The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be a “change in control,” “change of
control,” or term of similar meaning for purposes of the Company’s executive compensation and benefit plans and agreements described below.

Certain Assumptions

Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following
assumptions were used:
 

 •  The relevant price per share of the Company common stock is $45.00, which is the amount of the merger consideration;
 

 
•  The effective time is June 1, 2018, which is the assumed date of the closing of the merger solely for purposes of the disclosure in this

section;
 

 
•  Each executive officer of the Company experiences a qualifying termination, including a termination by the Company without “cause” or

resignation by the executive officer for “good reason,” as such terms are defined in the relevant Company plans and agreements,
immediately following the assumed effective time of June 1, 2018.

Equity Compensation

Treatment of Stock Options. Each Company stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is (x) outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the effective time and (y) granted prior to the date of the merger agreement shall, as of the effective time, become fully vested (to the extent unvested)
and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise
price per share of such option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company common stock subject to such Company stock option, subject to
applicable tax withholding. Any Company stock option that has an exercise price per share of Company common stock that is greater than or equal to
the merger consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.

Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Each Company restricted stock unit award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time shall, as of the effective time, (i) if granted prior to the date of the merger agreement or held by a non-employee director, become fully
vested and nonforfeitable, and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the merger
consideration in respect of each vested share of Company commons stock subject to such restricted stock unit award, subject to applicable tax
withholding, or (ii) if granted after the date of the merger agreement as permitted by the merger agreement (other than any such award granted to a
non-employee director), be converted into an award representing the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration in respect of

share of Company common stock subject to such Company restricted stock unit award (without interest and subject to applicable tax withholding) on the
same schedule, and subject to the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting), as were applicable to such Company restricted stock
unit award as of immediately prior to the effective time.

Quantification of Equity Compensation

See the section entitled “— Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Merger” for an estimate of the value of the unvested equity awards held by each of the Company’s named executive officers that will become vested at
the effective time. Based on the assumptions described above under “— Certain Assumptions,” (i) the estimated aggregate value of the unvested equity
awards held by the Company’s two executive officers who are not named executive officers that will become vested at the effective time is $2,752,308,
and (ii) the estimated aggregate value of the unvested equity awards held by the Company’s eight non-employee directors that will become vested at the
effective time is $3,903,457. The executive officers do not hold any restricted stock units or stock options that were granted on or after the date of the
merger agreement. For more information on equity holdings of the Company’s non-employee directors and named executive officers, see the table
entitled “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.”

Change in Control Employment Agreements

Change in Control Employment Agreements with Executive Officers

The Company has entered into a Severance and Change in Control Agreement (referred to in this proxy statement as a “CIC Agreement”) with six
executive officers, including each named executive officer other than Mr. Bunch, whose severance benefits are set forth in his employment agreement.

Under each CIC Agreement, upon a termination of the executive officer’s employment by the Company without cause, or due to the executive
officer’s resignation for good reason, in each case within two months prior to or 12 months following a change in control, the officer is entitled to
receive the following benefits, in addition to the acceleration of equity awards discussed above:
 

 

•  a lump sum cash severance payment equal to the sum of 12 times (18 times for Lawrence M. Raffone) the officer’s monthly base salary in
effect immediately prior to the officer’s termination of employment (or in the event of a resignation for good reason, immediately prior to
any reduction in base salary that serves as the basis for such resignation) and 100% of his or her target bonus in the year of termination
(150% for Mr. Raffone);

 

 •  12 months of Company-paid health benefits continuation from the termination date; and
 

 
•  career transition services provided by a third-party vendor selected by the Company, to be paid for by the Company for 12 months following

the date of termination.

The foregoing benefits are contingent upon the the executive officer executing and not revoking a release of claims against the Company and its
affiliates and adhering to certain restrictive covenants.

Each CIC Agreement provides that if the payments and benefits to the named executive officer in connection with a change in control would be
subject to an excise tax by reason of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, the payments and benefits under the CIC Agreement will be reduced to the
extent necessary to prevent any portion of the officer’s change in control-related payments and benefits from becoming subject to such excise tax, but
only if, by reason of that reduction, the net after-tax benefit received by the officer exceeds the net after-tax benefit that the officer would receive if no
reduction was made.

Bunch Employment Agreement

The Company has entered into an employment agreement with John Bunch. Pursuant to the agreement, upon termination of Mr. Bunch’s
employment by the Company without cause, or due to Mr. Bunch’s resignation for good reason, he is entitled to receive a severance payment equal to
50% of his annual base salary in effect at the time of termination, plus 50% of his prior year annual bonus. This severance payment is contingent on
Mr. Bunch entering into and not revoking a release of claims against the Company and its affiliates and adhering to certain restrictive covenants.

Quantification of Severance Payments

See the section entitled “— Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Merger” for an estimate of the value of the severance benefits payable to each of the Company’s named executive officers upon a qualifying termination
following the effective time. The estimated aggregate amount of the cash severance that would be payable to the Company’s two executive officers who
are not named executive officers upon a qualifying termination immediately after the effective time is $1,024,500.

Indemnification and Insurance

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Company directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification
and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies following the merger. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Indemnification and Insurance.”

Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger

The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of
information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of the Company that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger. The
amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date,
including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before
completion of the merger. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:
 

 •  the relevant price per share of the Company common stock is $45.00, which is the amount of the merger consideration;
 

 
•  the effective time is June 1, 2018, which is the assumed date of the closing of the merger solely for purposes of the disclosure in this section;

and
 

 
•  each named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination, including a termination by the Company without “cause” or resignation

by the named executive officer for “good reason,” as such terms are defined in the relevant Company plans and agreements, immediately
following the assumed effective time of June 1, 2018.

(1) Raymond J. Sims, who was a named executive officer of the Company in 2017, is no longer employed by the Company and holds no unvested
equity awards. Accordingly, he is not entitled to receive any compensatory payments in connection with the merger.

(2) Cash. A lump sum cash severance payment equal to the sum of (i) 12 times (18 times for Mr. Raffone) the officer’s monthly base salary in effect
immediately prior to the qualifying termination (or in the event of a resignation for good reason, immediately prior to any reduction in base salary
that serves as the basis for such resignation) (or 50% of base compensation in effect at the time of termination of employment in the case of
Mr. Bunch) and (ii) 100% of his or her target bonus in the year of termination (150% for the CEO, Mr. Raffone) (or 50% of prior year bonus in the
case of Mr. Bunch). Such payments are “double trigger” and payable only upon a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the
merger. The estimated amount of each such payment is shown in the following table:

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of common
stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as

statement as the “Code”), applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial opinions and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal
Revenue Service (referred to in this proxy statement as the “IRS”), each as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change or
differing interpretations, possibly with a retroactive basis, and any such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and
conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution
tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, nor does it address any tax considerations under state, local or foreign laws or
U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 

 •  a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
 

 
•  a corporation, or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of

the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
 

 
•  a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration, and one or more U.S.

persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) such trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or

 

 •  an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

This discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of common stock who hold such shares as a capital asset under the Code (generally,
property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a
U.S. holder in light of its particular circumstances, or that may apply to U.S. holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws
(including, for example, insurance companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect to apply the
mark-to-market method of accounting, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S.
dollar, tax-exempt organizations, tax-qualified retirement plans, banks and other financial institutions, mutual funds, certain former citizens or former
long-term residents of the United States, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or
other flow-through entities (and investors therein), S corporations, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, U.S. holders who hold
shares of common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction, a holder required to accelerate the
recognition of any item of gross income with respect to our common stock as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial
statement, and U.S. holders who acquired their shares of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation
arrangements). This discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of shares of common stock who exercise
appraisal rights in connection with the merger under the DGCL.

If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of
common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership.
If you are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a partner in a partnership holding shares of common stock, you should consult your tax advisor.

Holders of common stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them of the merger,
including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, the unearned income Medicare contribution tax and any other U.S.
federal, or state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.

holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares (which generally will equal the
price the U.S. holder paid for such shares).

Any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of common stock surrendered in the
merger is greater than one year as of the date of the merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, are
generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired
different blocks of common stock at different times and different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding
period separately with respect to each block of common stock.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Payments made in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject, under certain circumstances, to information
reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24% for payments made before January 1, 2026). To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder
that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return to the applicable withholding agent a properly completed and executed IRS
Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a U.S. person, that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct, and that such U.S. holder is not
subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a
holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.

Regulatory Approvals

Under the HSR Act and related rules and regulations, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until notifications have
been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division and the FTC and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied.
Completion of the merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. The Company and Parent filed
their respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC on May 4, 2018, and received early termination of the HSR
waiting period on May 16, 2018.

At any time before or after the expiration of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act, the Antitrust Division or the FTC may take action
under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, to rescind the merger or to conditionally permit completion of the
merger subject to regulatory conditions or other remedies. In addition, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take action
under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the
merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some
circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it
would not be successful.

The Company and Parent are each required to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to complete the merger, including
cooperating and doing all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain regulatory approvals. This includes, if required by regulatory authorities,
(1) agreeing to sell, divest or dispose of any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company, or their respective subsidiaries and (2) taking or agreeing to
take other actions that after the closing date limit Parent’s or its subsidiaries’ (including the surviving corporation’s) freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain, one or more businesses, product lines or assets of Parent’s or its subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation). However, the
Company will only be required to take or commit to take such actions if they are binding on the Company only if and when the closing

prior to the time the closing would have otherwise been required to occur, in which case the closing will not take place until the earlier of (i) a business
day during the marketing period specified by Parent on at least three business days’ written notice to Financial Engines and (ii) the first business day
following the final day of the marketing period (subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable law) of all of the
conditions set forth in the merger agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the closing) as of the date determined pursuant to this clause (i) or (ii)), or (2) at another date and time
mutually agreed upon in writing between Financial Engines and Parent. For purposes of the merger agreement, “business day” refers to any day except a

For purposes of the merger agreement, “marketing period” means the first period of 15 consecutive business days commencing after the date of
the merger agreement throughout which (1) Parent must have the required financial information (as defined below) (which must be the same information
throughout the period), (2) the conditions to Parent’s obligation to effect the merger (set forth in sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the merger agreement) must have

were to be scheduled for any time during such 15 consecutive business-day period, or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived, and (3) during
the last three business days of such 15 consecutive business-day period, the conditions relating to stockholder approval and the expiration or termination
of the waiting period applicable to the completion of the merger under the HSR Act must have been satisfied; provided, however, that (i) July 5, 2018
and July 6, 2018 will not constitute business days for purposes of the 15 consecutive business-day period (although such exclusions will not restart such
period), (ii) if such 15 consecutive business-day period has not been completed on or prior to August 17, 2018, then such period will be deemed to have
not commenced prior to September 4, 2018, and (iii) the marketing period will be deemed not to have commenced if, after the date of the merger
agreement and prior to the completion of such 15 consecutive business-day period, (A) the independent auditors of Financial Engines will have
withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any year-end audited financial statements of Financial Engines and its subsidiaries included in the required
financial information, in which case the marketing period will be deemed not to commence unless and until such independent auditors or another

conditions, and compliance with the terms of each other provision, of this definition (including the requirement that required financial information be
the same information throughout the period)) such 15 consecutive business-day period referred to above will be deemed to have commenced on the date
such notice is delivered to Parent unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes Financial Engines has not provided the required financial information
or that clauses (2) or (3) of this definition have not been satisfied and, within three business days after Financial Engines’ giving of such notice, gives a
written notice to Financial Engines to that effect (stating with specificity any elements of noncompliance and/or nonsatisfaction). Notwithstanding
anything in this definition to the contrary, the marketing period will end on any date earlier than the date indicated in the definition above if the debt
financing is consummated and the full proceeds thereof received on such earlier date.

For purposes of the merger agreement, “required financial information” means certain financial statements of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries required by the debt commitment letter.

Effect of the Merger on the Common Stock

At the effective time, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time (other than (1) shares
held by Financial Engines in treasury or by Parent or Merger Sub (referred to in this proxy statement as “cancelled shares”), (2) shares held by any
wholly owned subsidiary of Financial Engines or any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) (referred to in this proxy statement as
“converted shares”) and (3) shares held by stockholders of the Company who have not voted in favor of, or consented in writing to, the adoption of the
merger agreement and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect to their shares in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL (referred
to in this proxy statement as “dissenting shares,” and the shares referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3), “excluded shares”)) will automatically be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, upon surrender of certificates or book-entry shares. The merger consideration
will be $45.00 per share in cash, without interest and subject to required withholding taxes.

At the effective time, each of the cancelled shares will automatically be cancelled without payment of any consideration and will cease to exist. In
addition, at the effective time, each of the converted shares held by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) will
automatically be converted into shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving corporation, such that each such subsidiary’s
ownership percentage of the surviving corporation immediately after the effective time will equal its ownership percentage in Financial Engines
immediately prior to the effective time. As of the date hereof, there are not expected to be any converted shares.

At the effective time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time will be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving corporation.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards

Treatment of Stock Options. Each Company stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is (x) outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the effective time and (y) granted prior to the date of the merger agreement shall, as of the effective time, become fully vested (to the extent unvested)
and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise
price per share of such option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company common stock subject to such Company stock option, subject to
applicable tax withholding. Any Company stock option that has an exercise price per share of Company common stock that is greater than or equal to
the merger consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.

Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Each Company restricted stock unit award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time shall, as of the effective time, (i) if granted prior to the date of

the merger agreement or held by a non-employee director, become fully vested and nonforfeitable, and shall be cancelled and converted automatically
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the merger consideration in respect of each vested share of Company commons stock subject to such
restricted stock unit award, subject to applicable tax withholding, or (ii) if granted after the date of the merger agreement as permitted by the merger
agreement (other than any such award granted to a non-employee director), be converted into an award representing the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the merger consideration in respect of each share of Company common stock subject to such Company restricted stock unit award (without
interest and subject to applicable tax withholding) on the same schedule, and subject to the same terms and conditions (including with respect to
vesting), as were applicable to such Company restricted stock unit award as of immediately prior to the effective time.

Payment for Common Stock in the Merger

At or prior to the effective time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a paying agent in trust for the benefit of holders of shares cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration.

As soon as reasonably practicable (and no later than three business days) after the effective time, Parent will cause the paying agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the effective time represented outstanding shares of Company common
stock (other than excluded shares) (1) a letter of transmittal and (2) instructions for effecting the surrender of such certificates to the paying agent in
exchange for payment of the merger consideration (without interest and subject to required withholding taxes). Upon surrender to the paying agent of
certificates, together with the letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably
required, the holder of such certificates will be entitled to receive payment of the merger consideration which the holder is entitled to pursuant to the
merger agreement in respect of each share formerly represented by such certificate (without interest and after giving effect to any required tax
withholding).

No holder of book-entry shares of Company common stock will be required to deliver a certificate or letter of transmittal to the paying agent to
receive the merger consideration in the merger (without interest and subject to required withholding taxes). In lieu thereof, the registered holder of each
book-entry share of Company common stock will automatically upon the effective time be entitled to receive, and, upon receipt by the paying agent of
an “agent’s message” in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the paying agent may reasonably request), Parent will or will cause the
surviving corporation to cause the paying agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, the
merger consideration (without interest and after giving effect to any required tax withholding).

Representations and Warranties

The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of Financial Engines, subject to certain exceptions in the merger agreement, in the
company disclosure schedule delivered in connection with the merger agreement and in Financial Engines’ public filings, as to, among other things:

 •  the absence of beneficial ownership of Company shares by Parent and its subsidiaries;

Some of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by materiality qualifications or a “company material adverse
effect” or “parent material adverse effect” qualification, as discussed below.

For purposes of the merger agreement, a “company material adverse effect” means any fact, circumstance, change, event, occurrence or effect that
(1) has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business or
results of operations of Financial Engines and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) materially impairs, materially delays or prevents, or would
reasonably be expected to materially impair, materially delay or prevent, Financial Engines from completing the merger. However, for the purposes of
clause (1), none of the following, and no effect arising out of, relating to or resulting from the following, will constitute or be taken into account in
determining whether a company material adverse effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur:
 

 
•  any facts, circumstances, changes, events, occurrences or effects generally affecting (a) the industries in which Financial Engines and its

subsidiaries operate or (b) the economy, credit, debt, securities or financial or capital markets in the United States or elsewhere in the world,
including changes in interest or exchange rates or deterioration of the credit markets generally;

 

 

•  any facts, circumstances, changes, events, occurrences or effects, to the extent arising out of, resulting from or attributable to (a) changes or
prospective changes in law, in GAAP or other accounting standards, or any changes or prospective changes in the interpretation or
enforcement of any of the foregoing, (b) entry into, consummation and performance of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and the public announcement thereof, including the impact thereof on relationships with customers, suppliers,
distributors, partners, employees, regulators or third parties (except with respect to Financial Engines’ representations and warranties and the
related closing condition relating to consents and approvals relating to the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and
the absence of certain violations), (c) acts of war (whether or not declared) or any outbreaks of hostilities, sabotage or terrorism, or
escalations or worsening thereof, (d) weather, pandemics, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, natural disasters, climatic conditions or other
force majeure events, whether or not weather-related, (e) regulatory and political conditions or developments, (f) any change resulting or
arising from the identity of, or any facts or circumstances relating to, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates, (g) any legal
proceedings made or brought by any current or former stockholders of Financial Engines (on their own behalf or on behalf of Financial
Engines), but in any event only in their capacities as current or former stockholders, or otherwise under the DGCL or other applicable law,
or other litigation (except, solely with respect to such other litigation, with respect to Financial Engines’ representations and warranties and
the related losing condition relating to consents and approvals relating to the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement
and the absence of certain violations), arising out of or related to the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, (h) actions
or omissions of Financial Engines or any of its subsidiaries requested or consented to in writing by Parent or expressly required by the
merger agreement, (i) any decline in the market price, or change in trading volume of the common stock of Financial Engines (or the
volatility thereof) or (j) any failure to meet any internal or public projections, forecasts or estimates of revenue, earnings, cash flow or cash
position or other metrics; or

However, with respect to the matters described in the first bullet point above and in clauses (a), (c), (d) and (e) of the second bullet point above,
such facts, circumstances, changes, events occurrences or effects may be taken into account to the extent that they have a disproportionate adverse effect
on Financial Engines and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in relation to others in the industries of Financial Engines and its subsidiaries, but only to the
extent of the incremental disproportionate impact on Financial Engines and its subsidiaries. In addition, the underlying cause of any decline, change or
failure referred to in clauses (i) and (j) of the second bullet point above may be taken into account unless the underlying clause is otherwise excluded by
the merger agreement. For purposes of the merger agreement, a “parent material adverse effect” means any fact, circumstance, change, event occurrence
or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, materially impairs, materially delays or prevents, or would reasonably be expected to materially impair,
materially delay or prevent, Parent or Merger Sub from completing the merger.

Conduct of Business Pending the Merger

The merger agreement provides that, from and after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the effective time or termination of the merger
agreement, except with Parent’s prior written consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), as required by applicable law,
as expressly contemplated by the merger agreement or as set forth in the disclosure schedules to the merger agreement, Financial Engines will, and will
cause its subsidiaries to, carry on its business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business and use commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve its business organization intact and maintain existing relations with key customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom Financial
Engines and its subsidiaries have significant business relationships, and will not and will cause its subsidiaries not to, take any of the following actions:
 

 

•  declare, set aside or pay any dividends on, or make any other distributions in respect of, any of its capital stock or equity interests, except for
regular quarterly cash dividends of up to $0.08 per share with a declaration date, record date and payment date each being consistent with
the Company’s past quarterly dividend practice and dividends or distributions by a subsidiary of the Company to the Company or to another
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company;

 

 
•  other than in the case of wholly owned subsidiaries, split, combine, subdivide, adjust amend the terms of or reclassify any of its capital stock

or equity interests;
 

 

•  issue, deliver, sell, pledge, grant, transfer or otherwise encumber any shares of its capital stock or other equity securities or any option,
warrant or other right to acquire or receive shares of its capital stock or other equity securities, or redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any
shares of its capital stock or other equity securities, other than (1) in connection with the exercise, vesting or settlement, as applicable, of
Company equity awards outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement or granted in accordance with the merger agreement, including
with respect to the satisfaction of tax withholding and, with respect to Company stock options outstanding as of the date of the merger
agreement or granted in accordance with the merger agreement, the payment of the exercise price, (2) the issuance of any shares of capital
stock or equity interests to the Company or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries and (3) the grant of any liens to secure obligations of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries in respect of any indebtedness permitted under the eighth bullet point in this section;

 

 
•  amend the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or amend other similar organizational documents of any subsidiary of the

Company, except, in the case of subsidiaries, for amendments that would not be materially adverse to the Company or adversely impact the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

 

 
•  other than (1) acquisitions of inventory, raw materials and other property in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,

(2) pursuant to transactions that would be permissible under the seventh bullet point in this section or (3) in transactions among wholly

governmental entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or from any person alleging that such person’s consent is

would reasonably be expected to be material to Financial Engines, the surviving corporation or Parent, (2) of any actions commenced against such
Financial Engines, Parent or any of their affiliates in connection with, arising from or relating to the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement or (3) if Financial Engines or Parent becomes aware of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the merger or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement not to be
satisfied.

Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation

Except as permitted by the merger agreement, the Company must not, and must cause its subsidiaries, and must use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their directors, officers, employees, other affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives not to,
directly or indirectly:
 

 
•  initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries, discussions or requests with respect to or the making of any

proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal (as defined below) (referred to in this
proxy statement as an “inquiry”);

 

 
•  engage in or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an acquisition proposal or inquiry or that would reasonably

the transaction;

•  the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, of over 20% of the fair market value of the consolidated assets of Financial Engines and

its subsidiaries, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Existing Discussions or Negotiations

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Financial Engines has agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries and its and its subsidiaries’ directors, officers and
employees to, and to instruct its affiliates and other representatives to, (1) immediately cease all solicitations, discussions and negotiations with any
other persons that were ongoing with respect to an acquisition proposal as of the date of the merger agreement and request that each such person
promptly return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such person by or on behalf of Financial Engines in connection with any acquisition
proposal and (2) not terminate, amend, release or modify any provision of any standstill agreement to which Financial Engines or any of its subsidiaries
is a party, except that Financial Engines may grant a limited waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or standstill agreement to the extent
necessary to allow for a confidential acquisition proposal to be made to Financial Engines or Financial Engines’ board of directors as long as Financial
Engines promptly (and in any event within 24 hours thereafter) notifies Parent thereof (including the identity of such counterparty (except to the extent
prohibited by any contract in effect as of the date of the merger agreement)) after granting such limited waiver, amendment or release as provided below.

Receipt of Acquisition Proposals

Notwithstanding certain provisions of the merger agreement described above, at any time following the date of the merger agreement and prior to
the time the company stockholder approval is obtained, if Financial Engines receives a written, unsolicited, bona fide acquisition proposal that did not
result from a breach of the provisions of the merger agreement described above, then Financial Engines and its representatives may contact the person or
group of persons making the acquisition proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether it constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal (as defined below) and, if the Financial Engines board of directors determines in good faith after
consultation (1) with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that the acquisition proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result
in, a superior proposal and (2) with its outside legal counsel that failure to take the actions described below would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law, then Financial Engines and its representatives may:
 

 

•  provide information to such person or group of persons (including their respective representatives and prospective equity and debt financing
sources) if the Company receives from such person or group of persons (or has received from such person or group of persons an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms not materially less favorable to Financial Engines than those contained in the confidentiality
agreement to which Parent is subject, except that it need not contain any standstill or similar provision, provided that Financial Engines must
substantially concurrently (and in any event, within 24 hours) make available to Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information
concerning Financial Engines or its subsidiaries that is provided to any such person or group of persons and that was not previously made
available to Parent or Merger Sub; and

 

 •  engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with that person or group of persons.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, a “superior proposal” means a bona fide written acquisition proposal that the Financial Engines board of
directors has determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and taking into consideration,
among other things, all legal, financial,

regulatory, timing and other aspects and risks of the proposal (including required conditions) and the person making the proposal and all of the other
terms, conditions and other aspects of such acquisition proposal and the merger agreement that the Financial Engines board of directors deems relevant,
to be more favorable to Financial Engines’ stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
(including, if applicable, any revisions to the merger agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent pursuant to the merger agreement); provided, that
for purposes of the definition of “superior proposal,” the references to “20%” and “80%” in the definition of acquisition proposal will be deemed to be
references to “50%.”

Change in Board Recommendation

The Financial Engines board of directors has unanimously recommended that Financial Engines stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

Except as expressly permitted by the merger agreement, neither the Financial Engines board of directors (nor any committee thereof) may:
 

 
•  withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in each case in a manner adverse to

Parent, the recommendation of the Financial Engines board of directors that the Company’s stockholders adopt the merger agreement
(referred to in this proxy statement as the “company recommendation”);

 

 •  fail to include the company recommendation in this proxy statement;
 

 
•  adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any acquisition

proposal;
 

 

•  fail to publicly reaffirm the company recommendation within 10 business days of the public disclosure of an acquisition proposal (other than
of the type referred to in the following bullet point) with any person other than Parent or Merger Sub (provided that if the stockholders
meeting is scheduled to be held within 10 business days of such public disclosure, promptly and in any event prior to two business days
before the date the stockholders meeting is scheduled to be held); or

 

 

•  fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 under the Exchange Act, against any acquisition
proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D promulgated under the Exchange Act within 10 business days
after the commencement of the tender offer or exchange offer (or, if the stockholders meeting is scheduled to be held within 10 business
days from the date of the commencement, promptly and in any event prior to two business days before the date the stockholders meeting is
scheduled to be held).

The actions described in the bullet points above are referred to in this proxy statement as a “change of recommendation,” except that any
“stop-look-and-listen” or similar communication described below or the failure by the Financial Engines board of directors to take a position with
respect to an acquisition proposal referred to in the fourth bullet point above or a tender offer or exchange offer referred to in the fifth bullet point above
will not be deemed a change of recommendation if the communication is made or the position is taken prior to the tenth business day after the
commencement of the tender offer or exchange offer or the public disclosure of the acquisition proposal, as applicable (or such earlier time as referenced
above).

However, before the company stockholder approval is obtained, the Financial Engines board of directors may (1) make a change of
recommendation contemplated by the first and second bullet points above if, upon the occurrence of an intervening event (as defined below), the
Financial Engines board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law or (2) if the Company receives after the date of the merger
agreement an unsolicited, written, bona fide acquisition proposal that the Financial Engines board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel,

agreement described under the section of this proxy statement entitled “— Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation,” effect a change of recommendation
and/or terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement providing for such superior proposal, provided that in
either case:
 

 

•  Financial Engines must have given Parent at least three business days’ prior written notice that it intends to make a change of
recommendation (referred to in this proxy statement as a “notice of change of recommendation”) and/or terminate the merger agreement,
which notice must specify in reasonable detail the basis for the change of recommendation and/or termination and, in the case of a superior
proposal, the identity of the person or group of persons making the superior proposal and the material terms thereof along with a copy of any
proposed agreement in respect of such superior proposal or, in the case of an intervening event, reasonable detail regarding the intervening
event;

 

 

•  after providing such notice and prior to making a change of recommendation and/or terminating the merger agreement, Financial Engines
must have negotiated, and shall have caused its representatives to be available to negotiate, in good faith with Parent and Merger Sub (to the
extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) during the three-business day notice period to make adjustments to the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement as would obviate the need for the Company to effect a change of recommendation and/or terminate the
merger agreement; and

 

 

•  at the end of the three-business day notice period, the Financial Engines board of directors must have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and, with respect to a superior proposal giving rise to the notice of change of recommendation, its
financial advisor, taking into account any changes to the merger agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to the notice of change
of recommendation, that (1) the superior proposal giving rise to the notice of change of recommendation continues to be a superior proposal
or (2) in the case of an intervening event, the failure of the Financial Engines board of directors to make a change of recommendation would
continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law.

Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material change to the terms of a superior proposal requires Financial Engines to deliver a new
notice of change of recommendation and to comply with the requirements in the bullets above, provided that the subsequent notice period will only be
two business days instead of three business days.

Under the merger agreement, an “intervening event” means a material event, occurrence, development or change in circumstances with respect to
Financial Engines and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that occurred or arose after the date of the merger agreement, which was unknown to, nor
reasonably foreseeable by, the Financial Engines board of directors as of the date of the merger agreement and becomes known to or by the Financial
Engines board of directors before the time stockholder approval is obtained, provided that the following do not constitute, and will not be considered in
determining whether there has been, an intervening event: (1) the receipt, existence of or terms of an inquiry or acquisition proposal or any matter
relating thereto or consequence thereof and (2) changes in the market price or trading volume of the shares of Financial Engines or the fact that
Financial Engines meets or exceeds internal or published projections, budgets, forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings or other financial results for
any period (provided that the underlying causes of such change or fact will not be excluded by clause (2)).

The merger agreement does not prohibit Financial Engines or the Financial Engines board of directors (or any committee thereof) from
(1) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable law or the NASDAQ, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders) or (2) making any “stop-look-
and-listen” communication to stockholders of Financial Engines pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to

proposal that is not a tender offer or exchange offer), provided that (i) except as provided in the next sentence, any disclosure made as permitted under
clause (1) (other than any “stop-look-and-listen” or similar communication) that relates to an acquisition proposal will be deemed a change of
recommendation unless the Financial Engines board of directors expressly publicly reaffirms the company recommendation in connection with such
disclosure and (ii) neither Financial Engines nor the Financial Engines board of directors (nor any committee thereof) will be permitted to recommend
any acquisition proposal (including that the Financial Engines stockholders tender any securities in connection with any tender offer or exchange offer
that is an acquisition proposal) or otherwise make a change of recommendation with respect thereto, except as permitted as described above. Any
“stop-look-and-listen” or similar communication permitted under clause (2) above made prior to the tenth business day after the commencement of such
tender offer or exchange offer (or, if earlier, no fewer than two business days prior to the date on which the stockholders meeting is scheduled to be held)
will not constitute a change of recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for Parent to terminate the merger agreement.

Financial Engines must promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if any acquisition proposal or inquiry
(including any request for non-public information in connection therewith) is received by Financial Engines, any of its subsidiaries or any of its
representatives, indicating (except to the extent prohibited by any applicable law or contract in effect as of the date of the merger agreement) the identity
of the person or group of persons making the acquisition proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of any such acquisition
proposal (including, if applicable, copies of any written inquiries and any proposed agreements related thereto). Financial Engines must (1) promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing (a) if Financial Engines determines to begin providing non-public information or
to engage in negotiations or discussions concerning an acquisition proposal and (b) thereafter of any change to the financial and other material terms and
conditions of any acquisition proposal, and (2) otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material terms of any such inquiry,
acquisition proposal, discussions or negotiations on a reasonably current basis, including by providing a copy of all proposals, offers or drafts of
proposed agreements. Financial Engines and its subsidiaries may not enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit them from
providing such information to Parent.

Financial Engines Stockholders’ Meeting

Financial Engines has agreed to take all action necessary to convene a meeting of the holders of Financial Engines common stock (which meeting,
together with any adjournment or postponement, is referred to in this proxy statement as the “Financial Engines stockholders’ meeting”) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on this proxy statement, to consider and vote upon the adoption of the
merger agreement; provided that Financial Engines may postpone or adjourn the Financial Engines stockholders’ meeting with Parent’s written consent
(which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), for the absence of a quorum, to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional
proxies if the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of common stock to adopt the merger agreement, whether or
not a quorum is present, if required by applicable law, or to allow reasonable time additional for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or
amended disclosure if, in the good faith judgment of the Financial Engines board of directors (after consultation with outside legal counsel), the failure
to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law. However, unless agreed by Parent, the
Financial Engines stockholders’ meeting will not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than five business days prior to the termination date
(as defined below).

Subject to the Financial Engines board of directors’ right to make a change of recommendation, as described in the section of this proxy statement
entitled “— Change in Board Recommendation,” the Financial Engines board of directors must include the company recommendation in this proxy
statement and must use its reasonable best efforts to lawfully obtain the company stockholder approval, including actively soliciting proxies in favor of
the adoption of the merger agreement at the Financial Engines stockholders’ meeting.

Table of Contents

In the event that the Financial Engines board of directors makes a change of recommendation, Financial Engines will be required to submit the
merger agreement to holders of Financial Engines common stock to obtain the company stockholder approval at the Financial Engines stockholders’
meeting unless the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. In addition, Financial Engines is not permitted to submit to the vote of
its stockholders any other acquisition proposal unless the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

Financing and Financing Cooperation

Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Parent delivered to Financial Engines (1) a copy of the fully executed debt commitment
letter, pursuant to which each of Morgan Stanley, JPM, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS have committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, to lend the borrower $1.410 billion in aggregate principal amount of first lien term loans and $495 million in aggregate principal
amount of second lien term loans in connection with the financing of the amounts payable pursuant to the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and the refinancing of certain debt by Parent and to make available to such borrower a revolving credit facility in an aggregate
principal amount of up to $150 million (such financing, collectively, is referred to in this proxy statement as the “debt financing”) and (2) a redacted
copy of the related fee letter.

Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to use reasonable best efforts to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the debt financing and any replacement financing on the terms
and conditions described in the debt commitment letter or replacement financing documents, as applicable, as promptly as possible, taking into account
the expected timing of the marketing period but in any event prior to the date upon which the merger is required to be completed pursuant to the terms of
the merger agreement. Financial Engines is required to use reasonable best efforts to, and to cause its subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to,
and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries’ representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent
necessary and customary for the arrangement of the debt financing, subject to certain limitations.

Employee Matters

During the period commencing on the closing date and ending on the first anniversary thereof, Parent has agreed to, or cause its applicable
subsidiary to, provide each continuing employee of the Company and its subsidiaries with (i) a base salary or regular hourly wage (whichever is
applicable) and a short-term cash incentive compensation opportunity, that, in each case, is not less than the base salary or regular hourly wage and
short-term cash incentive compensation opportunity in effect for, or available to, the applicable continuing employee as of immediately prior to the
effective time, and (ii) other compensation opportunities (excluding any equity award or other long-term compensation opportunities) and employee
benefits (excluding any severance-related benefits) that are, in each case, substantially similar in the aggregate to the other compensation (excluding any
equity award or other long-term compensation opportunities) and employee benefits (excluding any severance-related benefits), respectively, provided
or available to the applicable continuing employee as of immediately prior to the effective time.

During the period commencing on the closing date and ending on the first anniversary thereof, the surviving corporation shall provide each
continuing employee whose employment is terminated by Parent or one of its subsidiaries with severance benefits and on terms and conditions, in each
case, that are no less favorable than the severance benefits and protections provided to each such continuing employee as of immediately prior to the
effective time as set forth in the disclosure schedules to the merger agreement (or, if greater, those applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent
and its subsidiaries pursuant to any broad-based severance program).

Parent has agreed to cause any employee benefit plans of Parent and its subsidiaries in which the continuing employees are entitled to participate
after the closing date to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting

and benefit accruals (other than benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or as would result in a duplication of benefits), service prior to
the effective time by such employees to the Company and its subsidiaries (and any predecessors) as if such service were with Parent or its subsidiaries.

In addition, with respect to any employee benefit plans maintained by Parent and its subsidiaries for the benefit of the continuing employees
following the closing date Parent has agreed to, and cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to, (i) waive any eligibility requirements or
pre-existing condition limitations or waiting period requirements with respect to any such plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision
benefits to any continuing employee to the same extent waived under the analogous Company benefit plan prior to the closing date, and (ii) give effect,
in determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to any eligible expenses paid by such employees during the
calendar year in which the effective time occurs (or such later date on which a continuing employee commences participation in any new plan of the
surviving corporation and its subsidiaries) under analogous Company benefit plans.

Parent has agreed to pay, or cause its applicable subsidiary to pay, to each continuing employee who remains employed through December 31,
2018 (whether or not employed on the payment date), an annual incentive bonus in respect of 2018, payable no later than March 15, 2019, equal to the
bonus that such employee would have earned based upon actual performance through December 31, 2018. For such purpose, actual performance shall
be determined in a manner that is consistent with the Company’s past practice and shall exclude any costs and expenses associated with the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement or any nonrecurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred by the Company and
its subsidiaries had the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement not occurred. Each continuing employee whose employment is terminated on

number of days from January 1, 2018 through the date of such continuing employee’s termination of employment and the denominator of which is 365.

Efforts to Complete the Merger

The Company, Parent and Merger have agreed to, and to cause their respective subsidiaries to, each use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other in doing (and, in the case of Parent, to
use reasonable best efforts to cause its equity financing sources for the merger and their affiliates to assist and cooperate as necessary or appropriate with
the other parties), all things necessary, proper or advisable under the merger agreement or applicable law or otherwise complete and make effective the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as soon as practicable, including to (1) obtain from any governmental entities and any third parties

or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby and

Company and its subsidiaries will not be required to pay prior to the effective time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party to obtain
consent or approval required for the completion of the merger under any contract. Further, without Parent’s prior written consent, neither the Company
nor its subsidiaries may pay or commit to pay any third party whose consent or approval is being solicited any amount of cash or other consideration, or
make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation in connection therewith, in each case other than fees for the filings described in clause
(2) above and certain other agreed costs.

communication to that party from any governmental entity with respect to the merger agreement and the transactions and other agreements contemplated
by the merger agreement and permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed material communication to any governmental entity, (2) unless
required by applicable law, not agree to participate in any meeting or teleconference with any governmental entity in respect of any filing, investigation

parties may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of necessary filings, registrations or submissions of information to any governmental

competitively sensitive material as “outside counsel only material.” Materials provided to the other party or its counsel pursuant to the foregoing may be
redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, privileged communications or other competitively sensitive material.

The Company has agreed, to the extent required by applicable law or contract, within 20 business days after the date of the merger agreement, to

order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits completion of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, including by pursuing all reasonable avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub
must, and the Company and Parent must cause their respective subsidiaries to, (1) negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, or of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, and (2) otherwise take or commit to take any actions that after the closing date limit Parent’s or its subsidiaries’ (including the surviving
corporation’s) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or any of its subsidiaries
(including the surviving corporation), in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any order which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing the closing, materially delaying the closing or delaying the closing beyond the termination date. However,
the Company will only be required to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, if such action, commitment,
agreement, condition or restriction is binding on the Company only if and when the closing occurs.

Indemnification and Insurance

Parent and the surviving corporation must, jointly and severally, (1) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law, each present and former director and officer of Financial Engines and its subsidiaries and each fiduciary of a company benefit plan (collectively
referred to in this proxy statement, together with such person’s heirs, executors or administrators, as the “indemnified parties”), against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, related to or in connection with
any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether prior to or at the effective time (including in connection with such indemnified
parties’ service as a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or a fiduciary of a company benefit plan or services performed by such
persons at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or its subsidiaries), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time,
including, in connection with (1) the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (2) actions to enforce the provision of the merger
agreement described here or any other indemnification, exculpation or advancement right of any indemnified party. For a period of six years from and
after the effective time, Parent is required, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, to cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
surviving corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the indemnified parties with respect to indemnification, exculpation from liabilities and
rights to advancement of expenses than those set forth as of the date of the merger agreement in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Financial
Engines, and not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify those provisions in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of any indemnified party. In
addition, from and after the effective time, each of Parent and the surviving corporation must advance costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) as
incurred by any indemnified party promptly (and in any event within 10 days) after receipt by Parent of a written request for such advance to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay the advances if it is
ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

In addition, prior to the effective time, Financial Engines must obtain and fully pre-pay the premium for (and, following the effective time, the
surviving corporation must, and Parent must cause the surviving corporation to, maintain with reputable and financially sound carriers) the extension of
(1) the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of Financial Engines’ existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and (2) Financial Engines’
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (referred to in this proxy statement as “D&O insurance”), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery
period (whichever is greater) of six years from and after the effective time with respect to any claim arising from facts or events that existed or occurred
at or prior to the effective time with terms, conditions, retentions, coverage limits and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage
provided under Financial Engines’ existing policies in effect on the date of the merger agreement, or the surviving corporation will, and Parent will
cause the surviving corporation to, maintain the

D&O insurance for such six-year period or purchase comparable insurance as the D&O insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided under Financial Engines’ existing policies as of the date of the
merger agreement. In no event will Financial Engines or the surviving corporation be required to expend for any such policies pursuant to the foregoing
an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the current aggregate annual premium paid by Financial Engines for such insurance and, if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceeds such maximum amount, Financial Engines or the surviving corporation will obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for such maximum amount.

Coordination on Transaction Litigation

Financial Engines, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed, subject to the preservation of attorney-client or other applicable privilege, trade secret
protection and the provisions of the merger agreement governing the use and disclosure of confidential information, to keep the other party reasonably
informed on a current basis with respect to any actions commenced against it or any of its affiliates arising from or relating to the merger agreement or
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (referred to in this proxy statement as “transaction litigation”), to reasonably consult with the
other party and give consideration to the other’s advice regarding transaction litigation, and to give the other party the opportunity to participate in the
defense, settlement or prosecution of any transaction litigation, provided that the Company will in any event control any such defense, settlement or
prosecution. Financial Engines, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed not to settle any transaction litigation without the written consent of the other party
(which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Other Covenants and Agreements

The merger agreement also contains additional covenants, including covenants relating to (1) the filing of this proxy statement, (2) public
announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (3) other actions related to takeover statutes and reporting
requirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act and (4) the conduct prior to the effective time of Parent and Merger Sub.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger

Each party’s obligation to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver at or prior to the effective time of the following conditions:
 

 •  the adoption of the merger agreement by a majority of the outstanding shares of Financial Engines common stock entitled to vote thereon;
 

 •  the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the completion of the merger under the HSR Act; and
 

 
•  no law or order having been enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered by a court or other governmental entity of competent

jurisdiction that is in effect and that restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the completion of the merger.

The respective obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent at or prior to the
effective time of the following additional conditions:
 

 
•  the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company as of the closing date (except for any representations and warranties

made as of a particular date, which representations and warranties must be true and correct only as of that date), generally subject to a
“company material adverse effect” or other qualification provided in the merger agreement;

 

 
•  the performance by the Company in all material respects of the agreements and covenants required to be performed or complied with by it

under the merger agreement at or prior to the effective time;

 •  the absence of a company material adverse effect occurring after the date of the merger agreement; and
 

 
•  the receipt by Parent of a certificate signed by an executive officer of the Company, dated the closing date, to the effect that the conditions

set forth in the three preceding bullet points have been satisfied.

The obligation of the Company to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the Company at or prior to the effective time of
the following additional conditions:
 

 
•  the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub as of the closing date (except for any representations and

warranties made as of a particular date, which representations and warranties must be true and correct only as of that date), generally subject
to a “parent material adverse effect” or other qualification provided in the merger agreement;

 

 
•  the performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub in all material respects of the agreements and covenants required to be performed or

complied with by it under the merger agreement at or prior to the effective time; and
 

 
•  the receipt by the Company of a certificate signed by an executive officer of Parent, dated the closing date, to the effect that the conditions

set forth in the two preceding bullet points have been satisfied.

No party may rely, either as a basis for not completing the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or
terminating the merger agreement and abandoning the merger, on the failure of a condition to closing set forth in the merger agreement to be satisfied if
such failure was caused by such party’s failure to act in good faith or to use the efforts to cause the closing to occur as required by the merger agreement.

Termination

The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned in the following circumstances:
 

 •  at any time prior to the effective time by the mutual written consent of Financial Engines and Parent;
 

 •  at any time prior to the effective time by either Financial Engines or Parent:
 

 

•  if the merger has not been completed on or before October 29, 2018 (referred to in this proxy statement as the “termination date”);
provided that the right to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the termination provision referred to in this bullet point will not
be available to a party if the failure of the merger to have been completed on or before the termination date was primarily caused by
the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under the merger agreement; or

 

 
•  if the Financial Engines stockholders’ meeting has been duly held and completed and the company stockholder approval has not

been obtained at the Financial Engines stockholders’ meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the
adoption of the merger agreement is taken; or

prohibiting the completion of the merger has become final and nonappealable; provided that the right to terminate the merger
agreement pursuant to the termination provision referred to in this bullet point will not be available to a party if the enactment,
issuance, promulgation, enforcement or entry of such order, or the order becoming final and nonappealable, was primarily caused by
the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under the merger agreement;

Company Termination Fee

Financial Engines will pay Parent the company termination fee in an amount equal to $89 million in the following circumstances:
 

 •  if all three of the following conditions are satisfied:

(1) the merger agreement is terminated by (i) either Financial Engines or Parent because the merger has not been completed on or before the
termination date or because the company stockholder approval has not been obtained or (ii) Parent as a result of a breach by Financial
Engines of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement, which breach (x) gives rise to the failure of a
condition to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to complete the merger related to Financial Engines’ representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in the merger agreement and (y) is either not capable of being cured before the termination date or is not cured
before the earlier of 30 business days following receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach or the termination date, and in each case
at the time of the termination, the company stockholder approval has not been obtained, and

(2) any person has publicly proposed, announced or made an acquisition proposal (or in the case of clause (1)(ii), an acquisition proposal
has been made to Financial Engines’ management or the Financial Engines board of directors (or any committee thereof)) after the date of
the merger agreement and prior to the Financial Engines stockholders’ meeting and has not been withdrawn at least two business days prior
to the Financial Engines stockholders’ meeting (and in the case of clause (1)(ii), prior to the breach that forms the basis of the termination),
and

(3) within 12 months after the termination, Financial Engines completes an acquisition proposal or enters into a definitive agreement for an
acquisition proposal that is subsequently completed (even if after such 12-month period)

(provided that, for purposes of the provision referred to in this bullet point, the references to “20%” and “80%” in the definition of
“acquisition proposal” are deemed to be references to “50%”);

 

 
•  if the merger agreement is terminated by Financial Engines at any time prior to the time the company stockholder approval is obtained, in

order to substantially concurrently enter into an alternative acquisition agreement providing for a superior proposal; or
 

 
•  if the merger agreement is terminated by Parent because the Financial Engines board of directors (or any committee thereof) has made a

change of recommendation or allowed Financial Engines or any of its subsidiaries to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement (other
than an acceptable confidentiality agreement).

In no event will Financial Engines be required to pay the company termination fee on more than one occasion or be subject to monetary damages
for a willful and material breach by Financial Engines of its obligations under the merger agreement in an amount in excess of $181 million (referred to
in this proxy statement as the “company damage cap”) in the aggregate (including any payment of the company termination fee). In addition, in no event
will Parent and Merger Sub be entitled to (1) payment of monetary damages prior to the termination of the merger agreement or in amounts in excess of
the company damage cap, (2) payment of both monetary damages and the company termination fee in a combined amount in excess of the company
damages cap or (3) both (a) payment of any monetary damages and/or the company termination fee and (b) a grant of specific performance of the

the failure of such condition to be satisfied is primarily caused by a material breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their respective covenants or

In no event will Parent be obligated to pay the parent termination fee on more than one occasion or be subject to monetary damages for a willful
and material breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations under the merger agreement in an amount in excess of the parent termination fee in the
aggregate. In addition, in no event will Financial Engines be entitled to (1) payment of monetary damages prior to the termination of the merger

Limitation on Remedies

In the event of the termination of the merger agreement and the abandonment of the merger in accordance with the provisions described in the
section of this proxy statement entitled “— Termination,” the merger agreement will become void and of no effect with no liability to any person on the
part of Financial Engines, Parent or Merger Sub or their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees or stockholders, except that no such
termination shall relieve (1) Financial Engines of any liability to pay the company termination fee or Parent of any liability to pay the parent termination
fee, in each case to the extent required pursuant to the merger agreement, or (2) Financial Engines, Parent or Merger Sub of any liability for any willful
and material breach of the merger agreement prior to such termination, subject to the other limitations set forth in the merger agreement. In addition,
certain sections of the merger agreement, including among others sections relating to termination, termination fees and expenses, will survive
termination.

Expenses

Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement or each limited guarantee, whether or not the merger is completed, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring such
expense, except that all filing fees under the HSR Act in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be borne by

the amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment or modification, by Parent, Merger Sub and Financial
Engines, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective, except that (1) after receipt of the company stockholder
approval, no amendment may be made which by applicable law requires further approval by the holders of Financial Engines common stock without

Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement

Under the merger agreement, each of the parties has agreed that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or
relating to the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or, if that court lacks or declines to accept jurisdiction, another federal or state court located in the State of Delaware. However, each of the
parties has agreed that it will not bring or support any action or claim against the lenders party to the debt commitment letter or their representatives
arising out of or relating to the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in any forum other than any state or
federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York.

Each of the parties has agreed that if for any reason any of the provisions of the merger agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached or threatened to be breached, irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, in addition to any other available remedies a party may have in equity or at law, each party will be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of the merger agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Financial Engines will be entitled to specific
performance of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations pursuant to the merger agreement and the equity commitment letter to complete the merger only if
all of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to effect the merger (set forth in sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the merger agreement) have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, provided that those conditions would be satisfied if the
closing were on such date), Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the closing by the date the closing is required to have occurred pursuant to the
merger agreement, Parent’s debt financing has been funded or will be funded at the closing if Parent’s equity financing is funded at the closing, and the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that the closing will occur if Parent’s equity financing and debt financing are funded
and specific performance is granted; and (ii) Financial Engines will be entitled to specific performance requiring Parent and Merger Sub to enforce the
terms of the debt commitment letter and the obligations of the lenders to fund the debt financing only if all of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to
effect the merger (set forth in sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the merger agreement) have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the closing of the merger, provided that those conditions would be satisfied if the closing were on such date), Parent and Merger Sub fail to

conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger under the debt commitment letter, provided that those conditions would be
satisfied if the closing were on such date) to the consummation of the financing provided for in the debt commitment letter have been satisfied, and the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that the closing will occur if Parent’s equity financing and debt financing are funded
and specific performance is granted. Pursuant to the merger agreement, each of the parties has agreed that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that there is adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy.

ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Financial Engines is providing its stockholders
with a separate advisory (non-binding) vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to its named executive officers in
connection with the merger, as described in the table in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger — Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers in Connection
with the Merger,” including the footnotes to the table and related narrative discussion beginning on page 52 of this proxy statement.

The Financial Engines board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Financial Engines approve the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Financial Engines’ named executive officers in connection with the
merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case, as disclosed
pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the table in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger — Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to the Company’s Named Executive Officers in Connection
with the Merger,” including the footnotes to the table and the related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”

The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only, it will
not be binding on either Financial Engines or Parent. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation
will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto under the applicable compensation agreements and arrangements, regardless of the
outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of Financial Engines’ stockholders.

The above resolution approving the merger-related compensation of Financial Engines’ named executive officers on an advisory (non-binding)
basis requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and
entitled to vote thereon.

The Financial Engines board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Financial Engines vote “FOR” the named
executive officer merger-related compensation proposal.

VOTE ON ADJOURNMENT

The Company’s stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give the Financial Engines board of directors authority to adjourn the
special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum. If this
adjournment proposal is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned by the Financial Engines board of directors to any date (subject to certain
restrictions in the merger agreement, including that the special meeting may not be held, without Parent’s consent, on a date that is more than five
business days prior to the termination date). In addition, the Financial Engines board of directors could postpone the special meeting before it
commences. If the special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies
will be able to revoke them at any time before their use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if
you sign and return a proxy and you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement but do not indicate a choice on
the adjournment proposal, your shares of common stock will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal.

The Company does not anticipate calling a vote on this proposal if the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved by the requisite
number of shares of Financial Engines common stock at the special meeting.

The vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, you
may vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the adjournment proposal and vice versa.

Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or represented
by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon.

The Financial Engines board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Financial Engines vote “FOR” the
adjournment proposal, if a vote on the adjournment proposal is called.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

Under the DGCL, you have the right to dissent from the merger and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of your shares of common stock
as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, as determined by the Court, in lieu of the consideration you would
otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the merger agreement. These rights are known as appraisal rights. Stockholders electing to exercise appraisal rights
must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in order to perfect their rights. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures is required
to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.

The following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of the Delaware statutory procedures required to be followed by a
stockholder in order to dissent from the merger and perfect appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not a complete statement of all applicable
requirements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which appears in Annex C to this proxy statement.
Failure to precisely follow any of the statutory procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss or waiver of your appraisal rights.
All references in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of common stock of the Company unless otherwise indicated.

Beneficial owners of shares of common stock who do not also hold such shares of record may have the registered owner, such as a broker, bank or
other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares. If shares of common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by
a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal should be made in that capacity, and if the shares of common stock are owned of
record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized
agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal on behalf of a stockholder of record; however,
the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the
record owner. In the event a record owner, such as a broker, who holds shares of common stock as a nominee for others, exercises his or her right of
appraisal with respect to the shares of common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners,
we recommend that the written demand state the number of shares of common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares is
expressly mentioned, we will presume that the demand covers all shares held in the name of the record owner. If you hold your shares of common stock
in a brokerage account or in other nominee form and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker or the other nominee to
determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by the nominee.

Section 262 of the DGCL requires that stockholders for whom appraisal rights are available be notified not less than 20 days before the
stockholders meeting to vote on the merger in connection with which appraisal rights will be available. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL must be
included with such notice. This proxy statement constitutes our notice to the Company’s stockholders of the availability of appraisal rights in connection
with the merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and a copy of the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached
hereto as Annex C. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 of the DGCL contained
in Annex C to this proxy statement since failure to timely and properly comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss
of your appraisal rights under the DGCL.

If you elect to demand appraisal of your shares, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:
 

 

•  You must deliver to us a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the vote with respect to the merger is taken. This written
demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption and approval
of the merger agreement and the merger. Voting against or failing to vote for the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the
merger by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The demand must reasonably
inform us of the identity of the stockholder and the intention of

the stockholder to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. A stockholder’s failure to make a written demand before the vote with respect
to the merger is taken will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

 

 

•  You must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. A vote in favor of
the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and merger, by proxy submitted by mail, over the Internet, by telephone or in person,
will constitute a waiver of your appraisal rights in respect of the shares so voted and will nullify any previously filed written demands for
appraisal. A proxy which does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption and approval of the
merger agreement and the merger. Therefore, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote
against the merger agreement and the merger or abstain from voting on the merger agreement and the merger.

 

 
•  You must continue to hold your shares of common stock from the date of making the demand through the effective date of the merger.

Therefore, a stockholder who is the record holder of shares of common stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is made but who
thereafter transfers the shares before the effective date of the merger will lose any right to appraisal with respect to such shares.

 

 •  You must otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262.

If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the merger consideration (without
interest and subject to required withholding taxes), but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of common stock.

All demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be addressed to the Company, in care of the Secretary, at Financial
Engines, Inc., 1050 Enterprise Way, 3rd Floor, Sunnyvale, CA 94089, and must be delivered before the vote on the merger agreement is taken at the
special meeting and should be executed by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the shares of common stock.

Within 10 days after the effective date of the merger, the surviving corporation (i.e., Financial Engines, Inc.) must give written notice that the
merger has become effective to each stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of the merger
agreement and the merger. At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has demanded an appraisal, and who
has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party, has the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for
appraisal and to accept the merger consideration (without interest and subject to required withholding taxes) specified by the merger agreement for his
or her shares of common stock; after this period, the stockholder may withdraw such demand for appraisal only with the consent of the surviving
corporation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL will, upon written
request to the surviving corporation, be entitled to receive a written statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the
merger agreement and the merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal rights have been received and the aggregate number of holders of
such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in
such person’s own name, request from the corporation the statement described in the previous sentence. Such written statement will be mailed to the
requesting stockholder within 10 days after such written request is received by the surviving corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period
for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Within 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter, either the surviving corporation or
any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights may file a
petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. A
person who is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own
name, file the petition described in the previous sentence. Upon the filing of the petition by a stockholder, service of a copy of such petition shall be
made upon the Company, as the surviving corporation. If no such petition is filed within that 120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all holders
of shares who had previously demanded appraisal of their shares. The surviving

Table of Contents

corporation has no obligation to file such a petition in the event there are dissenting stockholders. Accordingly, the failure of a stockholder to file such a
petition within the period specified could nullify the stockholder’s previously written demand for appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of the
Company to file an appraisal petition, and stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the Company will file such a petition
or that the Company will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly, stockholders who desire to have their shares
appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in
Section 262 of the DGCL.

If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, the surviving
corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file in the office of the Register in Chancery in
which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and
with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving corporation. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, must give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving
corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice must also be given by one or more publications at least
one week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication must be approved by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, and the costs thereof will be borne by the surviving corporation. At the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
determine the stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of
Chancery may require the stockholders who have demanded appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their
stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; if any stockholder fails to comply with
that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder. If immediately before the merger the shares of the
class or series of stock as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to
appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for
such total number of shares exceeds $1 million or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to Sections 253 or 267 of the DGCL.

After determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of common stock, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the
shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with
interest, if any. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as otherwise provided in
Section 262, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at
5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the
merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between
the amount paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at
that time. Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal before the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving corporation and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. When the fair value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such

stock forthwith, and in the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the surviving corporation of the certificates
representing such stock.

In determining the fair value of the shares of common stock and, if applicable, interest, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into
account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair
value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial
community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors
involving the value of a company.”

The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light
on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a
“narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”

You should be aware that the fair value of your shares of common stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the
same as, or less than the value that you are entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement and that an opinion of an investment banking
firm as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the merger, is not an opinion as to, and
does not otherwise address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.

Moreover, we do not anticipate offering more than the per share merger consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserve
the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of common stock is less than
the per share merger consideration.

Costs of the appraisal proceeding may be imposed upon the surviving corporation and the stockholders participating in the appraisal proceeding
by the Delaware Court of Chancery as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon the application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to appraisal. In
the absence of an order, each party bears its own expenses. Any stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with
Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the effective time, be entitled to vote shares subject to that demand for any purpose or to receive payments of
dividends or any other distribution with respect to those shares, other than with respect to payment as of a record date before the effective time;
however, if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, or if the stockholder delivers a written withdrawal of
his or her demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the terms of the merger within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the
written approval of the Company, then the right of that stockholder to appraisal will cease. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery
will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the prior approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware
Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a
named party will maintain the right to withdraw its demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration that such holder would have received
(without interest and subject to required withholding taxes) pursuant to the merger agreement within 60 days after the effective date of the merger.

In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, stockholders who may wish to dissent from the merger and pursue appraisal rights should
consult their legal advisors.

that date will not be included in the proxy statement for the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders. We urge stockholders to submit proposals by Certified

principal executive offices of Financial Engines. Under our bylaws, in order for a matter to be deemed properly presented by a stockholder, timely notice
must be delivered to, or mailed and received by, us not more than 120 days nor less than 90 days in advance of the one-year anniversary of the date of
our proxy statement provided in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that we did
not hold an annual meeting in the prior year or if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the prior
year’s annual meeting, we must receive the stockholder’s notice by the close of business on the later of 90 days prior to the annual meeting and the 10th
day after the day we provided such public disclosure of the meeting date.

Dissenting Shares (collectively, “Excluded Shares”)) shall at the Effective Time automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
$45.00 per Share in cash (the “Merger Consideration”), without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes pursuant to Section 2.7(g),
whereupon such Shares will cease to exist and no longer be outstanding, and each holder thereof will cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
Section 2.7.

(b) Cancellation of Cancelled Shares; Conversion of Converted Shares. Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time are held by the
Company in treasury or by Parent or Merger Sub (collectively, “Cancelled Shares”) shall at the Effective Time automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. Shares that immediately prior to the Effective Time are held
by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) (collectively, “Converted Shares”)
shall at the Effective Time automatically be converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.7. Payment.

(a) Paying Agent; Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II, and in connection
therewith, shall enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company relating to the Paying Agent’s responsibilities with respect to this
Agreement. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or shall cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Shares a cash amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”).
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as set forth herein. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as reasonably
directed by Parent; provided, that such investments shall be in short-term obligations of, or guaranteed in full by, the United States of America with
maturities no more than thirty (30) days. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be payable to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under this Article II shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation. To the
extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration under this Article II. No investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent
shall diminish the rights of any holder of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.

(b) Procedures for Surrender.

(i) Common Stock Certificates. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) Business
Days after the date on which the Effective Time occurs), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Record Holder of a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (each such certificate, a “Certificate”), which Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be
in customary form and with such other provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree, and which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss

and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(e))
and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(e)) to the Paying
Agent in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration for which such Shares have been converted pursuant the provisions of this Article II.
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(e)) for cancellation, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II in respect of each Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and
the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(e)) so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable in respect of any Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment has paid all transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate and has established to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid.

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Any holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) and whose Shares were
converted pursuant to the provisions of this Article II into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of
one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an
“agent’s message” in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver (after giving effect to any required withholding Taxes as provided in
Section 2.7(g)) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II in respect of each Share formerly represented by such Book-Entry Share, and the Book-Entry Share so exchanged shall forthwith be
cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered.

(c) Closing of Transfer Books. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Until surrendered as contemplated by Section 2.7(b), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Excluded Shares)
shall, from and after the Effective Time, represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, as contemplated by
Section 2.6(a). If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, such Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article II.

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed
by the Record Holders of Shares one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent,
which shall remain responsible for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares as provided in this Article II, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any Record Holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws.

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, and if required by Parent in its sole discretion, the posting by such holder of a bond in customary amount and
upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent with respect to such Certificate, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent to pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares previously evidenced by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
without any interest thereon.

(f) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required
thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and Converted Shares) and that
are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly
exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”) will
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and had become exchangeable for, at
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The
Company will give Parent (i) reasonably prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments received by the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. Parent shall have the right to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demands, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands; provided that, after the date hereof until the Effective Time,
Parent shall consult with the Company with respect to such negotiations and proceedings. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or compromise, or settle or compromise or otherwise negotiate, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of
any such demands, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise to comply with Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree
to do any of the foregoing.

(g) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such Taxes as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or under any other applicable provision of Law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted and withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.8. Company Equity Awards.

(a) Each outstanding option to acquire Shares (each, a “Company Stock Option”), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested (to the extent unvested) and be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Company
Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option, subject to applicable Tax withholding. Any Company
Stock Option that has an exercise price per Share that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.

(b) Each restricted stock unit award in respect of a Share (each, a “Company RSU Award” and, together with the Company Stock Options, the
“Company Equity Awards”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time:

(i) if granted prior to the date of this Agreement or held by a non-employee director, become fully vested and nonforfeitable, and shall be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each vested Share
subject to such Company RSU Award, subject to applicable Tax withholding, or

(ii) if granted after the date of this Agreement as permitted by this Agreement (other than any Company RSU Award granted to a
non-employee director), be converted automatically into an award representing the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration
in respect of each Share subject to such Company RSU Award (without interest) on the same schedule, and subject to the same terms and conditions
(including with respect to vesting), as were applicable to such Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Equity Awards the cash payments described in Section 2.8(a) and Section 2.8(b)
(i) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter; provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any such delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of a Company RSU
Award that constitutes “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the earliest possible date that such payment
would not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall adopt such resolutions as may reasonably be
appropriate or required in its discretion to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.8.

Section 2.9. Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event that, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company changes
the number of Shares issued and outstanding as a result of a reclassification, stock split or reverse stock split, stock dividend or stock distribution,
recapitalization, combination, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly
adjusted to reflect such change and to provide the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action,
and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration.

similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted, except where the

concept) as a foreign corporation (or other applicable entity) in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or
conduct of its business requires such qualification or licensing, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in
good standing would not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies
of its and its Significant Subsidiaries’ certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents), in each case as amended and in

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the “Parent Disclosure
Schedule”) (it being acknowledged and agreed that (i) disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, whether or
not an explicit cross reference appears, shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is material or constitutes a Parent Material Adverse Effect or that the inclusion of such item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule is
required), Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Section 4.1. Organization. Parent is a limited partnership and Merger Sub is a corporation, in each case, duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and each has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted,
except where the failure to be in good standing or to have such corporate or similar power and authority would not constitute a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
that concept) as a foreign corporation (or other applicable entity) in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets
or conduct of its business requires such qualification or licensing, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in
good standing would not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, a “Parent Material Adverse Effect” means any
fact, circumstance, change, event, occurrence or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, materially impairs, materially delays or prevents, or would
reasonably be expected to materially impair, materially delay or prevent, Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the Merger prior to the Termination
Date. Parent has made available to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the organizational or governing documents of Parent and Merger
Sub, in each case as amended and in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Except as would not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither

negotiations with any other Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal as of the date hereof and request that each such Person
promptly return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company in connection with any such
Acquisition Proposal and (y) not terminate, amend, release or modify any provision of any standstill agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, except that the Company may grant a limited waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or standstill agreement to the extent
necessary to allow for a confidential Acquisition Proposal to be made to the Company or the Company Board so long as the Company promptly (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter) notifies Parent thereof (including the identity of such counterparty (except to the extent prohibited by
any Contract in effect as of the date hereof)) after granting any such limited waiver, amendment or release as provided in Section 5.2(e).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time following the date hereof and
prior to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Company receives a written unsolicited and bona fide Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this Section 5.2, the Company and its Representatives may contact the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition
Proposal to clarify the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
result in, a Superior Proposal, and may (i) provide information to such Person or group of Persons (including their respective Representatives and
prospective equity and debt financing sources) if the Company receives from such Person or group of Persons (or has received from such Person or
group of Persons) an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms that are not less favorable in any material respect to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, except that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any standstill or similar provision (an
“Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”); provided, that the Company shall make available to Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or group of Persons which was not previously made available to Parent
or Merger Sub substantially concurrently (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter), and (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with such Person or group of Persons, if prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, (A) the Company Board determines
in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to result in, a Superior Proposal and (B) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law. It is understood and agreed
that any contacts, disclosures, discussions or negotiations permitted under this Section 5.2(b), including any public announcement that the Company or
the Company Board has made any determination required under this Section 5.2(b) to take or engage in any such actions (provided that the Company
Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation in connection with such disclosure), shall not constitute a Change of
Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4.

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.2(c) or in Section 5.2(d), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (1) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in each case in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, (2) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (3) adopt, approve or recommend or endorse or otherwise
declare advisable, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (4) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company

(10) Business Days from the date of such public disclosure, promptly and in any event prior to the date which is two (2) Business Days before the date
on which the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held) or (5) fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
under the Exchange Act, against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D promulgated under the
Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer
or exchange offer (or if the Stockholders Meeting is

scheduled to be held within ten (10) Business Days from the date of such commencement, promptly and in any event prior to the date which is two
(2) Business Days before the date on which the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held) (any of the foregoing, a “Change of Recommendation”);
provided, that any communication made in accordance with Section 5.2(d)(ii), or the failure by the Company Board to take a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal referred to in the preceding clause (4) or a tender offer or exchange offer referred to in the preceding clause (5), shall not be
deemed a Change of Recommendation if such communication is made or such position is taken prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after the
commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer or the public disclosure of such
Acquisition Proposal, as applicable (or such earlier time as referenced above). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, prior to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may (x) effect a Change of Recommendation contemplated by
clauses (1) or (2) of the definition thereof if, upon the occurrence of an Intervening Event, the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law or (y) if the Company receives after the date hereof an unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Acquisition
Proposal did not result from a material breach by the Company of this Section 5.2, effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.3(a) in order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for such Superior Proposal, and, in the case of either
clause (x) or (y):

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least three (3) Business Days in advance, that it intends to effect a
Change of Recommendation (a “Notice of Change of Recommendation”) and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(a), which
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the Change of Recommendation and/or termination and (A) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof along with a copy of any
proposed agreement in respect of such Superior Proposal (or, if there is no such proposed agreement, a written summary of the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal); or (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, reasonable detail regarding the Intervening Event;

(ii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation and/or terminating this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.3(a), the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives to be available to negotiate, with Parent and Merger
Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) during such three (3) Business Day period to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would obviate the need for the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(a); and

(iii) following the end of such three (3) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and, with respect to clause (A) below, its financial advisor, taking into account any changes to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Change of Recommendation, that (A) the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of
Change of Recommendation continues to be a Superior Proposal or (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to
effect a Change of Recommendation would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.

Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material change to the terms of a Superior Proposal shall require the Company to deliver a new
Notice of Change of Recommendation and the Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of clauses (i)-(iii) above; provided,
however, that references to the three (3) Business Day period above shall then be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day period following
receipt by Parent of any such new Notice of Change of Recommendation.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any
committee thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law or NASDAQ, including taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated

communication to stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to stockholders of
the Company, including any such similar communication in response to an Acquisition Proposal that is not a tender offer or exchange offer); provided,
however, that (x) except as provided in the next sentence, any disclosure made as permitted under clause (i) of this Section 5.2(d) (other than any
“stop-look-and-listen” or similar communication) that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the
Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation in connection with such disclosure, and (y) neither the Company nor the
Company Board (nor any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend any Acquisition Proposal (including that the stockholders of the
Company tender any securities in connection with any tender offer or exchange offer that is an Acquisition Proposal) or otherwise effect a Change of
Recommendation with respect thereto, except as permitted by Section 5.2(c). It is understood and agreed that any “stop-look-and-listen” or similar
communication permitted under clause (ii) of this Section 5.2(d) made prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after the commencement (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer (or, if earlier, no fewer than two (2) Business Days prior to the
date on which the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held) shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for
Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4. The Company shall in no event be deemed to violate this Section 5.2 as a result of
responding to any unsolicited proposal or inquiry solely by advising the Person making such proposal or inquiry of the terms of this Section 5.2.

(e) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if, from and after the date
hereof, any Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry (including any request for non-public information in connection therewith) is received by the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives, indicating (except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law or Contract in effect as of the date
hereof) the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal, Inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of any
such Acquisition Proposal (including, if applicable, providing copies of any written Inquiries and any proposed agreements related thereto). Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall (x) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally and in writing (i) if the
Company determines to begin providing non-public information or to engage in negotiations or discussions concerning an Acquisition Proposal in
accordance with Section 5.2(b) and (ii) thereafter of any change to the financial and other material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal,
and (y) otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material terms of any such Inquiry, Acquisition Proposal, discussions or
negotiations on a reasonably current basis, including by providing a copy of all proposals, offers or drafts of proposed agreements. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit it from
providing such information to Parent.

Section 5.3. Proxy Statement.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days after the date hereof), the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement relating to the Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto, the “Proxy Statement”), and each of the Company and Parent shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to, prepare
and file with the SEC all other documents required by the Exchange Act in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement and any such other filings.
Except as permitted by Section 5.2, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation; provided, that if the Company Board shall have
effected a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.2, then in submitting this Agreement to the Company’s stockholders, the Company
Board may submit this Agreement to the Company’s stockholders without the Company Recommendation, in which event the Company Board may
communicate the basis for its lack of recommendation to the Company’s stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment thereof or
supplement thereto. Parent agrees to provide or cause to be provided all information with

transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly provide responses to the SEC with
respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement from the SEC and to make any amendments or filings as may be necessary in connection
therewith and (ii) have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC staff as soon as reasonably practical after such filing. The Company shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments

thereof or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall (unless and until a Change of
Recommendation has occurred or in connection with the matters described in Section 5.2) provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on
(which comments shall be made promptly) such document or response and shall consider in good faith including in such document or response
comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

(d) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, should be
set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and the Company
and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. Nothing
in this Section 5.3(d) shall limit the rights or obligations of any party under any other paragraph of this Section 5.3.

(e) All documents that the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger will comply as to form and substance in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.

necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of holders of Shares (including any adjournment or postponement thereof as permitted
by this Section 5.4, the “Stockholders Meeting”) as promptly as reasonably practicable following clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC to
consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement; provided, that the Company may postpone or adjourn to a later date the Stockholders Meeting
(i) with the written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) for the absence of a quorum,
(iii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies if the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
of Common Stock to adopt this Agreement, whether or not a quorum is present, (iv) if required by applicable Law or (v) to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation
with outside legal counsel), the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under

Days prior to the Termination Date without the prior written consent of Parent. Unless there has been a Change of Recommendation pursuant to
Section 5.2, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to lawfully obtain the Stockholder Approval, including actively soliciting proxies in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not
submit to the vote of its stockholders any other Acquisition Proposal.

(b) The Company shall keep Parent informed with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent and shall provide such
information and reasonable cooperation as Parent may reasonably request in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall remain obligated to provide the information and
cooperation described in the immediately preceding sentence and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting and mail the
Proxy Statement (and any amendment or supplement thereto that maybe required by applicable Law) to the Company’s stockholders in accordance with

use their reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other in doing (and, in the case of Parent, to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Equity Investors and their Affiliates to assist and cooperate as
necessary or appropriate with the other parties), all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement or applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including to (i) obtain from any Governmental
Entities and any third parties any actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, permits

third party to obtain any consent or approval required for the consummation of the Merger under any Contract; provided, further, that without the prior
written consent of Parent, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to any third party whose consent or approval is being
solicited any amount of cash or other consideration , make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation in connection therewith (in each
case of this proviso other than filing fees in connection with the actions described in the preceding clause (ii), reimbursements for reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any such third party in connection with obtaining its consent or approval, or de minimis cash or other
consideration). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, all obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to obtain

Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after

any other applicable Regulatory Law as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, and to supply, or cause to be supplied, as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information and material that may be requested by a Governmental Entity pursuant to any Regulatory Law. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the parties shall request and use reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting

contemplated hereby under any Regulatory Law. If any Action, including any Action by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Regulatory Law, the Company shall (and cause its Subsidiaries to), Parent shall

respective Subsidiaries to, (x) negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of

actions that after the Closing Date limit Parent’s or its Subsidiaries’ (including the Surviving Corporation’s) freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, one or more businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), in each case as
may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
Closing, materially delaying the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the Termination Date; provided, that the Company will only be required to take
or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, if such action, commitment, agreement, condition or restriction is
binding on the Company only if and when the Closing occurs.

connection with, arising from or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (“Transaction Litigation”) or (iii) if such
party becomes aware of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any
condition to the obligations of any party hereto to effect the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied;

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary thereof, Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiary to, provide each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues in employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (collectively, the “Continuing Employees”) with (i) a base salary or regular hourly wage (whichever is
applicable) and a short-term cash incentive compensation opportunity, that, in each case, is not less than the base salary or regular hourly wage and
short-term cash incentive compensation opportunity in effect for, or available to, the applicable Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) other compensation opportunities (excluding any equity award or other long-term compensation opportunities) and employee
benefits (excluding any severance-related benefits) that are, in each case, substantially similar in the aggregate to the other compensation (excluding any
equity award or other long-term compensation opportunities) and employee benefits (excluding any severance-related benefits), respectively, provided
or available to the applicable Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation hereby expressly assumes the Company Benefit Plans and agrees to perform the obligations of the Company thereunder in accordance with
the terms and conditions thereof.

(b) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary thereof, the Surviving Corporation shall provide each
Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries with severance benefits and on terms and conditions, in each
case, that are no less favorable than the severance benefits and protections provided to each such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time as set forth in Section 5.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (or, if greater, those applicable to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any broad-based severance program).

(c) Parent will cause any employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees are entitled to participate after
the Closing Date to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals (other than benefit accruals under any defined benefit

(and any predecessors) as if such service were with Parent or its Subsidiaries.

(d) With respect to any employee benefit plans maintained by Parent and its Subsidiaries for the benefit of the Continuing Employees following

period requirements with respect to any such plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee to the same
extent waived under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible, co-insurance and
maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to any eligible expenses paid by such employees during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs (or
such later date on which a Continuing Employee commences participation in any new plan of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) under
analogous Company Benefit Plans.

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, pay to each Continuing Employee who remains employed through December 31, 2018
(whether or not employed on the payment date), an annual incentive bonus in respect of 2018, payable no later than March 15, 2019, equal to the bonus
that such employee would have earned based upon actual performance through December 31, 2018; provided, however, that actual performance shall be
determined in a manner that is consistent with the Company’s past practice and shall exclude any costs and expenses associated with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any nonrecurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred by the Company and its
Subsidiaries had the transactions contemplated by the Agreement not occurred. Each Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated on or after
the Closing Date and before December 31, 2018 in a severance-qualifying termination (as defined in Section 5.8(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) will be entitled to receive a prorated bonus in respect of 2018 equal to the product of (A) such Continuing Employee’s target bonus
opportunity, multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from January 1, 2018 through the date of such Continuing
Employee’s termination of employment and the denominator of which is 365.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing
Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend,
or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms after the Closing Date. Without limiting Section 8.9,
nothing in this Section 5.8 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee or current or former service provider of the
Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 5.9. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or each Limited Guarantee, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by the party incurring such expense, except that all filing fees under the HSR Act in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be borne by Parent.

Section 5.10. Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and each fiduciary
of a Company Benefit Plan (collectively, together with such person’s heirs, executors or administrators, the “Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred in
connection with any actual or threatened Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, related to or in connection with
any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether prior to or at the Effective Time (including in connection with such Indemnified

of a Company Benefit Plan or services performed by such persons at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification, exculpation or advancement right of any Indemnified Party.
Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, shall, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable
Law, cause the Charter and the Bylaws to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties with respect to indemnification, exculpation
from liabilities and rights to advancement of expenses than those set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any Indemnified Party. In addition, from and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall advance costs and expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) as incurred by any Indemnified Party promptly (and in any event within ten (10) days) after receipt by Parent of a written
request for such advance to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided, that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined (after exhausting all available appeals) that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.10(a), upon learning of any claim, action or proceeding in
respect of which such indemnification will be sought, shall notify the Surviving Corporation thereof in writing; provided, that the failure to so notify the
Surviving Corporation shall not affect the indemnification obligations of the Surviving Corporation or Parent under this Section 5.10(a), except to the
extent such failure to notify materially prejudices the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pre-pay the premium for (and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain with reputable and financially sound carriers) the extension of (i) the
directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies, and (ii) the Company’s existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies (collectively, “D&O Insurance”), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period (whichever is greater) of six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim arising from facts or events that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time with terms, conditions, retentions, coverage limits and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided under the
Company’s existing policies in effect on the date hereof. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such “tail”
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the D&O Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions,
coverage limits and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof, or
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable insurance as the D&O Insurance for such
six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided under the Company’s
existing policies as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) in no event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend for any such policies pursuant to this Section 5.10(b) an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the aggregate of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance, and (y) if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such maximum amount, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for such maximum amount.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that such surviving or
acquiring Person(s), as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.10 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under any applicable Contracts or
Laws or otherwise. All rights to indemnification, exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights
to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the
Effective Time) as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any Contract or otherwise between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in full
force and effect (and shall be so maintained) and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Indemnified
Party, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.10 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims
under any such policies.

Section 5.11. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause any dispositions of
equity securities (including derivative securities) of the Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.12. Financing.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and shall use reasonable best efforts to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letters (including, as necessary, the “flex” provisions contained in any related fee letter) as promptly as possible (taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period) but in any event on or prior to the date upon which the Merger is required to be consummated pursuant to the
terms hereof, including by using reasonable best efforts with respect to (i) causing the Equity Investors to maintain in effect the Equity Commitment
Letter, (ii) maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) negotiating and entering into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing
(the “Definitive Agreements”) consistent with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, as necessary, the “flex”
provisions contained in any related fee letter) or, if available, on other terms that (A) are acceptable to Parent in its sole discretion, (B) would not
reasonably be expected to delay (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) or adversely affect the ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (C) would otherwise be permitted by Section 5.12(b), and (iv) taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period, satisfying (or, if reasonably required to obtain the Financing, seeking the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions in
the Debt Commitment Letters and the Definitive Agreements that are within the control of Parent or Merger Sub and complying with its obligations
thereunder. In the event that all conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements (other than the consummation of the
Merger and other than the availability of the Cash Equity and those that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders thereunder to comply with their respective obligations thereunder,
including to fund the Debt Financing (including, subject to Section 8.7(c), by promptly commencing a litigation proceeding against any breaching
Lender or other financial institution to compel such Lender or financial institution to provide its portion of the Debt Financing or otherwise comply with
its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreement). Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
comply with its respective obligations, and enforce its respective rights, under the Commitment Letters and Definitive Agreements in a timely and
diligent manner.

(b) Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, without the prior written consent of the Company: (i) permit any amendment or
modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification or waiver (A) adds new (or
adversely modifies any existing) conditions

to the consummation of all or any portion of the Financing, (B) reduces the amount of the Financing to an amount that, together with available cash at
the Company and its Subsidiaries and other available cash or other funds of Parent and its Subsidiaries, would on the Closing Date be less than the
Merger Amounts, (C) adversely affects in a material respect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters or
the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable,
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof or (D) could otherwise reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period); or (ii) terminate any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement unless such Commitment
Letter or Definitive Agreement is replaced at such time with a new commitment letter or a new definitive agreement that would satisfy the preceding
clause (i). Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of any
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement.

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent and Merger Sub will (i) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with Cash Equity and the available portion of
the Debt Financing, the available cash at the Company and its Subsidiaries and other available funds or cash to Parent and its Subsidiaries, to pay the
Merger Consideration and the other Merger Amounts) from the same or other sources on terms and conditions that are not less favorable to Parent and
its Subsidiaries than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and which do not include any conditions to
the consummation of such alternative debt financing that would reasonably be expected to make the funding of such alternative debt financing less
likely to occur, than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such
unavailability and the reason therefor. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Debt Commitment Letter” shall be deemed to include any
commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative or replacement financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt
Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in question). Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company with prompt oral and written notice
of any actual or threatened breach, termination, repudiation or default by any party to any Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement, in each
case, of which Parent or Merger Sub obtain Knowledge and the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any Lender, Equity
Investor or other financing source with respect to any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter or any
Definitive Agreement of any provision thereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of
its efforts to consummate the Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding, compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with this Section 5.12 shall not relieve
Parent or Merger Sub of their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing is available.

Section 5.13. Financing Cooperation.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to,
and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its and their Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent necessary and
customary for the arrangement of the Debt Financing (provided, that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), including by (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including meetings with
prospective Lenders), presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, at reasonable times and with reasonable
advance notice, (ii) to the extent required by the Debt Financing, using reasonable efforts to facilitate the pledging of, and perfection of security interests
in, collateral, effective no earlier than the Effective Time, (iii) furnishing Parent and the Lenders as promptly as reasonably practicable the financial
statements of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries required by paragraph 5 in Exhibit D to the Debt Commitment Letter (such financial
statements, the “Required Financial Information”) and, following the delivery of a request therefor to the Company by Parent (which notice shall state
with specificity the information requested), such financial and other information regarding the Company as

(C) definitive documentation for the Debt Financing, (vi) following Parent’s reasonable request, using reasonable best efforts to cause directors and

Subsidiaries that do not become effective until the Effective Time with respect to entering into the definitive documentation for the Debt Financing and
otherwise as necessary to authorize consummation of the Debt Financing and (vii) if requested by Parent, provide, at least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, all documentation and other information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as is required by applicable “know your
customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act to the extent requested by Parent in writing at least nine
(9) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or
permit the taking of any action pursuant to this Section 5.13 that (A) would require the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing that is effective prior to the
Effective Time or execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any change or modification of any existing
certificate, document, instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the Effective Time, (B) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement
to be breached by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other similar fee

that is effective prior to the Effective Time or that would be effective if the Closing does not occur. Nothing contained in this Section 5.13 or otherwise
shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing. Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the cooperation contemplated by this Section 5.13 and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to this Section 5.13 and any

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Financial Engines, Inc. (“Company”), Edelman Financial, L.P. (“Parent”) and Flashdance Merger Sub, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (“Merger Sub”), are proposing to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge
with and into Company with Company as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share
of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Company (the “Company Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except for shares of Company Common Stock as set forth in the Agreement, shall be converted into the right to receive $45.00 in cash, without
interest (the “Merger Consideration”). In addition, as set forth in more detail in the Agreement, Parent is party to and has accepted (a) a fully executed
commitment letter, dated April 29, 2018 (together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the “Debt Commitment Letter”), from the lenders party thereto
(collectively, the “Lenders”) pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide debt financing in the
amounts set forth therein (the “Debt Financing”), and (b) a fully executed commitment letter, dated April 29, 2018 (together with all exhibits and
schedules thereto, the “Equity Commitment Letter” and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the “Commitment Letters”), from (i) Hellman &
Friedman Capital Partners VIII, L.P., (ii) Hellman & Friedman Capital Partners VIII (Parallel), L.P., (iii) HFCP VIII (Parallel-A), L.P., (iv) H&F
Executives VIII, L.P. and (v) H&F Associates VIII, L.P. (collectively, the “Equity Investors”) pursuant to which the Equity Investors have agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent the amounts set forth therein (the “Cash Equity”, and together with the Debt Financing,
the “Financing”). Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement. You have requested our
opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of Company Common Stock.

Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. (“Sandler O’Neill”, “we” or “our”), as part of its investment banking business, is regularly engaged in the
valuation of asset management and financial technology companies and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other corporate
transactions. In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed and considered, among other things: (i) an execution version of the Agreement, dated
April 29, 2018; (ii) copies of the Commitment Letters and the financial terms of the Financing; (iii) certain publicly available financial statements and
other historical financial information of Company that we deemed relevant; (iv) certain publicly available information relating to Parent that we deemed
relevant; (v) publicly available mean and median analyst adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share estimates for Company for the years ending
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019; (vi) certain internal financial projections, including estimated adjusted EBITDA, for Company for the year
ending December 31, 2018, as provided by the senior management of Company, as well as estimated annual growth rates of pro forma adjusted
EBITDA for the Company for the years thereafter, as discussed with the senior management of Company; (vii) the publicly reported historical price and
trading activity for Company Common Stock, including a comparison of certain stock market information for Company Common Stock and certain
stock indices, as well as publicly available information for certain other similar companies, the securities of which are publicly traded; (viii) a
comparison of certain financial information for Company with similar institutions for which information is publicly available; (ix) the financial terms of
certain recent business combinations in the financial technology and asset management industries, to the extent publicly available; (x) the current market
environment generally and the

financial technology and asset management environments in particular; and (xi) such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations
and financial, economic and market criteria as we considered relevant. We also discussed with certain members of the senior management of Company
the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of Company.

In performing our review, we have relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information that was available to
and reviewed by us from public sources, that was provided to us by Company or its representatives or that was otherwise reviewed by us and we have
assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering this opinion without any independent verification or investigation. We have relied
on the assurances of the senior management of Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make any of such information
inaccurate or misleading. We have not been asked to and have not undertaken an independent verification of any of such information and we do not
assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof. We did not make an independent evaluation or perform an appraisal of
the specific assets, the collateral securing assets or the liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Company or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, nor have
we been furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. We render no opinion or evaluation on the collectability of any assets of Company or any of
its affiliates or subsidiaries.

In preparing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill used certain internal financial projections, including estimated adjusted EBITDA, for Company for the
year ending December 31, 2018, as provided by the senior management of Company, as well as estimated annual growth rates of pro forma adjusted
EBITDA for the Company for the years thereafter, as discussed with the senior management of Company. With respect to the foregoing information, the
senior management of Company confirmed to us that such information reflected the best currently available estimates of management of the future
financial performance of Company and we assumed that such performance would be achieved. We express no opinion as to such estimates, or the
assumptions on which they are based. We have also assumed that there has been no material change in Company’s or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries
assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects since the date of the most recent financial statements made available to us. We
have assumed in all respects material to our analysis that Company will remain as a going concern for all periods relevant to our analyses.

We have also assumed, with your consent, that (i) each of the parties to the Agreement will comply in all material respects with all material terms
and conditions that are pertinent to our analysis of the Agreement and all related agreements, that all of the representations and warranties contained in
such agreements are true and correct except as would not give rise to the failure of a condition to the closing of the Merger set forth in the Merger
Agreement, that each of the parties to such agreements will perform in all material respects all of the covenants and other obligations required to be
performed by such party under such agreements and that are pertinent to our analysis and that the conditions precedent in such agreements are not and
will not be waived, (ii) in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases with respect to the Merger, no
delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any related
transactions, and (iii) the Merger and any related transactions will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement without any waiver,
modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof and in compliance with all applicable laws and other requirements. We
express no opinion as to any of the legal, accounting or tax matters relating to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated in connection
therewith.

Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as
of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof could materially affect this opinion. We have not undertaken to update, revise, reaffirm or
withdraw this opinion or otherwise comment upon events occurring after the date hereof.

We have acted as Company’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger and will receive a transaction fee for our services, which transaction
fee is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. We will also receive

a fee for rendering this opinion, which opinion fee will be credited in full towards the transaction fee which will become payable to Sandler O’Neill on
the day of closing of the Merger. Company has also agreed to indemnify us against certain claims and liabilities arising out of our engagement and to
reimburse us for certain of our out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with our engagement. We have not provided any other investment banking
services to Company in the two years preceding the date hereof, nor have we provided any investment banking services to Parent or Merger Sub in the
two years preceding the date hereof. In the ordinary course of our business as a broker-dealer, we may purchase securities from and sell securities to
Company and its affiliates. We may also actively trade the equity and debt securities of Company and its affiliates for our own account and for the
accounts of our customers.

Our opinion is directed to, and is for the benefit of, the Board of Directors of Company in connection with its consideration of the Agreement and
Merger. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company as to how any such shareholder should vote at any
meeting of shareholders called to consider and vote upon the adoption of the Agreement and approval of the Merger. Our opinion is directed only to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of Company Common Stock and does not address the underlying
business decision of Company to engage in the Merger, the form or structure of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated in the Agreement, the
relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative transactions or business strategies that might exist for Company or the effect of any
other transaction in which Company might engage. We express no opinion as to the amount of compensation to be received in the Merger by any
Company officer, director or employee, or any class of such persons, if any, relative to the amount of compensation to be received by any other
shareholder. This opinion has been approved by Sandler O’Neill’s fairness opinion committee. This opinion shall not be reproduced without Sandler
O’Neill’s prior written consent; provided, however, Sandler O’Neill will provide its consent for the opinion to be included in regulatory filings to be
completed in connection with the Merger.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Company Common Stock.

 
Very truly yours,

Annex C

Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware

§ 262. Appraisal rights.

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of
this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise
complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant
to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the
circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a
corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a
receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this
title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for
the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the
stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed
on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available
for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders
of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series
of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to
§§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in
respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this
section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is
not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall
be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the

procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word
“amendment” substituted for the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent corporation”
and/or “surviving or resulting corporation.”

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for
which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of
the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the
corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such
demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to
demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of
such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has
complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation
has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation
before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the
holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or
consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall
include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such
notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of
the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case
of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and
20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s
shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation
notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date
of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days
after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to

§ 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending
of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of
such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the
corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts
stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a
record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the
effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by
filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon
the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger
or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with
respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed
to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or
within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee
on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation,
which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing
the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have
not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by
publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled
to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by
certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any
stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or
consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national
securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless

(1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the
consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to
§ 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules
of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair
value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant
factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon
application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its
discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name
appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such
stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of
holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be
enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of
any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances.
Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in
subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock
(except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation);
provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall
deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or
consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with
the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal
proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s
