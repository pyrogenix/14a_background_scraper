MERGER PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Stockholders:

          On April 20, 2017, KCG Holdings, Inc. (which we refer to as the "Company") and Virtu Financial, Inc. (which we refer to as "Virtu") entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (which we refer to as the "merger agreement") that provides for Virtu to acquire the Company in an all cash transaction for $20.00 per share of outstanding Company
common stock. Under the merger agreement, Orchestra Merger Sub, Inc. (which we refer to as "Merger Sub"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Virtu, will merge with and
into the Company (which we refer to as the "merger"), so that the Company will be the surviving entity in the merger and will be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Virtu
when the merger is completed.

          In the merger, each share of the Company's Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (which we refer to as the "Company common stock" and holders of which we
refer to as "Company stockholders"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (except for specified shares of Company common stock held by
the Company or owned by Virtu or Merger Sub, and shares of Company common stock held by stockholders who properly exercise dissenters' rights) will be automatically
converted into the right to receive $20.00 in cash without interest (which we refer to as the "merger consideration"). The merger consideration represents a premium of
approximately 12.7% over $17.74, the closing price of Company common stock on The New York Stock Exchange (which we refer to as the "NYSE") on April 19, 2017, the last
trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger agreement, and a premium of approximately 45.7% over $13.73, the closing price of Company common stock on the
NYSE on March 14, 2017, the last trading day prior to the date on which a news organization reported publicly that Virtu had made an offer to purchase the Company. On
May 31, 2017, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was mailed to our stockholders, the closing price for Company common stock on the NYSE was
$19.86 per share. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for KCG Holdings, Inc. (trading symbol "KCG").

          As a condition and inducement to the willingness of Virtu to enter into the merger agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, Virtu
entered into a voting agreement with Jefferies LLC (which we refer to as "Jefferies"), a stockholder of the Company, which beneficially owned 15,935,031 shares of Company
common stock as of the record date, representing approximately 23.4% of the outstanding Company common stock as of the record date. The voting agreement requires Jefferies,
among other things, to vote all shares of Company common stock that Jefferies is entitled to vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger.

          The Company will hold a special meeting of its stockholders (which we refer to as the "special meeting") in connection with the merger. Company stockholders will be
asked to vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve related matters, as described in the attached proxy statement. Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such question.

          The special meeting will be held on July 12, 2017, at 1:00 p.m., local time, at our principal executive offices, which are located at 300 Vesey Street, New York, New
York 10282.

          Your vote is very important. To ensure your representation at the special meeting, please complete and return the enclosed proxy card or submit your proxy by
telephone or through the Internet. Please vote promptly whether or not you expect to attend the special meeting. Submitting a proxy now will not prevent you from
being able to vote in person at the special meeting.

          The board of directors of the Company has determined that the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders and has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and declared it advisable that the Company enter into the merger agreement. The
board of directors of the Company unanimously recommends that Company stockholders vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement and "FOR" the other
matters to be considered at the special meeting.

          The accompanying proxy statement provides detailed information about the special meeting, the merger, the merger agreement, the documents related to the merger and
other related matters. Please carefully read the entire proxy statement for discussions of the risks relating to the proposed merger. You can also obtain information about
the Company from documents that the Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

          On behalf of the board of directors of the Company, thank you for your cooperation and continued support of the Company.

          Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved the merger, passed upon the merits or fairness of the
merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in this proxy statement. Any representation to the contrary
is a criminal offense.

          The date of this proxy statement is June 1, 2017 and it is first being mailed or otherwise delivered to the Company's stockholders on or about June 1, 2017.

  Sincerely,

 
Daniel Coleman
Chief Executive Officer

300 Vesey Street

New York, New York 10282

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

To be held on July 12, 2017

          NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that KCG Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (which we refer to as the "Company"), will hold a special meeting of holders of Class A common stock of the Company (which we refer to as
"Company common stock" and holders of which we refer to as "Company stockholders") on July 12, 2017, at 1:00 p.m., local time, at our principal executive offices, which are located at 300 Vesey Street, New York, New York
10282 (which we refer to as the "special meeting") to consider and vote upon the following matters:

1. A proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 20, 2017, by and among the Company, Virtu Financial, Inc. (which we refer to as "Virtu") and Orchestra Merger Sub, Inc. (which we
refer to as "Merger Sub"), as such agreement may be amended from time to time (which we refer to as the "merger agreement"), a copy of which is attached as Annex A (which we refer to as the "merger
proposal"); 

2. A proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that certain executive officers of the Company may receive in connection with the merger pursuant to agreements or arrangements with
the Company (which we refer to as the "compensation proposal"); and 

3. A proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including adjournments to permit further solicitation of proxies in favor of the merger proposal (which we
refer to as the "adjournment proposal").

          The board of directors of the Company has fixed the close of business on May 24, 2017 as the record date for the special meeting. Only Company stockholders of record at that time are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Adoption of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote
on such question. Approval of each of the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Company common stock present or represented by
proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on such question.

          The board of directors of the Company has determined that the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and has unanimously approved the
merger agreement and the merger and declared it advisable that the Company enter into the merger agreement. The board of directors of the Company unanimously recommends that Company stockholders vote
"FOR" the merger proposal, "FOR" the compensation proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

          Your vote is very important.    We cannot complete the merger unless Company stockholders approve the merger proposal.

          Each copy of the proxy statement mailed to Company stockholders is accompanied by a form of proxy card with instructions for voting. Regardless of whether you plan to attend the special meeting, please vote as soon as
possible by accessing the Internet site listed on the proxy card, voting telephonically using the phone number listed on the proxy card or submitting your proxy card by mail. If you hold stock in your name as a stockholder of record
and are voting by mail, please complete, sign, date and return the accompanying proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope. This will not prevent you from voting in person, but it will help to secure a quorum and
avoid added solicitation costs. Any holder of record of Company common stock who is present at the special meeting may vote in person instead of by proxy, thereby canceling any previous proxy. In any event, a proxy may be
revoked at any time before the special meeting in the manner described in the accompanying proxy statement. Information and applicable deadlines for voting through the Internet or by telephone are set forth in the enclosed proxy
card instructions. If you hold your stock in "street name" through a bank, broker or other holder of record, please follow the instructions on the voting instruction card furnished by the record holder.

          Under Delaware law, Company stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger proposal will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of Company common stock as determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery if the merger is completed, but only if they submit a written demand for such an appraisal prior to the vote on the merger proposal and comply with the other procedures set forth in Section 262 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law, the text of which can be found in Annex D to the accompanying proxy statement and the requirements of which section are incorporated in this notice by reference and summarized in the
accompanying proxy statement. Company stockholders who do not vote in favor of the merger proposal, who submit a written demand for such an appraisal prior to the vote on the merger proposal and who comply with the other
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law will not receive the merger consideration.

          The enclosed proxy statement provides a detailed description of the special meeting, the merger, the merger agreement, the documents related to the merger and other related matters. We urge you to read the proxy
statement, including any documents incorporated in the proxy statement by reference, and its annexes carefully and in their entirety.

Date: June 1, 2017

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        The following are some questions that you may have about the merger and the special meeting and brief answers to those questions. We urge you to read carefully the
remainder of this proxy statement because the information in this section does not provide all of the information that might be important to you with respect to the merger or the
special meeting. Additional important information is also contained in the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. See "Where You Can Find More
Information."

Q: What is the merger? 

A: KCG Holdings, Inc. (which we refer to as the "Company"), Virtu Financial, Inc. (which we refer to as "Virtu") and Orchestra Merger Sub, Inc. (which we refer to as
"Merger Sub") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated April 20, 2017, as such agreement may be amended from time to time (which we refer to as the
"merger agreement"). Under the merger agreement, Merger Sub, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Virtu, will merge with and into the Company (which we refer to
as the "merger"), so that the Company will be the surviving entity in the merger (which we refer to as the "surviving corporation") and will be an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Virtu when the merger is completed. A copy of the merger agreement is included in this proxy statement as Annex A. 

The merger cannot be completed unless, among other things, the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved by the holders of a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of Class A common stock of the Company (which we refer to as "Company common stock" and holders of which we refer to as "Company
stockholders") entitled to vote on such question.

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement? 

A: We are delivering this document to you because it is a proxy statement being used by the board of directors of the Company (which we refer to as the "Company board")
to solicit proxies of Company stockholders in connection with the adoption of the merger agreement and related matters. 

The Company has called a special meeting of its stockholders (which we refer to as the "special meeting") to adopt the merger agreement and approve related matters.
This document serves as the proxy statement for the special meeting and describes the proposals to be presented at the special meeting.

This proxy statement contains important information about the merger and the other proposals being voted on at the special meeting. You should read it carefully and in
its entirety. The enclosed materials allow you to have your shares of Company common stock voted by proxy without attending the special meeting. Your vote is
important and we encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible.

Q: What are Company stockholders being asked to vote on at the special meeting? 

A: The Company is soliciting proxies from Company stockholders with respect to the following proposals: 

1. A proposal to adopt the merger agreement (which we refer to as the "merger proposal"); 

2. A proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that certain executive officers of the Company may receive in connection with the
merger pursuant to agreements or arrangements with the Company, as described in "Advisory Vote on

Table of Contents

Merger-Related Compensation for the Company's Named Executive Officers" (which we refer to as the "compensation proposal"); and

3. A proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including adjournments to permit further solicitation of
proxies in favor of the merger proposal (which we refer to as the "adjournment proposal"). 

Q: What will Company stockholders receive in the merger? 

A: In the merger, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as the "effective
time"), except for specified shares held by the Company or owned by Virtu or Merger Sub and shares of Company common stock held by Company stockholders who
properly exercise dissenters' rights, will be converted into the right to receive $20.00 in cash without interest (which we refer to as the "merger consideration"). 

Q: How will the merger affect Company equity awards? 

A: The Company equity awards will be affected as follows: 

Stock Options:    At the effective time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company common stock (which we refer to as a "stock option") granted under the
Company's Amended and Restated Equity Plan (which we refer to as the "Company stock plan") will be cancelled and will entitle the holder thereof to receive an amount
in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to the stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (y) the excess,
if any, of the merger consideration of $20.00 per share over the exercise price per share of such stock option, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment. Any stock option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the merger consideration of $20.00 per share will be cancelled at the
effective time for no consideration or payment.

Stock Appreciation Rights:    At the effective time, each outstanding stock appreciation right (which we refer to as a "SAR") granted under the Company stock plan will
be cancelled and will entitle the holder thereof to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such
SAR immediately prior to the effective time and (y) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration of $20.00 per share over the exercise price per share of such SAR, less
applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Because all outstanding SARs have an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the
merger consideration of $20.00 per share, all SARs will be cancelled at the effective time for no consideration or payment.

Restricted Stock Units:    At the effective time, each outstanding restricted stock unit (which we refer to as an "RSU") under the Company stock plan, whether vested or
unvested, will be cancelled and will entitle the holder thereof to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company common stock
subject to such RSU immediately prior to the effective time and (y) the merger consideration of $20.00 per share, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment.

Q: What will holders of Company warrants receive in the merger? 

A: In the merger, each of the Company's warrants to purchase shares of the Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company common stock subject to such
Company warrant and (B) the excess, if any, of the

Table of Contents

merger consideration over the then-current exercise price per share of Company common stock (without giving effect to any of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement) previously subject to such Company warrant, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

Q: How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of Company common stock? 

A: The merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 12.7% over $17.74, the closing price of Company common stock on The New York Stock Exchange
(which we refer to as the "NYSE") on April 19, 2017, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger agreement, and a premium of approximately
45.7% over $13.73, the closing price of Company common stock on the NYSE on March 14, 2017, the last trading day prior to the date on which a news organization
reported publicly that Virtu had made an offer to purchase the Company. On May 31, 2017, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was mailed to our
stockholders, the closing price for Company common stock on the NYSE was $19.86 per share. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for Company
common stock in connection with voting your shares. 

Q: How does the Company board recommend that I vote at the special meeting? 

A: The Company board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the merger proposal, "FOR" the compensation proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal. 

Q: Why am I being asked to consider and vote on, by non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation proposal? 

A: Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the "SEC") rules require the Company to seek a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that will
or may become payable by the Company to its named executive officers in connection with the merger. 

Q: When and where is the special meeting? 

A: The special meeting will be held on July 12, 2017, at 1:00 p.m., local time, at our principal executive offices, which are located at 300 Vesey Street, New York, New
York 10282. 

Q: What do I need to do now? 

A: After you have carefully read this proxy statement and have decided how you wish to vote your shares of Company common stock, please vote your shares promptly so
that your shares are represented and voted at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in your name as a stockholder of record, you can complete, sign, date and mail
your proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope, and we request that you do this as soon as possible. Alternatively, you may vote through the Internet or by
telephone. Information and applicable deadlines for voting through the Internet or by telephone are set forth in the enclosed proxy card instructions. If you hold your
shares in "street name" through a bank, broker or other holder of record, you must direct the record holder of your shares how to vote in accordance with the instructions
you have received from such record holder. A "street name" stockholder who wishes to vote in person at the special meeting will need to obtain a legal proxy from the
institution that holds its shares. 

Q: What constitutes a quorum for the special meeting? 

A: The presence, in person or by properly executed or otherwise documented proxy, of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company common

The Company cannot hold the meeting unless a quorum is present. Abstentions will be counted in determining the number of shares present at the meeting solely for the
purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.

We urge you to vote promptly by proxy even if you plan to attend the meeting so that we will know as soon as possible that enough shares will be present for us to hold
the meeting.

Q: What is the vote required to approve each proposal at the special meeting? 

A: Merger Proposal: 

• Standard:  Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company common
stock entitled to vote on such question. 

• Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes:  If you fail to vote, mark "ABSTAIN" on your proxy or fail to instruct your bank, broker or other holder of record with
respect to the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal. 

Compensation Proposal:

• Standard:  Approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of
Company common stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on such question. 

• Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes:  If you mark "ABSTAIN" on your proxy card, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal. If you
fail to submit a proxy card or vote in person at the special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank, broker or other holder of record how to vote with respect to the
adjournment proposal, it will have no effect on the proposal. 

Adjournment Proposal:

• Standard:  Whether or not a quorum is present, approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares
of Company common stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on such question. 

• Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes:  If you mark "ABSTAIN" on your proxy card, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal. If you
fail to submit a proxy card or vote in person at the special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank, broker or other holder of record how to vote with respect to the
adjournment proposal, it will have no effect on the proposal. 

Q: Why is my vote important? 

A: If you do not vote, it will be more difficult for the Company to obtain the necessary quorum to hold the special meeting. In addition, your failure to submit a proxy or vote
in person, your failure to instruct your bank or broker how to vote or your abstention will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the adoption of the merger
agreement. 

Q: If my shares of Company common stock are held in "street name" by my bank, broker or other holder of record, will my bank, broker or other holder of
record automatically vote my shares for me? 

A: No. Your bank, broker or other holder of record cannot vote your shares without instructions from you. If your shares are held in "street name" through a bank, broker or
other holder of record,

Table of Contents

you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by such record holder. You
may not vote shares held in "street name" by returning a proxy card directly to the Company, or by voting in person at the special meeting, unless you provide a legal
proxy, which you must obtain from the record holder of your shares. Further, banks, brokers or other holders of record who hold shares of Company common stock on
behalf of their customers may not give a proxy to the Company to vote those shares with respect to any of the proposals without specific instructions from their
customers, as banks, brokers and other holders of record do not have discretionary voting power on these matters. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other holder of
record how to vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" adoption of the merger agreement.

Q: Can Company stockholders attend the special meetings and vote their shares in person? 

A: Yes. All Company stockholders, including stockholders of record and stockholders who hold their shares through banks, brokers or other holders of record, are invited to
attend the special meeting. Stockholders of record of Company common stock can vote in person at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record (in other
words, if your shares are held for you in "street name"), you must obtain a legal proxy, executed in your favor, from the record holder of your shares to be able to vote in
person at the special meeting. If you plan to attend the special meeting, you must hold your shares in your own name or have a letter from the record holder of your shares
confirming your ownership. In addition, you must bring a form of personal photo identification with you in order to be admitted to the meeting. The Company reserves
the right to refuse admittance to anyone without proper proof of share ownership or without proper photo identification. Whether or not you intend to be present at the
special meeting, you are urged to sign, date and return your proxy card, or to vote via the Internet or by telephone, promptly. If you are then present and wish to vote your
shares in person, your original proxy may be revoked by voting at the special meeting. 

Q: Can I change my vote? 

A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record of Company common stock, you may change your vote at any time before your shares of Company common stock are voted at the
special meeting by: (i) signing and returning a proxy card with a later date; (ii) attending the special meeting in person, notifying the corporate secretary, and voting by
ballot at the special meeting; (iii) voting by telephone or the Internet at a later time; or (iv) delivering a written revocation letter to the Company's Corporate Secretary at
300 Vesey Street, New York, NY 10282. If you hold your shares in "street name" through a bank, broker or other holder of record, you should contact your record holder
to change your vote. 

Q: Will the Company be required to submit the merger proposal to Company stockholders even if the Company board has withdrawn, modified or qualified its
recommendation? 

A: Yes. Unless the merger agreement is terminated before the special meeting, the Company is required to submit the merger proposal to Company stockholders even if the
Company board has withdrawn or modified its recommendation. 

Q: Is the merger expected to be taxable to U.S. holders? 

A: Yes. The exchange of shares of Company common stock for cash pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. If you are a U.S. holder and you exchange your shares of Company common stock in the merger for cash, you will generally recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and your adjusted tax basis in such shares.

Backup withholding may also apply to the cash payments made pursuant to the merger unless the holder or other payee provides a taxpayer identification number,
certifies that such number is correct and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules. You should read "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger" for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. You should also consult your tax advisor for a
complete analysis of the effect of the merger on your federal, state and local and/or foreign taxes.

Q: Are Company stockholders entitled to dissenters' rights? 

A: Yes. Company stockholders are expected to be entitled to dissenters' rights, or appraisal rights, under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (which we refer to as the "DGCL"). For further information, see "Appraisal Rights." 

Q: If I am a Company stockholder, should I send in my stock certificate(s) now? 

A: No. If the merger proposal is approved, after the completion of the merger, you will promptly be sent a letter of transmittal describing how you may exchange your stock
certificate(s) or book-entry shares of Company common stock for the merger consideration. If your shares of Company common stock are held in "street name" through a
bank, broker or other holder of record, you should contact the record holder of your shares for instructions as to how to effect the surrender of your "street name" shares
of Company common stock in exchange for the merger consideration. Please do NOT return your stock certificate(s) with your proxy. 

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials? 

A: Company stockholders may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction
cards. For example, if you hold shares of Company common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each
brokerage account in which you hold such shares. If you are a stockholder of record of Company common stock and your shares are registered in more than one name,
you will receive more than one proxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive or otherwise follow the
voting instructions set forth in this proxy statement to ensure that you vote every share of Company common stock that you own. 

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed? 

A: The Company currently expects to complete the merger in the third quarter of 2017. However, the Company cannot assure you of when or if the merger will be
completed, and completion is subject to the satisfaction of various conditions that are not within the Company's control. The Company must obtain the approval of
Company stockholders to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. The Company and Virtu must also obtain certain regulatory approvals and satisfy certain
other closing conditions. 

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed? 

A: If the merger is not completed for any reason, Company stockholders will not receive any consideration for their shares of Company common stock in connection with
the merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent, public company and the Company common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. In
addition, under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, the Company may be required to pay a termination fee of $45 million or up to $15 million in
expense reimbursements to Virtu. See "The Merger Agreement—Termination

The Special Meeting (Page 14)

Table of Contents

You will have one vote on each matter properly coming before the special meeting for each share of Company common stock that you owned on the record date.

        Holders of a majority of the shares of Company common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person or represented by
proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting. All shares of Company common stock present in person or represented by proxy,
including abstentions, will be treated as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for all matters voted on at the special meeting.

Vote Required (Page 15)

        Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to
vote on such question. Approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Company common stock
present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on such question. Whether or not a quorum is present, approval of the adjournment proposal
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Company common stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and
entitled to vote on such question.

        If you mark "ABSTAIN" on your proxy card, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal, the compensation proposal and the adjournment
proposal. If you fail to submit a proxy card or vote in person at the special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote
"AGAINST" the merger proposal, but will have no effect on the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.

        As a condition and inducement to the willingness of Virtu to enter into the merger agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement,
Virtu entered into a voting agreement (which we refer to as the "voting agreement") with Jefferies LLC (which we refer to as "Jefferies"), a stockholder of the Company,
which beneficially owned 15,935,031 shares of Company common stock as of the record date, representing approximately 23.4% of the outstanding Company common
stock as of the record date. The voting agreement requires Jefferies, among other things, to vote all shares of Company common stock that Jefferies is entitled to vote in
favor of adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger.

Voting, Proxies and Revocation (Page 16)

        Any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet or by returning the enclosed proxy card in the
accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or may vote in person by appearing at the special meeting.

        If your Company common stock is held in "street name" through a bank, broker or other holder of record, you should instruct the record holder of your shares on how
to vote your Company common stock using the instructions provided by such record holder. "Broker non-votes" are shares held in "street name" by banks, brokers and
other holders of record that are present or represented by proxy at the special meeting, but for which the beneficial owner has not provided the record holder with
instructions on how to vote on a particular proposal that such record holder does not have discretionary voting power on. Because, under applicable rules, banks, brokers
and other holders of record holding shares in "street name" do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy
statement, if a beneficial owner of Company common stock held in "street name" does not give voting instructions to the applicable record holder, then those shares will
not be counted as present in person or by proxy at the special meeting. As the vote to approve the merger proposal is based on the total number of shares of Company
common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date, if you fail to issue voting instructions to your bank, broker or other holder of record, it will have the
same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal

to adopt the merger agreement. Although we do not expect to bring any matters before the meeting other than the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if an
additional matter is brought before the meeting and is one on which brokers have discretionary voting authority and you fail to provide instructions to your broker with
respect to the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal, such broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum and have the same effect
as a vote "AGAINST" such proposals.

        If no instruction as to how to vote is given (including no instruction to abstain from voting) in an executed, duly returned and not revoked proxy, the proxy will be
voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Company board, which, as of the date of this proxy statement, are "FOR" the merger proposal, "FOR" the
compensation proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

        You have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time before it is exercised by submitting a later-dated proxy
through any of the methods available to you, by giving written notice of revocation to the Company's Corporate Secretary, which must be filed with the Corporate
Secretary by 5:00 p.m. on the business day immediately prior to the date of the special meeting, or by attending the special meeting and voting in person. Attending the
special meeting alone, without voting at the special meeting, will not be sufficient to revoke your proxy. Written notice of revocation should be mailed to: KCG
Holdings, Inc., Attn: Corporate Secretary, 300 Vesey Street, New York, NY 10282. If you are a "street name" holder of the Company's common stock, you may change
your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your bank, broker or holder of record. You must contact the record holder of your shares to obtain instructions as to how
to change your proxy vote.

The Merger (Page 20)

        Under the merger agreement, Merger Sub, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Virtu, will merge with and into the Company, so that the Company will be the
surviving entity in the merger and will be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Virtu when the merger is completed.

Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board of Directors (Page 25)

        After careful consideration of various factors described in "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board of Directors," the
Company board has determined that the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and has unanimously
approved the merger agreement and the merger and declared it advisable that the Company enter into the merger agreement.

        The Company board unanimously recommends that Company stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal, "FOR" the compensation proposal and "FOR" the
adjournment proposal.

Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (Page 31 and Annex C)

        Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (formerly known as Goldman, Sachs & Co. and referred to herein as "Goldman Sachs") delivered its opinion to the Company board that,
as of April 20, 2017 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $20.00 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the
holders (other than Virtu and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

        The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated April 20, 2017, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex C. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the
Company board in connection with its consideration of the merger.

Table of Contents

The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Company common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.
Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs, the Company has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of $15,000,000, $4,000,000
of which Goldman Sachs became entitled to receive upon the execution of the engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs and the remainder of which is
contingent upon consummation of the merger.

Financing of the Merger (Page 41)

        Virtu has entered into debt commitment letters and investment agreements in order to secure the financing it needs to consummate the merger. The obligations of
Virtu and Merger Sub to complete the merger are not contingent upon the receipt of any financing.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger (Page 42)

        The interests of the Company's directors and executive officers in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of the Company's stockholders generally
are described below. The Company's board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the
merger, and in recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by Company common stockholders. These interests include (i) the right to receive cash payments in
respect of outstanding RSUs, which will be based on the merger consideration of $20.00 per share, and stock options, which will be based upon the excess, if any, of the
merger consideration of $20.00 per share over the exercise price per share of Company common stock previously subject to such stock option; (ii) the right to receive cash
payments in respect of outstanding Company warrants, which will be based upon the excess, if any, of the merger consideration of $20.00 per share over the then-current
exercise price per share of Company common stock (without giving effect to any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) previously subject to such
Company warrant; (iii) the receipt of severance payments and benefits upon certain qualifying terminations of employment, pursuant to the terms of each executive
officer's respective employment agreement; (iv) the right to receive an annual bonus for the 2017 fiscal year, paid in cash in the event of a qualifying termination occurring
after the completion of the merger; and (v) entitlement to continued indemnification, expense advancement and insurance coverage under the merger agreement.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 45)

        The exchange of Company common stock for cash pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders (as defined in "The Merger—
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Stockholders who are U.S. holders and who exchange their
Company common stock in the merger will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the cash payments made pursuant to the
merger and their adjusted tax basis in their shares. Backup withholding may also apply to the cash payments made pursuant to the merger unless the holder or other payee
provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies that such number is correct and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules. You should read "The Merger—
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" for a definition of "U.S. holder" and a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger. You should also consult your tax advisor for a complete analysis of the effect of the merger on your federal, state and local and/or foreign
taxes.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (Page 47)

        Completion of the merger is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals required to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement from
(i) the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (which we refer to as "FINRA"); (ii) the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority

(which we refer to as the "FCA") and (iii) Finansinspektionen, Sweden's financial supervisory authority (which we refer to as the "FSA"), as well as the expiration of any
waiting periods applicable to the consummation of the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (which we refer to as the
"HSR Act", and we refer to the above approvals as "required governmental approvals").

        Although neither the Company nor Virtu knows of any reason why it cannot obtain the required governmental approvals in a timely manner, the parties cannot be
certain when or if they will be obtained.

Litigation Related to the Merger (Page 48)

        Between May 19 and May 23, 2017, five putative class actions relating to the Merger were filed by shareholders of KCG against KCG and its board of directors in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The cases are captioned Siegal v. KCG Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-3886, Berg v. KCG
Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-3802, Pauza v. KCG Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-3885, Evangelista v. KCG Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-
3959, and Klein v. KCG Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-3946. The Klein and Berg complaints also name as defendants Virtu and Merger Sub. The complaints
assert that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC by KCG in
connection with the Merger.

        All five complaints allege, among other things, that the individual defendants and the Company violated federal securities laws by disseminating a preliminary proxy
that included allegedly material misstatements or omissions about the Merger and the sale process leading up to the Merger. Among other things, the complaints allege that
the preliminary proxy omits or misrepresents material information concerning: (i) the Company management's projections that were utilized by Goldman Sachs, the
Company's financial advisor in connection with the Merger, (ii) the valuation analyses prepared by Goldman Sachs in connection with the rendering of its fairness opinion,
and (iii) the sale process leading up to the Merger. The complaints seek, among other things, (i) an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining the Merger until the
allegedly omitted information is disclosed, (ii) rescission of the Merger or an award of damages in the event the merger is consummated, and (iii) an award of plaintiff's
attorneys' fees and costs. The defendants have not yet answered or otherwise responded to these complaints.

        On May 31, 2017, the parties to these litigations entered into a memorandum of understanding that sets forth an agreement in principle to settle and release all claims
asserted by plaintiffs in the litigations. The settlement is subject to, among other things, the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation.

The Merger Agreement (Page 49 and Annex A)

Merger Consideration (Page 49)

        In the merger, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, except for specified shares held by the Company
or owned by Virtu or Merger Sub and shares of Company common stock held by Company stockholders who properly exercise dissenters' rights, shall be converted into
the right to receive $20.00 in cash without interest.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards (Page 50)

        Stock Options:    At the effective time, each outstanding stock option under the Company stock plan will, automatically and without any required action on the part of
the holder thereof, be cancelled and will entitle the holder of such stock option to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of

(i) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the merger
consideration of $20.00 per share over (y) the exercise price per share of such stock option, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Any
stock option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the merger consideration of $20.00 per share will be cancelled at the effective time for no
consideration or payment.

        SARs:    At the effective time, each outstanding SAR granted under the Company stock plan will, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and will entitle the holder of such SAR to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company common
stock subject to such SAR immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the merger consideration of $20.00 per share over (y) the exercise price
per share of such SAR, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Because all outstanding SARs have an exercise price per share that is
greater than or equal to the merger consideration of $20.00 per share, all SARs will be cancelled at the effective time for no consideration or payment.

        RSUs:    At the effective time, any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding RSU under the Company stock plan, whether vested or unvested, will,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full and each RSU will be cancelled and will entitle the holder of such RSU to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such RSU immediately prior to the effective time and
(y) the merger consideration of $20.00 per share, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

Treatment of Company Warrants (Page 51)

        With respect to each Company warrant outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, the right of the holder of a Company warrant to exercise such Company
warrant to receive shares of Company common stock will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of
Company common stock subject to such Company warrant and (B) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the then-current exercise price per share of
Company common stock (without giving effect to any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) previously subject to such Company warrant, less
applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

Stockholder Meeting and Recommendation of the Company Board of Directors (Page 60)

        The Company has agreed to hold a special meeting as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of voting upon adoption of the merger agreement and upon other
related matters. The Company board has agreed to communicate to its stockholders its recommendation (which we refer to as the "Company recommendation") (and
include such Company recommendation in this proxy statement) that they adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger proposal. However, if (i) the Company
board is presented with an unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal and, after consultation with its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors, determines in good faith that such unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a superior company
proposal (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers"), or (ii) other than in connection with an unsolicited bona fide written takeover
proposal, an event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that affects the business, assets or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries that is unknown to the
Company board as of the date of the merger agreement becomes known to the Company board, then it may make a Company adverse recommendation change and, in each
case, the Company board concludes in good faith, following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to make a Company

Table of Contents

adverse recommendation change (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—Stockholder Meeting and Recommendation of the Company Board of Directors") is reasonably
likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the Company stockholders provided that:

• the Company gives Virtu at least five business days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action and certain information about the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action; and 

• the Company board takes into account any changes to the merger agreement committed to in writing by Virtu (which shall be negotiated in good faith by
the Company) that (i) in the event of a superior company proposal, result in a transaction that is no less favorable to the Company stockholders than any
superior company proposal in the absence of such changes or (ii) in the event of an unknown and not reasonably foreseeable intervening event, the
Company board would no longer be required to make a Company adverse recommendation change in order not to be reasonably likely to violate its
fiduciary duties to the Company stockholders.

        Unless the merger agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company is required to hold the special meeting for the purpose of voting upon
the merger proposal even if there is a change in Company recommendation.

Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers (Page 62)

        The merger agreement provides that the Company will not, and will cause its affiliates and its and their respective affiliates and representatives not to, directly or
indirectly:

• solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate (including by way of providing information) any takeover proposal (as defined in "The
Merger Agreement—Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers") or any inquiry or proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to result in a
takeover proposal; 

• participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or cooperate in any way
with any person (whether or not a person making a takeover proposal) with respect to any takeover proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably
be expected to result in a takeover proposal; 

• approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any takeover proposal; 

• approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, asset or share purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any
takeover proposal; 

• enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by, or
breach its obligations under, the merger agreement; or 

• propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

        Notwithstanding these restrictions, under certain circumstances, and to the extent that the Company board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, that a takeover proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a superior company proposal, the
Company may, prior to the time the merger agreement is adopted by the Company stockholders, make available non-public information or data, and participate in
negotiations or discussions, with respect to certain unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposals.

Table of Contents

Conditions to Complete the Merger (Page 63)

        The respective obligations of the Company, Virtu and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions,
including the adoption of the merger agreement by the Company's stockholders, the receipt of the required governmental approvals, the absence of any legal prohibitions
preventing the consummation of the merger, the distribution by Virtu of an information statement regarding the approval of the equity financing (as defined in "The Merger
—Financing of the Merger") by its stockholders, the accuracy of the representations and warranties (subject to customary materiality qualifiers) and compliance by the
other party with its obligations under the merger agreement (subject to customary materiality qualifiers). In addition, Virtu and Merger Sub will not be obligated to
complete the merger if there has been a material adverse effect with respect to the Company (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties")
since the date of the merger agreement.

        Neither the Company nor Virtu can be certain when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived, or that the merger will be completed.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (Page 64)

        The merger agreement can be terminated at any time prior to completion of the merger (whether before or after the adoption of the merger agreement by Company
stockholders (unless otherwise specified below)) in the following circumstances:

• by the mutual written consent of Virtu and the Company; 

• by either Virtu or the Company if: 

• the merger has not been completed on or before January 31, 2018, except that, if the failure of the merger to be consummated by that date is
primarily due to the breach by the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in the merger agreement, such party shall not be permitted to terminate the merger agreement; 

• any injunction permanently restrains, enjoins or prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the merger, and such injunction becomes effective
(and final and nonappealable) or any law becomes enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any governmental authority that prohibits or makes
illegal consummation of the merger; 

• Company stockholders do not approve the merger proposal; 

• by the Company, (i) if there has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Virtu or Merger Sub contained
in the merger agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition to the Company's obligation to complete the merger and which is not
curable or cured within the earlier of thirty (30) days and January 31, 2018, and (ii) the Company is not then in breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement such that it would give rise to the failure of a condition to Merger Sub's obligation to complete
the merger; 

• by Virtu, (i) if there has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company contained in the merger
agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition to Virtu's obligation to complete the merger and which is not curable or cured within
the earlier of thirty (30) days and January 31, 2018, and (ii) Virtu is not then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
the merger agreement such that it would give rise to the failure of a condition precedent to the Company's obligation to complete the merger;

• by Virtu if, prior to obtaining the approval of Company stockholders of the merger proposal: 

• the Company board fails to recommend to the Company stockholders that they approve the merger proposal, or effects a Company adverse
recommendation change; or 

• the Company or the Company board has materially breached its obligations with respect to obtaining stockholder approval or not soliciting other
offers in a manner adverse to Virtu.

Termination Fee (Page 65)

        The Company will pay Virtu a termination fee in the amount of $45 million if the merger agreement is terminated in the following circumstances:

• prior to obtaining the approval of Company stockholders of the merger proposal, Virtu terminates the merger agreement because the Company board fails
to recommend to the Company stockholders that they approve the merger proposal or effects a Company adverse recommendation change; 

• prior to obtaining the approval of Company stockholders of the merger proposal, Virtu terminates the merger agreement because the Company or the
Company board has materially breached its obligations with respect to obtaining stockholder approval or not soliciting other offers in a manner adverse to
Virtu; and 

• prior to the Company stockholder meeting, (i) a Company takeover proposal is publicly made or otherwise communicated in writing to the Company's
senior management or the Company board and not expressly withdrawn, and (ii) the merger agreement is terminated because (x) the Company stockholders
fail to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting, (y) a material breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the Company
results in the failure of a condition to Virtu's obligation to complete the merger and Virtu elects not to complete the merger or (z) the merger is not
completed by January 31, 2018 and, in the case of (y) and (z), the approval of Company stockholders of the merger proposal has not been obtained at the
time of such termination, and (iii) within 12 months of the termination of the merger agreement, the Company consummates a transaction (or enters into a
definitive agreement to do so) with respect to a takeover proposal, provided that, for purposes of the foregoing, all references in the definition of takeover
proposal to "20%" will instead refer to "50%".

        The Company will pay Virtu an amount equal to that required to reimburse Virtu and its affiliates for all of their documented out-of-pocket expenses in an amount not
to exceed $15 million (and which will be credited against any termination fee owed in the event that Virtu would be entitled to both the termination fee and expense
reimbursement) if the merger agreement is terminated by Virtu or the Company because the Company stockholder approval is not obtained at the Company stockholder
meeting duly convened.

        Any termination fee that becomes due must be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds (i) under the circumstances described in the first or second bullet above, on the
business day immediately following the date of termination of the merger agreement and (ii) under the circumstances described in the third bullet above, on the date of the
first to occur of the events described in clause (iii) of that bullet.

        In the event that the termination fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to the merger agreement, the termination fee will be Virtu's and Merger
Sub's sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

Expenses and Fees (Page 66)

        Unless a specific term of the merger agreement provides for a different arrangement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement will be
paid by the party incurring such expense, whether or not the merger is consummated, except that expenses incurred in connection with printing and mailing of this proxy
statement and in connection with notices or other filings with any governmental authorities under any laws shall be shared equally by Virtu and the Company.

Specific Performance (Page 66)

        Each of the parties is entitled to specific performance of the terms of the merger agreement, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the merger
agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the merger agreement (including the obligation to consummate the merger) in addition to any other
remedy such party is entitled at law or in equity.

Voting Agreement (Page 68 and Annex B)

        As a condition and inducement to the willingness of Virtu to enter into the merger agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement,
Virtu entered into a voting agreement with Jefferies, which beneficially owned approximately 23.4% of the outstanding Company common stock as of the record date. The
voting agreement, which is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement, among other things, (i) requires Jefferies to vote all shares of Company common stock that
Jefferies is entitled to vote in favor of adoption or approval, as applicable, of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, and of
certain related matters, and against certain actions and alternative transactions; and (ii) generally prohibits Jefferies from entering into agreements regarding or transferring
its shares, subject to certain exceptions, prior to the termination of the voting agreement. The voting agreement will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the effective
time of the merger and (ii) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms. Jefferies will also have the right to terminate its voting agreement if the
terms of the merger agreement are amended to reduce the consideration payable to Jefferies or otherwise materially and adversely impact Jefferies, and Virtu will also have
the right to terminate the voting agreement by written notice to Jefferies. See "Voting Agreement" and "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
Management."

Appraisal Rights (Page 70 and Annex D)

        If the merger agreement is adopted by Company stockholders, Company stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement will be
entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL if they properly demand appraisal of their shares and meet certain other
conditions and statutory requirements described herein. This means that Company stockholders are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the "fair value" of their shares of Company common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger, together with interest (unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) to be paid upon the amount
determined by the Court of Chancery to be "fair value" from the effective time through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time and the date of payment of the judgment (provided
that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding the surviving corporation pays to each Company stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash,
interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court of
Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time), so long as they comply with the procedures,

Table of Contents

and subject to the conditions, set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. For further information, see "Appraisal Rights—Determination of Fair Value."

        Company stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of
appraisal rights, due to the complexity of the appraisal process.

        Company stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the "fair value" of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could
be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares. To exercise
your appraisal rights, (i) you must submit a written demand for appraisal to the Company before the stockholder vote is taken on the merger proposal at the special
meeting; (ii) you must not submit a blank proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the merger proposal and (iii) you must hold shares of Company common stock of record
when you submit your written demand for appraisal and continue to hold them through the effective time of the merger.

        Your failure to follow the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights
are described in further detail in "Appraisal Rights," and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as Annex D to this proxy
statement. If you hold your shares of Company common stock through a bank, broker or other holder of record and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should
consult with the record holder of your shares to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such record holder.

Market Price and Dividends (Page 79)

        In the merger, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, except for specified shares held by the Company
or owned by Virtu or Merger Sub and shares of Company common stock held by Company stockholders who properly exercise dissenters' rights, shall be converted into
the right to receive $20.00 in cash without interest. The merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 12.7% over $17.74, the closing price of Company
common stock on the NYSE on April 19, 2017, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger agreement, and a premium of approximately 45.7%
over $13.73, the closing price of Company common stock on the NYSE on March 14, 2017, the last trading day prior to the date on which a news organization reported
publicly that Virtu had made an offer to purchase the Company.

        On May 31, 2017, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was mailed to our stockholders, the closing price for Company common stock on the
NYSE was $19.86 per share. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for Company common stock in connection with voting your shares.

Delisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock (Page 82)

        If the merger is completed, Company common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which
we refer to as the "Exchange Act"), and the Company will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

        This proxy statement contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is intended to be protected
by the safe harbor provided therein. We generally identify forward-looking statements, particularly those statements regarding the benefits of the proposed merger between Virtu
and the Company, the anticipated timing of the transaction and the products and markets of each company, by terminology such as "outlook," "believes," "expects," "potential,"
"continues," "may," "will," "would," "could," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "predicts," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "anticipates," "projects," "strategy," "future,"
"opportunity," "will likely result" or the negative version of those words or other comparable words. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on
current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are
inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, you are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to
certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.

        A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements in this proxy statement, including, but
not limited to:

• the merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect the Company's business and the price of Company common stock; 

• the Company stockholders may fail to approve the merger proposal; 

• required governmental approvals may not be obtained or may not be obtained on the terms expected or on the anticipated schedule; 

• the parties to the merger agreement may fail to satisfy other conditions to the completion of the merger, or may not be able to meet expectations regarding the
timing and completion of the merger; 

• the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement and the risk that the Company may be
required to pay a termination fee of $45 million to Virtu or reimburse certain expenses in the event that the merger agreement is terminated; 

• the effect of the announcement or pendency of the merger on the Company's business relationships, operating results and business generally; 

• changes in circumstances between the signing of the merger agreement and the completion of the merger, which will not be reflected in the opinion obtained by
the Company from its financial advisor; 

• the inability of the Company to maintain relationships with customers, counterparties and key employees; 

• general economic or market conditions and the impact of changes in regulation applicable to the Company and to political instability generally; 

• risks that the proposed merger disrupts current plans and operations of the Company and potential difficulties in the Company employee retention as a result of the
announcement of the merger; 

• risks related to diverting management's attention from the Company's ongoing business operations; 

• Virtu may fail to obtain the financing it needs to complete the merger; and

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        This section contains information for Company stockholders about the special meeting that the Company has called to allow Company stockholders to consider and vote on
the merger proposal and other matters. The Company is mailing this proxy statement to you, as a Company stockholder, on or about June 1, 2017. This proxy statement is
accompanied by a notice of the special meeting and a form of proxy card that the Company board is soliciting for the Company at the special meeting and at any adjournments
or postponements thereof.

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting 

        This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Company board from Company stockholders for use at the special
meeting to be held on July 12, 2017, at 1:00 p.m., local time, at our principal executive offices, which are located at 300 Vesey Street, New York, New York 10282, or at any
postponement or adjournment thereof.

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon the following matters:

• The merger proposal (Proposal 1 on your proxy card); 

• The compensation proposal (Proposal 2 on your proxy card); and 

• The adjournment proposal (Proposal 3 on your proxy card).

Recommendation of the Company Board of Directors 

        The Company's board of directors has determined that the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders and has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and declared it advisable that the Company enter into the merger agreement. The
Company board unanimously recommends that Company stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal, "FOR" the compensation proposal and "FOR" the adjournment
proposal. See "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board of Directors" for a more detailed discussion of the Company board's
recommendation.

Record Date and Quorum 

        The Company board has fixed the close of business on May 24, 2017 as the record date for the determination of Company stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at,
the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 68,055,342 shares of Company common stock (including certain RSUs) outstanding and entitled to
vote, held by approximately 142 holders of record. You will have one vote on each matter properly coming before the special meeting for each share of Company common stock
that you owned on the record date.

        Holders of a majority of the shares of Company common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy,
will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting. All shares of Company common stock present in person or represented by proxy, including
abstentions, will be treated as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for all matters voted on at the special meeting. Because, under applicable
rules, banks, brokers and other holders of record holding shares in "street name" do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in
this proxy statement, if a beneficial owner of Company common stock held in "street name" does not give voting instructions to the record holder of its, his or her shares, then
those shares will not be

Shares Subject to Voting Agreement

        As a condition and inducement to the willingness of Virtu to enter into the merger agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, Virtu
entered into a voting agreement with Jefferies, which beneficially owned 15,935,031 shares of Company common stock as of the record date, representing approximately 23.4%
of the outstanding Company common stock as of the record date. The voting agreement requires Jefferies to, among other things, vote all shares of Company common stock that
Jefferies is entitled to vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. See "Voting

Voting, Proxies and Revocation 

Attending the Special Meeting

        All Company stockholders, including stockholders of record and stockholders who hold their shares through banks, brokers or other holders of record, are invited to attend
the special meeting. Stockholders of record can vote in person at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record, you must obtain a legal proxy executed in your favor
from the record holder of your shares to be able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you plan to attend the special meeting, you must hold your shares in your own name or
have a letter from the record holder of your shares confirming your ownership. In addition, you must bring a form of personal photo identification with you in order to be
admitted to the meeting. The Company reserves the right to refuse admittance to anyone without proper proof of share ownership or without proper photo identification.

Voting by Stockholders of Record

        If you are a stockholder of record, you may have your shares of Company common stock voted on matters presented at the special meeting in any of the following ways:

• by proxy—stockholders of record have a choice of submitting a proxy: 

• by telephone or over the Internet, by accessing the telephone number or website specified on the enclosed proxy card; 

• by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope; or 

• in person—you may attend the special meeting and cast your vote there.

Voting of Shares Held in "Street Name"; Broker Non-Votes

        If you are a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock held in "street name," you should receive instructions from your bank, broker or other holder of record
that you must follow in order to have your shares of Company common stock voted. Those instructions will identify which of the above choices are available to you in order to
have your shares of Company common stock voted. If you have not received such voting instructions or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact
your broker. If your bank, broker or other holder of record holds your shares of Company common stock in "street name," such record holder will vote your shares of Company
common stock only if you provide instructions on how to vote by filling out the voter instruction form sent to you by such record holder with this proxy statement. Please note
that, if you are a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock held in "street name" and wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you must provide a legal proxy
executed in your favor from your bank, broker or other holder of record at the special meeting.

        Under stock exchange rules, banks, brokers and other holders of record who hold shares of Company common stock in "street name" for a beneficial owner of those shares
typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on "routine" proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, such record holders are
not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to the approval of matters determined to be "non-routine." "Broker non-votes" are shares held in "street name" by
banks, brokers and other holders of record that are present or represented by proxy at the special meeting, but for which the beneficial owner has not provided the record holder
with instructions on how to vote on a particular proposal that such record holder does not have discretionary voting power on. Because, under applicable rules, banks, brokers and
other holders of record holding shares in "street name" do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if a
beneficial owner of

Table of Contents

Company common stock held in "street name" does not give voting instructions to the applicable record holder, then those shares will not be counted as present in person or by
proxy at the special meeting. As the vote to approve the merger proposal is based on the total number of shares of Company common stock outstanding at the close of business
on the record date, if you fail to issue voting instructions to your bank, broker or other holder of record, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement. Although we do not expect to bring any matters before the meeting other than the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if an additional matter
is brought before the meeting and is one on which brokers have discretionary voting authority and you fail to provide instructions to your broker with respect to the compensation
proposal or the adjournment proposal, such broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum and have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" such
proposals.

Voting of Proxies; Incomplete Proxies

        If you submit a proxy, regardless of the method you choose to submit such proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, and each of them, with full power of
substitution, will vote your shares of Company common stock in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone processes or the proxy card, you may
specify whether your shares of Company common stock should be voted for or against, or may choose to abstain from voting, on all, some or none of the specific items of
business to come before the special meeting.

        All shares represented by valid proxies that the Company receives through this solicitation, and that are not revoked, will be voted in accordance with your instructions on
the proxy card. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares of Company common stock should be voted on a matter, the shares of
Company common stock represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Company board, which, as of the date of this
proxy statement, are "FOR" the merger proposal, "FOR" the compensation proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

Deadline to Vote by Proxy

        Please refer to the instructions on your proxy or voting instruction card to determine the deadlines for submitting your proxy over the Internet or by telephone. If you choose
to submit a proxy by mailing a proxy card, your proxy card should be mailed in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope and must be filed with our Corporate Secretary by the
time the special meeting begins.

Revocation of Proxy

        If you are a stockholder of record of your shares of the Company's common stock, you have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or
by mail, at any time before the special meeting, by submitting a later-dated proxy through any of the methods available to you, by giving written notice of revocation to the
Company's Corporate Secretary, which must be filed with the Corporate Secretary by 5:00 p.m. on the business day immediately prior to the date of the special meeting, or by
attending the special meeting and voting in person. Attending the special meeting alone, without voting at the special meeting, will not be sufficient to revoke your proxy. Written
notice of revocation should be mailed to: KCG Holdings, Inc., Attn: Corporate Secretary, 300 Vesey Street, New York, NY 10282.

        If you are a "street name" holder of the Company's common stock, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your bank, broker or other holder of
record. You must contact the record holder of your shares to obtain instructions as to how to change your proxy vote.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        The Company is soliciting your proxy in conjunction with the merger. The Company will bear the cost of soliciting proxies from you. In addition to solicitation of proxies
by mail, the Company will request that banks, brokers and other record holders send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of Company common stock and secure
their voting instructions. The Company has also made arrangements with Okapi Partners LLC to assist it in soliciting proxies and has agreed to pay Okapi Partners LLC
approximately $8,500 plus reasonable expenses for these services.

Delivery of Proxy Materials to Stockholders Sharing an Address 

        As permitted by the Exchange Act, only one copy of this proxy statement is being delivered to multiple Company stockholders sharing an address, unless the Company has
previously received contrary instructions from one or more such stockholders. This is referred to as "householding." Stockholders who hold their shares in "street name" can
request further information on householding through their banks, brokers or other holders of record. On written or oral request to the Company's proxy solicitor, Okapi
Partners LLC, at 1212 Avenue of the Americas, 24th Floor New York, New York 10036, or toll-free at (855) 208-8903 or direct at (212) 297-0720, or by email

THE MERGER 

        This discussion of the merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. You should read the
entire merger agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the merger.

Terms of the Merger 

        Each of the Company's and Virtu's respective boards of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger. Under the merger agreement, Merger
Sub, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Virtu, will merge with and into the Company, so that the Company will be the surviving entity in the merger and will be an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Virtu when the merger is completed.

        In the merger, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, except for specified shares held by the Company or
owned by Virtu or Merger Sub and shares of Company common stock held by Company stockholders who properly exercise dissenters' rights, shall be converted into the right to
receive $20.00 in cash without interest. For a discussion of the treatment of awards outstanding under the Company stock plan as of the effective time and the treatment of
Company warrants outstanding as of the effective time, see "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Company Equity Awards" and "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of
Company Warrants," respectively.

        Company stockholders are being asked to adopt the merger agreement. See "The Merger Agreement" for additional and more detailed information regarding the legal
documents that govern the merger, including information about conditions to the completion of the merger and provisions for terminating or amending the merger agreement.

Background of the Merger 

        Jefferies is the Company's largest shareholder, with beneficial ownership of approximately 24.5% of the outstanding Company common stock at the time that the Company
and Virtu entered into the merger agreement. Jefferies does not have a representative on the Company board. On February 21, 2017, Richard Handler, the chief executive officer
and chairman of Jefferies, met with Daniel Coleman, the chief executive officer of the Company, and advised him of Virtu's interest in acquiring the Company, and that Virtu
would be making a formal offer.

        In December 2016 and again in mid-February 2017, representatives of Virtu had indicated to Mr. Handler Virtu's possible interest in the Company in a series of
conversations initiated by representatives of Virtu. Jefferies informed the Company that, during these conversations, a representative of Virtu communicated to Mr. Handler
preliminary ranges of prices per share at which Virtu might consider making a proposal to acquire the Company, and the Company has been informed by Jefferies that, on each
occasion, Mr. Handler indicated to Virtu that he could not speak for the Company. In addition, Jefferies informed the Company that, on February 14, 2017, at Mr. Handler's
suggestion, a managing director in investment banking at Jefferies met with Douglas Cifu, Virtu's chief executive officer, Joseph Molluso, Virtu's chief financial officer, and other
Virtu representatives to discuss the Company.

        On February 23, 2017, Mr. Cifu, on behalf of Virtu, delivered to Mr. Coleman, on behalf of the Company, a written proposal to acquire the Company through a merger
transaction at a price in the range of $18.50 to $20.00 per share in cash. The closing price of the Company common stock on the NYSE on February 23, 2017 was $14.31.

        On February 24, 2017, Mr. Coleman sent a response to Mr. Cifu confirming receipt of the proposal and stating that the Company board would review the proposal and
consider next steps.

Table of Contents

        On February 26, 2017, the Company board convened to discuss the proposal from Virtu and to consider other strategic opportunities that might be available to the Company.
Representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP ("Sullivan & Cromwell"), the Company's legal advisor, also attended the meeting. At the meeting, Mr. Coleman introduced to the
Company board a proposed plan to restructure certain aspects of the Company's business and return capital to its shareholders without pursuing a merger or sale of the Company
(which we refer to as the "Restructuring Plan") and explained that the Company's management had been working on the Restructuring Plan for several months and that the offer
had caused management to accelerate its thinking about the timing of any restructuring. He recommended that the Company board hire an independent financial advisor to advise
the Company in connection with considering its strategic alternatives, including a transaction with Virtu. To facilitate that objective, the Company board established a sub-
committee to meet with potential independent financial advisors and appointed directors James Milde (chair), Rene Kern, Heather Tookes and Alastair Rampell as its members.
The sub-committee had an informal meeting on March 1, 2017 to discuss potential financial advisors for the sub-committee to interview.

        On March 6, 2017, members of the sub-committee, along with representatives of the Company's management team and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell, met with
two possible financial advisors, including Goldman Sachs, to discuss a potential engagement. Later on March 6, 2017, the committee decided to recommend to the Company
board that it engage Goldman Sachs to serve as the independent financial advisor to the Company board.

        On March 7, 2017, Mr. Handler and other representatives of Jefferies spoke to Mr. Coleman about the Virtu offer. Mr. Handler encouraged the Company to engage with
Virtu.

        On March 10, 2017, the Company board met with the Company's management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Sullivan & Cromwell. Mr. Coleman provided an
update on his communications with Mr. Cifu since the February 26, 2017 board meeting and presented to the Company board additional information about the Restructuring
Plan. Representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell provided an outline of the Company board's fiduciary duties and legal considerations, including standards established under
Delaware law for a transaction of this sort, related to the Virtu proposal. Goldman Sachs presented to the Company board a proposed near term action plan and list of
considerations for a response to Virtu and its preliminary financial analysis of the Virtu bid and Virtu's ability to finance the transaction and shareholder considerations. At this
meeting, the Company board determined to postpone any formal response to Virtu until after its next meeting on March 15, 2017 when the Restructuring Plan would be discussed
in greater detail.

        On March 14, 2017, Mr. Coleman met with Mr. Handler who reiterated to Mr. Coleman Jefferies' view that the Company should engage in discussions with Virtu regarding
its proposal. On the same day, Charles E. Haldeman, the chairman of the Company board, spoke to Brian Friedman, the chairman of the executive committee of Jefferies, who
reaffirmed Jefferies' view that the Company should engage in discussions with Virtu regarding its proposal.

        On March 15, 2017, the Company board met with the Company's management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Sullivan & Cromwell. Investment banking
personnel from Jefferies, who had assisted the Company in developing the Restructuring Plan, attended the initial part of the meeting where the Restructuring Plan was discussed.
Mr. Coleman presented the Restructuring Plan to the Company board. Representatives of Goldman Sachs presented a preliminary financial analysis of the Company, including
analysis using the Restructuring Plan, and a preliminary financial analysis of the Virtu proposal, and provided an update on the transaction process and a preliminary list of other
potential strategic buyers.

        Later on March 15, 2017, various news outlets including The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires published articles disclosing that Virtu had made an unsolicited
offer to purchase the Company. On the day of the publication of The Wall Street Journal article, the Company's stock price

rose from $13.73 when markets opened to $16.90 when NYSE suspended trading in the stock prior to the market closing.

        Later in the day on March 15, 2017, Mr. Coleman sent a letter to Mr. Cifu responding to the initial Virtu proposal. Mr. Coleman informed Mr. Cifu that the Company board
had been actively considering the Virtu proposal and offered to meet with Mr. Cifu to discuss the proposal and possible next steps. He asked Mr. Cifu whether Virtu was prepared
to increase its offer price, and requested that Mr. Cifu provide additional detail on key execution risks related to the proposed transaction, in particular the financing, and outline
Virtu's plans with respect to retention of Company employees and Virtu's plans for financing the merger. On the same day, the Company issued a press release confirming that it
had received an unsolicited proposal from Virtu to acquire all of the outstanding Company common stock for $18.50 to $20.00 per share in cash.

        On March 16, 2017, Virtu issued a press release confirming that it had made an offer to acquire the Company.

        Later in the day on March 16, 2017, Mr. Cifu sent a letter to Mr. Coleman responding to Mr. Coleman's March 15 letter. Mr. Cifu affirmed the price range of $18.50 to
$20.00, and affirmed that Virtu did not expect to have a financing condition at the time of signing a definitive agreement and had had preliminary conversations with J.P. Morgan
regarding debt financing for a possible transaction with the Company. He asserted that a preliminary evaluation by counsel indicated that required regulatory approvals, including
antitrust approval, would not present an obstacle to a possible transaction. Finally, he indicated that Virtu would be willing to enter into a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA,
including a standstill agreement with the Company in order to commence its diligence process and appended a draft NDA to his letter.

        Also on March 16, 2017, a party, which we refer to as Party A, that had apparently learned about the transaction from the press coverage of Virtu's proposal, contacted
Mr. Coleman to inform him that it was interested in exploring a strategic combination with the Company.

        On March 17, 2017, the Company and Virtu entered into an NDA. Virtu sent the Company a list of requested materials and information about the Company and proposed a
series of meetings among members of the management teams of Virtu and the Company.

        On March 20, 2017, the Company board met to receive an update on the process, including a description of the inbound interest from Party A and information about the
Virtu proposal.

        Representatives of Virtu received access to the Company's data room on March 20, 2017. Between March 21 and April 5, 2017, representatives of Virtu, J.P. Morgan and
Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Virtu's financial advisors, together with Virtu's financial, accounting and legal advisors, attended numerous management due diligence sessions
with representatives of the Company and its advisors.

        On March 22, 2017, the Company entered into an NDA including a standstill agreement without a provision restricting waiver requests with Party A. Party A received
access to the Company's data room on the same day. Party A attended management diligence sessions with members of the Company's management team on March 23, 2017.

        Although the Company did receive limited inquiries from parties indicating preliminary interest in acquiring immaterial assets or businesses of the Company, Party A was
the only party to contact the Company or its advisors regarding an acquisition of the Company after the March 15 Wall Street Journal article and subsequent press releases from
the Company and Virtu. On March 23, 2017, following discussions with Mr. Coleman, representatives of Goldman Sachs and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell,
Mr. Haldeman contacted the members of the Company board to recommend that Goldman Sachs, on the Company's behalf, reach out to other possible bidders for the Company
initially

identified by Goldman Sachs and approved by Mr. Haldeman and the Company's management. The board members approved his recommendation.

        On March 24, 2017, Party A informed Mr. Coleman that it was no longer interested in pursuing a possible transaction with the Company.

        On March 24 and 26, 2017, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to discuss Virtu's ongoing due diligence process and certain matters
related to Virtu's evaluation of the Company. On March 26, 2017, pursuant to instructions from the Company, Goldman Sachs requested that Virtu deliver to the Company no
later than April 3, 2017 its best and final offer, including a draft merger agreement, draft financing commitment agreements with Virtu's committed financing counterparties, a
summary statement of the sources and uses of financing Virtu intended to use to acquire the Company and a list of final due diligence items. Goldman Sachs, at the Company's
request, advised J.P. Morgan that, if the Company board approved Virtu's revised offer, the Company would seek to sign a definitive merger agreement and announce the
transaction with Virtu no later than April 20, 2017, the date of the Company's first quarter earnings announcement.

        On March 27, 2017, pursuant to instructions from the Company, Goldman Sachs began to contact other possible bidders.

        On March 29, 2017, the Company board received an update from representatives of Goldman Sachs on their outreach to other possible bidders and to discuss other matters
related to a possible transaction with Virtu. Goldman Sachs reported that it had contacted six possible bidders and that one, which we refer to as Party B, had expressed interest in
receiving more information about the Company. The remainder indicated that they were not interested in a transaction with the Company.

        On March 29, 2017, Mr. Cifu, on behalf of Virtu, sent Mr. Coleman a letter advising him of the significant progress made by Virtu in its due diligence process and thanking
the Company's management team for its thorough commitment to the diligence process to date. He highlighted certain open diligence matters and proposed that Virtu would
deliver a revised offer price, draft transaction documents and a draft commitment letter from J.P. Morgan with respect to the financing of a possible acquisition of the Company
by Virtu no later than April 10, 2017.

        On March 30, 2017, in a letter from Mr. Coleman to Mr. Cifu, the Company agreed to Virtu's proposed timeline for a revised offer and draft documentation.

        Party B withdrew its interest in pursuing an acquisition of the Company on March 31, 2017 prior to entering into an NDA.

        On April 4, 2017, the sub-committee of the board met to discuss the terms of the proposed engagement letter with Goldman Sachs. Members of management also attended.

        On April 10, 2017, Virtu sent the Company and its representatives draft transaction agreements, including a draft merger agreement, draft debt financing commitment letter
from J.P. Morgan and a draft voting agreement between Jefferies and Virtu, and a revised proposal to acquire the Company for $18.50 a share in an all cash transaction. The
Company board scheduled a meeting for the afternoon of April 11, 2017 to discuss Virtu's revised bid.

        Prior to the April 11, 2017 board meeting, a representative of J.P. Morgan communicated to a representative of Goldman Sachs, and representatives of Jefferies
communicated to both Mr. Haldeman and Mr. Coleman, their belief that $18.50 per share was not necessarily Virtu's best and final offer and that Virtu could be willing to offer a
higher price for the Company.

        At its April 11, 2017 meeting, the Company board rejected Virtu's revised proposal to acquire the Company for $18.50 per share, but decided to ask Virtu for what would be
considered by the Company board as Virtu's best and final offer. Representatives of Goldman Sachs presented a preliminary

financial analysis of the Company, including analysis using the proposed Restructuring Plan. Representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell presented with respect to various legal
matters.

        On April 12, 2017, the Company received a revised bid from Virtu to acquire the Company in an all cash transaction for $20.00 per share.

        At a meeting on April 12, 2017, the Company board discussed Virtu's revised proposal. The Company board agreed to respond to Virtu's April 12 proposal with a counter-
offer for a purchase price of $20.21 per share, the book value per share of the Company as at March 31, 2017. The Company board also discussed, with representatives of
Sullivan & Cromwell and Goldman Sachs and management, several contractual points related to reducing regulatory risk, retaining employees in the period between signing an
agreement and completing a transaction with Virtu and seeking to ensure a high degree of certainty that the transaction would be completed if the Company entered into an
agreement with Virtu. The Company board determined that Goldman Sachs would convey its response to the Virtu April 12 proposal in a discussion with J.P. Morgan that
evening.

        On April 15, 2017, Sullivan & Cromwell sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP ("Paul Weiss"), counsel to Virtu. On
April 16, 2017, Sullivan & Cromwell sent additional revisions of the draft of the merger agreement to Paul Weiss. Later in the day on April 16, 2017, Paul Weiss sent a revised
draft of the agreement to Sullivan & Cromwell.

        The Company board, with members of the Company's management and representatives from Goldman Sachs and Sullivan & Cromwell, convened on April 17, 2017 to
discuss the status of the proposed transaction with Virtu. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reported that J.P. Morgan had informed Goldman Sachs that, after considering the
Company's counter-proposal of $20.21 per share, Virtu was unwilling to increase its offer per share above $20.00 and that Virtu had $750 million of committed equity financing
and that J.P. Morgan would provide the remainder of the financing, which would be borrowings, that Virtu required to acquire the Company. Representatives of Sullivan &
Cromwell provided an update on the status of the negotiation of the merger agreement with Paul Weiss.

        The Company board met again, with members of the Company's management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Sullivan & Cromwell, on the morning of April 19,
2017 to discuss the progress towards a final merger agreement with Virtu. The Company board instructed its advisors to attempt to finalize all transaction documentation in order
for the Company to be in a position to sign the merger agreement and announce the acquisition of the Company by Virtu on April 20 in connection with the Company's earnings
announcement. Understanding that Virtu had refused to increase its offer price above $20.00 per share, the Company board tentatively agreed to a purchase price equal to $20.00
a share, subject to receipt of a fairness opinion from Goldman Sachs, satisfactory resolution of open points on the merger agreement and delivery of final committed financing
documents.

        On April 19, 2017, acting by written consent, the Company board unanimously approved the Forecasts (as defined in "The Merger—Opinion of the Company's Financial
Advisor") of the Company used in connection with the Restructuring Plan, but not the execution of the Restructuring Plan, and the use of such Forecasts in the financial analysis
by Goldman Sachs of the transaction with Virtu.

        Following the Company board meeting on April 19, 2017 and through the morning of April 20, 2017, representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Paul Weiss continued to
negotiate and finalize the terms of the draft merger agreement.

        On the morning of April 20, 2017, the Company board convened, with members of the Company's management and representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell and Goldman
Sachs, to discuss updates since the April 19 board meeting and the negotiation of the definitive documentation. Goldman Sachs then presented to the Company board its financial
analyses with respect to the Company and the proposed

transaction with Virtu. Thereafter, at the request of the Company board, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion to the Company board (which was subsequently confirmed in
writing by delivery of Goldman Sachs' written opinion to the Company board dated the same date) to the effect that, as of April 20, 2017, and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to the
holders (other than Virtu and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Sullivan & Cromwell provided a summary of the terms of the merger agreement and gave a further presentation describing the fiduciary duties of the directors in approving the
Company entering into the merger agreement.

        Following the rendering of Goldman Sachs' opinion, and extensive review and discussions among the members of the Company board, including consideration of the factors
described under "—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board", the Company board, with all members present and voting, unanimously determined that
the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger
and declared it advisable that the Company enter into the merger agreement. The Company board further resolved unanimously to recommend approval and adoption by the
Company stockholders of the merger agreement, the merger and such other matters that are submitted for their approval in connection with the merger agreement. The Company
board then directed Company management to execute a definitive merger agreement on substantially the terms reviewed at the board meeting, and directed that the merger
agreement be submitted to the Company stockholders for approval.

        At the same time that the Company entered into the merger agreement, at the request of Virtu, Jefferies entered into a voting agreement with Virtu pursuant to which it
agreed to vote all of the shares of the Company common stock that it is entitled to vote in favor of the merger agreement proposal.

        On the morning of April 20, 2017, Virtu and the Company each issued a press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement.

Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board of Directors 

        In determining that the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the Company stockholders, approving the merger
agreement and the merger and declaring it advisable that the Company enter into the merger agreement, and recommending approval and adoption by the Company stockholders
of the merger agreement, the merger and any other matters submitted for their approval in connection with the merger agreement, the Company board consulted with Company
management, as well as its financial and legal advisors, and considered numerous factors, including the following material factors:

• the value to be received by the stockholders in the merger, including the fact that the cash consideration to be received by the stockholders represented a
significant premium relative to the trading price of Company common stock prior to the public announcement of the Virtu offer, and a premium higher than the
median premium achieved in comparable transactions in each of the last five years. The merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 45.7% over
$13.73, the closing price of Company common stock on the NYSE on March 14, 2017, the last trading day prior to the date on which a news organization reported
publicly that Virtu had made an offer to purchase the Company, and a premium of approximately 12.7% over $17.74, the closing price of Company common stock
on the NYSE on April 19, 2017, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger agreement;

• the possibility that, if the Company did not enter into the merger agreement, it could take a considerable amount of time before, and involve a substantial amount
of risk as to whether, the trading price of Company common stock would reach and sustain the $20.00 per share merger consideration, as adjusted for present
value; 

• the belief of the Company board that, as a result of the negotiations between the parties, the merger consideration of $20.00 per share was the highest price per
share for Company common stock that Virtu was willing to pay at the time of those negotiations, and that Virtu's agreement to pay that price would result in a sale
of the Company at the highest price per share for Company common stock that was reasonably attainable, particularly in view of the fact that no other parties
approached the Company with a proposal for a transaction at a higher price, even after the public disclosure of Virtu's bid range, and in spite of the Company's
efforts to solicit other proposals through Goldman Sachs; 

• the possibility that, if the Company did not enter into the merger agreement, there would not be another opportunity for the Company's stockholders to receive as
high or a higher price as a result of a sale of the Company within at least the intermediate future, in light of the belief of the Company board that there are
apparently few, if any, parties that would be willing to offer more than Virtu's current offer, as demonstrated by the fact that, of the six parties that were contacted
by Goldman Sachs regarding a possible combination, and Party A which contacted the Company directly and without solicitation, only Virtu was prepared to
make a proposal at that time, with the rest of the parties expressing no interest or initially expressing interest but withdrawing shortly thereafter; 

• the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Company board by representatives of Goldman Sachs; 

• the oral opinion of Goldman Sachs rendered to the Company board on April 20, 2017 (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Goldman
Sachs' written opinion to the Company board dated the same date) to the effect that, as of April 20, 2017, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to the
holders (other than Virtu and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. The opinion of Goldman Sachs is more fully described in the section entitled "—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC" beginning on page 31 and the
full text of such opinion is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C; 

• the fact that the merger consideration is to be paid entirely in cash, which will allow the Company's stockholders to realize, upon the closing, a certainty of value
and liquidity relative to the market, economic and other risks that arise from receiving an equity interest in a public company; 

• the availability of appraisal rights under Delaware law to Company stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and comply
with all of the required procedures under Delaware law for the perfection of such appraisal rights, which rights provide eligible stockholders with an opportunity
to have the Delaware Court of Chancery determine the fair value of their shares, which may be more than, less than or the same as the amount such stockholders
would have received under the merger agreement; 

• its multiple reviews and discussions with Company management and financial and legal advisors; 

• its understanding of the current and prospective environment in which the Company operates, including the performance of and dynamics affecting electronic
securities trading and the capital markets more generally (including the persistence of low volatility in capital markets in the

period prior to the Company's receipt of Virtu's initial proposal), national and local economic conditions, compression of profit margins in the industries in which
the Company operates and the likely effect of these factors on the Company and the proposed Restructuring Plan both with and without the proposed merger;

• the extensive review undertaken by the Company board and Company management, with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, with respect to the
Company's strategic outlook and the strategic alternatives available to the Company and the Company board's determination that the transaction with Virtu was
more favorable to Company stockholders than the potential value that might result from other alternatives reasonably available to the Company, including the
Restructuring Plan, based on factors including, but not limited to: 

• the inquiries by Goldman Sachs regarding a possible combination with six other parties and the likelihood of an alternative transaction emerging and that
no parties other than Party A approached the Company after the Virtu bid was made public; 

• the persistence of low market volatility in the 12-15 months prior to the Company's receipt of Virtu's initial proposal, which has put pressure on the
Company's financial performance, and the observation that the Company's trading strategies are more likely to perform well in market environments that
have moderate-to-high volatility; 

• the risk that the Company would not achieve the revenue growth projected in the Restructuring Plan and the risk that the Company would fail to
implement one or more transactions contemplated by the Restructuring Plan, including a proposal to refinance certain outstanding debt of the Company
and to return capital to shareholders; 

• the value of and challenges facing the Company as an independent company; and 

• the capital and earnings available to the Company as an independent company, at the time and as expected in the future, to pursue various business and
strategic initiatives; 

• the fact that the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including, but not limited to, the representations, warranties and covenants of the parties, the
conditions to closing and the form of the merger consideration, are reasonable and comparable to those in other recent acquisition transactions; 

• the fact that the terms of the merger agreement provide that, under certain circumstances, the Company is permitted to consider unsolicited acquisition proposals,
withdraw its approval or recommendation with respect to the merger agreement or terminate the merger agreement, subject, in each case, to compliance with
certain procedural requirements, which may include the payment of a $45 million termination fee; 

• the size of the termination fee in relation to the overall transaction size (i.e., approximately 3.5% of the transaction consideration) and the belief of the Company
board that the $45 million termination fee was unlikely to preclude another party that was interested in acquiring the Company from making an acquisition
proposal for the Company; 

• the absence of any financing condition or contingency to the merger and the fact that Virtu provided evidence of committed sources of equity and debt financing
that would enable it to consummate the merger; 

• the outside date under the merger agreement on which either party, subject to certain exceptions, can terminate the merger agreement allowing for sufficient time
to consummate the merger; 

• Virtu's commitments in the merger agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the proposed merger (subject to the terms and conditions of the
merger agreement), including

to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain promptly all required regulatory approvals and to obtain alternative financing if necessary; and

• the regulatory and other approvals in connection with the proposed transaction and the expected likelihood that such regulatory approvals will be received in a
reasonably timely manner.

        The Company board also considered the potential risks and other potentially negative factors related to the merger agreement and the merger, but concluded that the
anticipated benefits of the merger were likely to substantially outweigh these risks. These potential risks included:

• the amount of time it could take to complete the merger, primarily to obtain regulatory approvals and to obtain Company stockholder approval, and transaction-
related costs; 

• the fact that some of the Company's directors and executive officers have other interests in the merger that are in addition to their interests as stockholders of the
Company, including as a result of employment and compensation arrangements with the Company (see "The Merger—Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger"); 

• the risks and costs to the Company if the merger does not close, including the potential risk of diverting management and employee attention and resources from
the operation of Company business and towards the completion of the merger, potential employee attrition and the potential effects on business relationships,
including with customers and counterparties, and potential customers and counterparties; 

• the possibility that not all conditions to the closing of the merger, including the receipt of the necessary stockholder approval and regulatory approvals, may be
satisfied or waived such that the merger may be delayed or may not be consummated; 

• the possibility that the following factors, either individually or in combination, could discourage potential acquirers from making a competing bid to acquire the
Company: (i) the restrictions in the merger agreement on the Company's ability to solicit or engage in discussions or negotiations with any third parties regarding
acquisition proposals; (ii) the requirement that, unless the merger agreement is terminated, the Company must convene the special meeting and submit the merger
agreement to Company stockholders even if the Company board has withdrawn the Company recommendation for the merger proposal; (iii) the fact that Jefferies
has entered into a voting agreement with Virtu pursuant to which it has agreed, among other things, to vote all of the shares of Company common stock that it is
entitled to vote in favor of the merger agreement even if the Company board has withdrawn the Company recommendation; (iv) the risk of employee attrition,
including the loss of key employees following the announcement of the merger; and (v) the requirement that, in connection with a termination of the merger
agreement in certain circumstances and subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the Company could be required to pay Virtu a $45 million
termination fee or up to $15 million in expense reimbursements; 

• the fact that the all-cash merger consideration, while providing certainty of value and liquidity upon consummation of the merger, would not allow Company
stockholders to participate in any future earnings growth of the combined company after the merger or benefit from any future increase in its value; 

• the possible effect of any suit, action or proceeding in respect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; 

• the fact that the receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for Company common stock pursuant to the merger would be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes; and

• the fact that restrictions on the conduct of the Company's business prior to completion of the merger could delay or prevent the Company from undertaking
business opportunities that arise pending completion of the merger, which opportunities might be lost to the Company if the merger could not be completed.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Company board is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the material factors
considered by the Company board. In determining that the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the Company stockholders,
approving the merger agreement and the merger and declaring it advisable that the Company enter into the merger agreement, and recommending approval and adoption by the
Company stockholders of the merger agreement, the merger and any other matters submitted for their approval in connection with the merger agreement, the Company board did
not quantify or assign any relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Company board
considered all these factors as a whole, including discussions with, and questioning of, Company management and the Company's independent financial and legal advisors, and
overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and to support, its determination.

Unaudited Prospective Financial Information 

        The Company does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance, revenues, earnings or other financial results due to, among other
reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. As a result, the Company does not endorse the unaudited prospective financial information as a
reliable indicator of future results. The Company is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain unaudited prospective financial information that was
provided to the Company board, to Goldman Sachs, the financial advisor to the Company, for use in providing financial advice to the Company board, and to Virtu.
The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that any of the Company, Goldman Sachs, Virtu, their respective representatives or any other
recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be predictive of actual future results, or that it should be construed as financial guidance, and it should
not be relied on as such. Company management, with the approval of the Company board, directed Goldman Sachs to use the unaudited prospective financial
information with respect to the Company in connection with (i) the preparation of the financial analyses Goldman Sachs reviewed and discussed with the Company
board at its meeting on April 20, 2017 and (ii) the preparation of Goldman Sachs' opinion rendered orally to the Company board at that meeting. The only projections
used by the Company board in resolving to approve the merger were the Forecasts (as defined in "—Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC"), and Goldman Sachs did
not use or rely on any projections other than those included in the Forecasts to perform any of the financial analyses described in the preceding sentence.

        The unaudited prospective financial information reflects the Restructuring Plan described under "—Background of the Merger." The Restructuring Plan includes numerous
assumptions about future performance, as well as assumptions regarding the Company's ability to significantly reduce expenses, release significant trapped capital, refinance its
existing indebtedness and return capital to the Company stockholders. The Company board has not approved execution of the Restructuring Plan but has approved the Forecasts
included therein for use by Goldman Sachs, the financial advisor to the Company, for use in providing financial advice to the Company board.

        Actual results may differ materially from those set forth below, and important factors that may affect actual results and cause the unaudited prospective financial information
to be inaccurate include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the Company's business, industry performance, general business, market and economic
conditions, customer requirements, competition and adverse changes in applicable laws, regulations or rules. For other factors that could cause actual results to

"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2017 and the other reports filed by the Company with the SEC.

        The unaudited prospective financial information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date it was prepared. The Company can give no
assurance that, had the unaudited prospective financial information been prepared as of the date of this proxy statement, similar estimates and assumptions would be used. The
Company does not intend to, and disclaims any obligation to, make publicly available any update or other revision to the unaudited prospective financial information
to reflect circumstances existing since its preparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions
underlying the unaudited prospective financial information are shown to be in error, or to reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions. The unaudited
prospective financial information does not take into account the possible financial and other effects on the Company of the merger and does not attempt to predict or suggest
future results of the combined company. The unaudited prospective financial information does not give effect to the merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the
merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating the merger, the potential synergies that may be achieved by the combined company as a
result of the merger or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions which would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but which
were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger. Further, the unaudited prospective financial information does not take into account the
effect on the Company of any possible failure of the merger to occur. None of the Company, Goldman Sachs or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other
representatives has made, makes or is authorized in the future to make any representation to any Company stockholder or other person regarding the Company's ultimate
performance compared to the information contained in the unaudited prospective financial information or that the forecasted results will be achieved. The summary of the
unaudited prospective financial information included below is being provided solely because it was made available to the Company board, Virtu (with respect to certain of the
information) and Goldman Sachs, the financial advisor to the Company, for use in providing financial advice to the Company board, and not to influence your decision as to
whether to vote for the merger proposal or take any action in connection with the merger or your ownership of shares.

Table of Contents

        While presented with numeric specificity, the unaudited prospective financial information reflects numerous estimates and assumptions made with respect to business,
economic, market, competition, regulatory and financial conditions and matters specific to the Company's business, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are
beyond the Company's control. For example, for purposes of the Restructuring Plan, management of the Company assumed an effective tax rate of approximately 38%. The
unaudited prospective financial information reflects both assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and, in many respects, subjective judgment, and
thus is susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The Company can give no assurance that the
unaudited prospective financial information or the underlying estimates and assumptions will be realized. In addition, since the unaudited prospective financial information
covers multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. Furthermore, the unaudited prospective financial information should not
be construed as commentary by Company management as to how Company management expects the Company's actual results to compare to Wall Street research analysts'
estimates, as to which the Company expresses no view.

        The unaudited prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor was it prepared with a view toward compliance with GAAP,
published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial
information. Neither the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any
procedures with respect to the unaudited prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such

financial information. They do not extend to the unaudited prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.

        In light of the foregoing, and considering that the Company's special meeting will be held after the unaudited prospective financial information was prepared, as well as the
uncertainties inherent in any forecasted information, Company stockholders are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on such information, and the Company urges all
Company stockholders to review the Company's most recent SEC filings for a description of the Company's reported financial results. See "Where You Can Find More

The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Company common stock should vote with respect to the merger, or any other matter.

        In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

• the merger agreement; 

• annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the four fiscal years ended December 31, 2016; 

• the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-4, including the prospectus contained therein dated May 28, 2013 relating to the merger of Knight Capital
Group, Inc. and GETCO Holding Company, LLC; 

• certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; 

• certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders; 

• certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and 

• certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for Goldman Sachs' use by the Company, which are
referred to as the "Forecasts".

        Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations,
financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of Company common stock; compared certain financial
and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of
certain recent business combinations in the electronic trading industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors,
as it deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the Company's consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal,
regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by it, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that
regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the Company's consent that the Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the management of the Company. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent,
derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman
Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the
expected benefits of the merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger
agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.

        Goldman Sachs' opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the merger or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any
strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs' opinion addresses only the
fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of $20.00 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Virtu and its
affiliates) of shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs' opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or
aspect of the merger agreement or the merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument

contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the merger, including the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in
connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any
compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the merger, whether relative to the
$20.00 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Virtu and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or Virtu or the ability of the
Company or Virtu to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs' opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions,
as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its
opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs' opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman
Sachs.

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Company board in connection with rendering the opinion described above.
The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described
represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular
format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs' financial analyses. Except as otherwise
noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before April 17, 2017, the third trading day
before the Company's and Virtu's public announcement of the merger agreement, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

        Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis.    Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the Company's future value per
share of Company common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a company's equity as a function of such
company's estimated future earnings and its assumed price to future earnings per share multiple. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for each of the fiscal years
2019 to 2021. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied values per share of Company common stock as of fiscal year-end for each of the fiscal years 2017 to 2019, by applying
price to two-year forward earnings per share multiples of 8.0x to 12.0x earnings per share of Company common stock estimates for each of the fiscal years 2019 to 2021, and
then discounted back to March 31, 2017, using an illustrative discount rate of 12.2%, reflecting an estimate of the Company's cost of equity (derived by utilizing the Capital
Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for the Company, which Goldman Sachs derived by reviewing the historical beta of the
Company and selected companies which exhibited similar business characteristics to the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets
generally). These illustrative two-year forward earnings per share multiples were derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its experience and professional judgment, taking into
account current and historical trading data, the undisturbed trading price per share of Company common stock on March 14, 2017, $13.73, and adjusted analyst consensus two-
year forward earnings per share as of March 14, 2017 normalized for non-recurring depreciation and amortization (as provided by the Company). This analysis resulted in a range
of implied present values of $16.45 to $31.17 per share of Company common stock.

        Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.    Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the Company. Using discount
rates ranging from 9.0% to 11.0%, reflecting estimates of the Company's weighted average cost of capital (derived by utilizing the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires
certain company-specific inputs, including the Company's

target capital structure weightings, the pre-tax cost of debt, after-tax cost of debt, marginal tax rate and a beta for the Company, which beta Goldman Sachs derived by reviewing
the historical beta of the Company and selected companies which exhibited similar business characteristics to the Company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United
States financial markets generally), Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of March 31, 2017 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for the Company for the last nine
months of 2017 and for the years 2018 through 2021 as reflected in the Forecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for the Company, which were calculated by
applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from (2.0)% to 2.0%, to a terminal year estimate of the free cash flow to be generated by the Company, as reflected in the Forecasts. The
range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Forecasts, the Company's historical
and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Applying the range of growth rates and discount rates referenced above to the
Company's future unlevered cash flow forecasts implied a range of EBITDA (as defined below) multiples of 3.5x to 6.7x. Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise
values for the Company by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted, from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for the
Company, the amount of the Company's estimated net debt exclusive of restricted cash as of March 31, 2017 of $323 million (as provided by the Company), as provided by
management of the Company, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for the Company. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the
number of fully diluted outstanding shares of the Company, as provided by management of the Company, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share ranging from
$15.94 to $27.09.

        Selected Transactions Analysis.    Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions in the electronic trading industry since May
2011:

        While none of the target companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to the Company, the target companies that participated in the
selected transactions are companies with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of the Company's results, market size and product
profile. For the only selected transaction for which detailed financial information was publicly available, the Knight Capital Group, Inc. / GETCO Holding Company, LLC
transaction, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared Enterprise Value, or EV (as defined below) as a multiple of the estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or EBITDA (as defined below), using publicly available Wall Street research, for the year in which the transaction occurred, resulting in an EV / EBITDA multiple
of 7.2x. Goldman Sachs identified an illustrative range of EV / EBITDA multiples of 6.0x - 10.0x and applied that range of illustrative multiples to the Company's estimated
2017 adjusted EBITDA, as reflected in the Forecasts, which resulted in a range of illustrative prices per share of Company common stock of $12.17 to $23.49.

        Transaction Premia Analysis.    Using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed average and median premia for each calendar year, for
publicly disclosed all-cash acquisitions from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2016 that resulted in a sale of control of a U.S. target company and had a transaction value
greater than $250 million. Goldman Sachs calculated, for each year during this 2012 through 2016 period, the premia represented by the prices per share paid in these
transactions relative to the targets' closing share prices (i) one day and (ii) one week prior to announcement. Using such data, Goldman Sachs calculated the ranges of average and
median acquisition premia for each year for these transactions as 31% to 43% and 27% to 34%, respectively, for these one-day premia and 33% to 46% and 29% to 37%,
respectively, for these one-week premia. Goldman Sachs then applied an illustrative range of acquisition premia of 25% to 45% to $13.73, the undisturbed trading price per share
of Company common stock, to derive a range of illustrative implied prices per share of Company common stock of $17.16 to $19.91.

        Reference Information:    For reference purposes, Goldman Sachs performed additional analyses, which are summarized below.

        Selected Companies Analysis.    Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial information for the Company to corresponding financial information, ratios and
public market multiples for the following publicly traded corporations in the electronic trading industry (collectively referred to as the selected companies):

        Core Peers

• Virtu Financial, Inc. 

• Flow Traders N.V.

        Other Trading Peers

• NEX Group plc 

• INTL FCStone Inc. 

• Investment Technology Group, Inc.

        Selected Exchanges

• CME Group Inc. 

• Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. 

• Deutsche Börse Group 

• London Stock Exchange Group 

• Nasdaq, Inc. 

• CBOE Holdings, Inc.

Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with
operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of the Company.

        Goldman Sachs calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios using information it obtained from SEC filings, estimates from the Institutional Brokers'
Estimate System, which we refer to as "IBES estimates" (as well as estimates from the Forecasts in the case of the Company), and market

data as of April 17, 2017. With respect to its analysis, Goldman Sachs calculated for the Company and the selected companies:

• Enterprise Value (which is defined as the equity value, calculated using the number of fully diluted shares of Company common stock, as provided by
management of the Company and calculated using the treasury method, plus total debt, less total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents), which we refer to as
"EV", as a multiple of estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as "EBITDA", for the years ended December 31,
2017 and December 31, 2018, which are referred to below as "2017 EV/EBITDA" and "2018 EV/EBITDA", respectively; and 

• Closing price per share, as of April 17, 2017, in the case of the selected companies, and, for the Company, as of such date and as of the date of the undisturbed
trading price per share of Company common stock on March 14, 2017, $13.73, as a multiple of estimated GAAP earnings per share for the year ended
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, which is referred to below as "2017 GAAP P/E" and "2018 GAAP P/E", respectively. The results of these analyses
are summarized as follows:

        Goldman Sachs then applied an illustrative range of multiples of 9.6x to 14.4x, representing a 20% discount and premium to the Core Peer median multiple of 2018 GAAP
P/E, to the 2018 estimated earnings per share of Company common stock reflected in the Forecasts to obtain a range of implied values per share of $17.40 to $26.10.

        Present Value of Price / Book Multiple to RoE Regression Analysis.    Goldman Sachs performed a regression analysis using the price / book value multiples, which we refer
to as "P/B" for the following publicly traded companies (collectively referred to as the selected RoE companies) compared to the estimated 2018 return on equity, which we refer
to as the "2018E RoE", for the selected RoE companies using the median estimates for such companies published by IBES as of April 17, 2017, to derive a regression line
reflecting the range of P/B value multiples at a range of 2018E RoEs for the selected companies:

• BGC Partners, Inc. 

• Flow Traders N.V. 

• The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. 

• INTL FCStone Inc. 

• Investment Technology Group, Inc. 

• Morgan Stanley 

• Piper Jaffray Companies 

• Raymond James Financial, Inc. 

• Stifel Financial Corp. 

• Virtu Financial, Inc.

Although none of the selected RoE companies is directly comparable to the Company, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with
operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of the Company.

        The 2018E adjusted RoE for the Company on a stand-alone basis, as reflected in the Forecasts, corresponded to a P/B value per share multiple of 1.09x on the regression
line. By applying P/B value per share multiples ranging from 0.84x to 1.34x, reflecting P/B value multiples of 0.25x below and above the per share multiple of 1.09x on the
regression line, to the adjusted book value of the Company, adjusted for one-time charges (taxed at a rate of 38%) and the return of $400,000,000 of capital as reflected in the
Forecasts, Goldman Sachs derived implied values per share of Company common stock on a stand-alone basis ranging from $16.91 to $23.41.

        The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or
of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at
its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or
transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company or the contemplated merger.

        Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs' providing its opinion to the Company board as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
$20.00 in cash per share of Company common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Virtu and its affiliates) of shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon
forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these
analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events

beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the Company, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially
different from those forecast.

        The $20.00 per share merger consideration was determined through arm's-length negotiations between the Company and Virtu and was approved by the Company board.
Goldman Sachs provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Company
or the Company board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.

        As described above, Goldman Sachs' opinion to the Company board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Company board in making its determination to
approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the
fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex C.

        Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment management and other
financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities in which they
invest or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies,
credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Virtu, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including Leucadia National Corporation, the parent
of Jefferies, Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, an affiliate of a significant shareholder of Virtu ("Temasek"), the Republic of Singapore and its agencies or instrumentalities
(collectively, the "Republic of Singapore"), including the Singapore Minister for Finance, the sole shareholder of Temasek, North Island Holdings I, L.P. ("North Island"), which,
together with certain of its affiliates, is providing equity financing to Virtu in connection with the merger, GIC Private Limited ("GIC"), which is providing equity financing to
North Island in connection with the merger, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board ("PSP"), which is providing equity financing to North Island in connection with the
merger, and any of their respective affiliates and portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the merger for the accounts of Goldman Sachs and
its affiliates and employees and their customers.

        Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger. Goldman Sachs has
provided certain investment banking services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received,
and may receive, compensation. During the two year period ended April 20, 2017, the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has not been engaged by the Company
and/or its affiliates to provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has received compensation.

        Goldman Sachs has provided certain investment banking services to Virtu and/or its affiliates from time to time for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman

        Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide investment banking services to the Company, Virtu, Jefferies, Temasek, the Republic of Singapore, North Island, GIC and
PSP and their respective affiliates and, in the case of Jefferies, Temasek, North Island, GIC and PSP, portfolio companies for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman

time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of Jefferies, Temasek, North Island GIC or PSP from time to time and may do so in the future.

        The Company board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in
transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated April 11, 2017, the Company engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the
contemplated merger. The engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee of $15,000,000, $4,000,000 of which Goldman Sachs
became entitled to receive upon the execution of the engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation
of the merger. If the merger is not consummated, Goldman Sachs may be entitled to receive an advisory fee of $10,000,000 in connection with its advice relating to other
strategic alternatives that may be pursued by the Company, $4,000,000 of which Goldman Sachs became entitled to receive upon the execution of the engagement letter between
the Company and Goldman Sachs. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, and
to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Financing of the Merger 

        Virtu intends to finance the merger consideration with a combination of equity and debt financing (the sources of which we refer to as the "financing sources"). On April 20,
2017, in connection with the entry into the merger agreement by Virtu and the Company, Virtu entered into an investment agreement with North Island, an investment vehicle
funded by GIC, a sovereign wealth fund of Singapore, PSP, one of Canada's largest pension investment managers, and certain individuals, pursuant to which North Island
committed to purchase 40,064,103 shares of Virtu Class A common stock for approximately $625 million (which we refer to as the "NI investment"). At the same time, Virtu
entered into an investment agreement with Aranda Investments Pte. Ltd, an investment vehicle funded by Temasek, an investment company based in Singapore, pursuant to
which Aranda Investments Pte. Ltd committed to purchase 8,012,821 shares of Virtu Class A common stock for approximately $125 million (which we refer to as the "Temasek
investment", and which, together with the NI investment, we collectively refer to as the "equity financing"). The sale of shares is conditioned upon, among other things, the
closing of the merger. Virtu also entered into a commitment with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. to provide up to $1.65 billion of debt financing for the transaction.

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, Virtu is required to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the equity financing and the debt financing. Further, in the event that
any portion of the equity financing or the debt financing becomes unavailable, Virtu is required to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable alternate
equity financing or debt financing, as the case may be, on terms not materially less favorable to Virtu.

        The obligations of Virtu and Merger Sub to complete the merger are not contingent upon the receipt of the financing.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the Company board with respect to the merger, you should be aware that the Company's directors and executive officers have certain
interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of the other Company stockholders. The Company board was aware of and considered these
interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger, and in determining to recommend to Company common stockholders that
they vote for the merger proposal and thereby approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger. These interests are described below.

        The initial written proposal to acquire the Company presented by Virtu did not provide for any continuing role at the combined company for the Company's directors or
executive officers. No such roles have been discussed subsequently between the Company and Virtu.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards and Company Warrants

        The stock options, SARs and RSUs (which we collectively refer to as the "Company equity awards") held by the Company's directors and executive officers immediately
prior to the effective time will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment in the same manner as those Company equity awards held by other employees of the Company.
Company warrants held by the Company's directors and executive officers immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment upon
exercise in the same manner as the other outstanding Company warrants. As described further in the sections titled "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Company Equity
Awards" and "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Company Warrants", such awards and warrants will be subject to the following treatment:

• Stock Options:  At the effective time, each outstanding stock option granted under the Company stock plan will be cancelled and converted automatically into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to the stock option immediately prior to the
effective time and (y) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration of $20.00 per share over the exercise price per share of such stock option, less applicable
taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Any stock option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the merger
consideration of $20.00 per share will be cancelled at the effective time for no consideration or payment. 

• SARs:  At the effective time, each outstanding SAR granted under the Company stock plan will automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and will entitle the holder of such SAR to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
common stock subject to such SAR immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the merger consideration of $20.00 per share over
(y) the exercise price per share of such SAR, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Because all outstanding SARs have an
exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the merger consideration of $20.00 per share, all SARs will be cancelled at the effective time for no
consideration or payment. 

• RSUs:  At the effective time, each outstanding RSU under the Company stock plan will be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such RSU immediately prior to the effective time and
(y) the merger consideration of $20.00 per share, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. 

• Warrants:  At the effective time, each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of the Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number

of shares of Company common stock subject to the Company warrant immediately prior to the effective time and (y) the excess, if any, of the merger
consideration of $20.00 per share over the then-current exercise price per share of Company common stock (without giving effect to any of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement) previously subject to such Company warrant, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

        The following table sets forth for (i) each named executive officer, (ii) the three other executive officers (as a group) and (iii) the twelve non-employee directors (as a
group), the number of RSUs and stock options held by such executive officer or group of non-employee directors, as applicable, and the cash amounts payable (on a pre-tax
basis) in respect thereof, assuming solely for this purpose that the completion of the merger occurs on May 24, 2017. The amounts reflected in the table below are based on the
number of equity awards held by the executive officers and non-employee directors as of May 24, 2017 and depending on when the merger occurs, certain Company equity
awards that are unvested as of the date hereof and included in the table below may vest pursuant to their terms, independent of the merger.

Employment Arrangements with Executive Officers

        Messrs. Coleman, Parratt, Primmer, Tusar, Blum, McCarthy and Ogurtsov.    Each of Messrs. Coleman, Parratt, Primmer, Tusar, Blum, McCarthy and Ogurtsov is party to
an employment agreement with the Company (each, an "employment agreement" and collectively, the "employment agreements"). Under their employment agreements, each of
these executive officers will be entitled to certain severance payments and benefits if (a) his employment is terminated without "cause" or (b) he terminates his employment for
"good reason" (each as defined in the employment agreements). We use the term "qualifying termination" to refer to both a termination by the Company without cause and a
resignation by the executive for good reason.

Table of Contents

        Each employment agreement provides that in the event of a qualifying termination the executive officer will be entitled to receive:

• non-competition payments equal to 100% (200% for Mr. Coleman) of the executive officer's base salary; provided that for Mr. Tusar, the non-competition
payment is 50% of an amount equal to (a) his base salary plus (b) 75% of the cash portion of the annual incentive award paid in respect of the fiscal year
preceding the year in which the qualifying termination occurs. For each executive, the non-competition payments are paid in equal monthly installments over a
period of six months following the qualifying termination, subject to such executive's ongoing compliance with non-competition restrictions over the same period
(12 months for Mr. Coleman) and non-solicitation restrictions for a period of 18 months, provided that all non-solicitation and non-competition restrictions are
reduced to a six-month period following a qualifying termination; and 

• payment of COBRA health insurance premiums for up to 12 months following the qualifying termination.

        The executive officers are required to execute an effective and enforceable general release of all claims against the Company as a condition to receiving the payments and
benefits outlined above, and such benefits shall be reduced to give the best net-after-tax benefit to the executive in the case excise taxes are imposed under Section 280G of the
Code if any payments under the employment or otherwise payable in connection with the transaction would be deemed to be "excess parachute payments."

        Mr. Allison.    Pursuant to his employment agreement with the Company, the Company is required to give Mr. Allison six months' written notice to terminate his
employment, provided that the Company may, at its discretion, terminate Mr. Allison's employment with immediate effect and pay Mr. Allison's base salary over the six-month
period instead of giving advance notice of such termination. Mr. Allison's employment agreement requires that he comply with non-competition and non-solicitation covenants
for a period of 12 months following the termination of his employment.

2017 Fiscal Year Bonus

        In connection with negotiating the merger agreement, the parties agreed that each executive officer would be eligible to earn a bonus for the 2017 fiscal year in an amount
determined by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Upon a qualifying termination following the completion of the merger, each executive officer will be paid his 2017
bonus, provided, that payment of such amount shall be subject to the executive's delivery (and non-revocation) of a general release of claims and covenant not to sue in favor of
Virtu, the Company and their respective subsidiaries.

        For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would be payable to the Company's named executive officers upon a qualifying termination,
see "Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for the Company's Named Executive Officers—Golden Parachute Compensation," below.

Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance

        The merger agreement provides that all rights, existing as of the date of the merger agreement, to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the completion of the merger in favor of the current or former officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries will continue in full force and effect. The merger agreement also provides that, following completion of the merger, the surviving corporation will indemnify and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, all individuals who are, as of the date of the merger agreement and at any time from and after the date of

the merger agreement until the completion of the merger, directors or officers of the Company and its subsidiaries (in their capacity as such), against any costs, claims, expenses
and liabilities, whether arising before or after the effective time, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or its subsidiaries, and
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time, and will also advance expenses to such persons, provided that such person provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

        Subject to certain limitations, the merger agreement also requires the surviving corporation to maintain, for a period of six years after the completion of the merger, the
Company's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, or policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured, with respect to claims against present and former officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries
arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the effective time. The surviving corporation will not, however, be required to spend annually in the aggregate an amount
in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2016 under its current policy. In lieu of the foregoing, at the request of Virtu, the
Company may obtain at or prior to the effective time a six-year prepaid "tail" policy under the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policy providing coverage
equivalent to the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of the merger agreement. For additional information, see
the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Covenants and Agreements—Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance" of this proxy statement.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) whose shares of Company common stock
are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger. This summary does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to
Company stockholders. This discussion does not address the consequences of the merger to holders who receive cash pursuant to the exercise of appraisal rights. This discussion
applies to you only if you hold shares of Company common stock as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and does not apply to you if you are a member of a
special class of holders subject to special rules, including but not limited to:

• Company common stockholders that are not U.S. holders; 

• Dealers in securities; 

• Traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings; 

• Tax-exempt organizations; 

• Life insurance companies; 

• Financial institutions; 

• Regulated investment companies; 

• Real estate investment trusts; 

• Persons that use shares of Company common stock as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction; 

• Persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;

• Persons that acquired shares of Company common stock upon the exercise of stock options or otherwise as compensation; or 

• Stockholders who hold an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Virtu.

        This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the "Code"), its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations
promulgated thereunder, published rulings, administrative guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the "IRS") and court decisions, all as of the date of
this proxy statement. These laws and other authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.

        This discussion addresses only U.S. federal income taxation. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare
contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, nor does it address any aspect of foreign, state, local, alternative minimum, estate, gift or
other tax law that may be applicable to a holder.

        This discussion is intended to provide only a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders of shares of Company
common stock. The Company does not intend for this discussion to be a complete analysis or description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. The
U.S. federal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Accordingly, the IRS may not agree with the tax consequences described in this proxy statement.

        If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Company common stock, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend
on the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. A partner of a partnership holding Company common stock should consult the partner's tax
advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to such partner.

        Stockholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the merger in their particular circumstances, including the
applicability and effect of U.S. federal (including the alternative minimum tax), state, local or non-U.S. and other tax laws and of changes in those laws.

        For purposes of this discussion, we use the term "U.S. holder" to mean a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

• A corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States or any of its
political subdivisions; 

• A trust that (i) is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more U.S. persons or (ii) has a valid election in effect
under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or 

• An estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on the estate's income regardless of its source.

Tax Consequences of the Merger

        The exchange of shares of Company common stock for cash in the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S.
holder whose shares of Company common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received with respect to such shares (determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes, as
described below under "—Backup Withholding and Information

Reporting"), and (ii) the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis will generally equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares. Gain
or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Company common stock (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such capital gain or loss
will be long-term capital gain or loss, provided that the U.S. holder's holding period for each such block of shares of Company common stock exceeds one year at the effective
time. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders are generally eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal income taxation. There are limitations on the deductibility of
capital losses.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

        A U.S. holder may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (at a rate of 28%) with respect to the merger consideration,
unless such holder properly establishes an exemption or provides its correct tax identification number and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules.

        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules can be refunded or credited against a payee's U.S. federal income
tax liability, if any, provided that such U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.

        The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above are not intended to constitute a complete description of all tax consequences relating to the merger.
Because individual circumstances may differ, each stockholder should consult the stockholder's tax advisor regarding the applicability of the rules discussed above to
the stockholder and the particular tax effects to the stockholder of the merger in light of such stockholder's particular circumstances and the application of state, local
and foreign tax laws.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger 

        To complete the merger, the parties must make regulatory filings and obtain authorizations, approvals or consents necessary to obtain the required governmental approvals.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until any waiting periods applicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act have
expired or been terminated. On April 28, 2017, Virtu and the Company filed notification of the proposed merger with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as
the "FTC") and the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the "DOJ") under the HSR Act.

        On May 30, 2017, the FTC notified the Company that it had terminated the waiting period under the HSR Act effective as of May 30.

        At any time before or after consummation of the merger, the DOJ or the FTC (notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act) could take such
action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger and seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the Company or Virtu.
At any time before or after the completion of the merger (and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act), any state or non-U.S. governmental
entity could take such action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger and seeking divestiture of
substantial assets of the Company, Virtu or Merger Sub. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

        Rule 1017 of the National Association of Securities Dealers (which we refer to as the "NASD"), which is administered by the NASD's successor, FINRA, provides that a
FINRA member entity must file an application for approval of a change in the equity ownership of the member that results in one person or entity directly or indirectly owning or
controlling 25% or more of the equity capital of such

member at least 30 days prior to such change. KCG Americas LLC, a subsidiary of the Company and a FINRA member entity, submitted an application to FINRA on April 21,
2017 requesting approval of a change in control in connection with the merger.

        In addition, certain non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Company must make regulatory filings and obtain authorizations, approvals or consents from the FCA and from the FSA.
The Company and Virtu made the required filings with the FCA and the FSA on May 5, 2017.

        There can be no assurance that all of the required governmental approvals, or any other regulatory approvals that might be required to consummate the merger, will be
sought or obtained and, if obtained, there can be no assurance as to the timing of any approvals, ability to obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms or the absence of any
litigation challenging such approvals. There can also be no assurance that the DOJ, the FTC or any other governmental entity or any private party will not attempt to challenge
the merger on antitrust grounds, and, if such a challenge is made, there can be no assurance as to its result.

Litigation Related to the Merger 

        Between May 19 and May 23, 2017, five putative class actions relating to the Merger were filed by shareholders of KCG against KCG and its board of directors in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The cases are captioned Siegal v. KCG Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-3886, Berg v. KCG
Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-3802, Pauza v. KCG Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-3885, Evangelista v. KCG Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-3959, and
Klein v. KCG Holdings, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-3946. The Klein and Berg complaints also name as defendants Virtu and Merger Sub. The complaints assert that the
defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC by KCG in connection with the Merger.

        All five complaints allege, among other things, that the individual defendants and the Company violated federal securities laws by disseminating a preliminary proxy that
included allegedly material misstatements or omissions about the Merger and the sale process leading up to the Merger. Among other things, the complaints allege that the
preliminary proxy omits or misrepresents material information concerning: (i) the Company management's projections that were utilized by Goldman Sachs, the Company's
financial advisor in connection with the Merger, (ii) the valuation analyses prepared by Goldman Sachs in connection with the rendering of its fairness opinion, and (iii) the sale
process leading up to the Merger. The complaints seek, among other things, (i) an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining the Merger until the allegedly omitted
information is disclosed, (ii) rescission of the Merger or an award of damages in the event the merger is consummated, and (iii) an award of plaintiff's attorneys' fees and costs.
The defendants have not yet answered or otherwise responded to these complaints.

        On May 31, 2017, the parties to these litigations entered into a memorandum of understanding that sets forth an agreement in principle to settle and release all claims
asserted by plaintiffs in the litigations. The settlement is subject to, among other things, the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following discussion contains certain information about the merger and the merger agreement. The discussion is subject, and qualified in its entirety by reference, to the
merger agreement attached as Annex A to this proxy statement and incorporated herein by reference. We urge you to read carefully this entire proxy statement, including the
merger agreement attached as Annex A, for a more complete understanding of the merger.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement 

        The merger agreement and this summary of terms are included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the merger agreement. Factual disclosures about the
Company and Virtu contained in this proxy statement or in the public reports of the Company and Virtu filed with the SEC may supplement, update or modify the factual
disclosures about the Company and Virtu contained in the merger agreement. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by the Company, on the one hand,
and Virtu, on the other hand. The representations, warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by the Company and Virtu were qualified and subject to important
limitations that were negotiated and agreed to by the Company and Virtu. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement,
and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing circumstances in
which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger and allocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing
matters as facts. The representations and warranties also may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally relevant to investors or applicable to
reports and documents filed with the SEC, and some were qualified by the matters contained in confidential disclosure schedules that the Company and Virtu each delivered in
connection with the merger agreement and certain documents filed with the SEC. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties,
which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the merger agreement.

        For the foregoing reasons, the representations and warranties, or any descriptions of those provisions, should not be read alone or relied upon as characterizations of the
actual state of facts or condition of the Company, Virtu or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Instead, such provisions or descriptions should be read only in
conjunction with the other information provided elsewhere in this document or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. See "Where You Can Find More
Information." The Company will provide additional disclosures in their public reports to the extent they are aware of the existence of any material facts that are required to be
disclosed under federal securities laws and that might otherwise contradict the terms and information contained in the merger agreement and will update such disclosure as
required by federal securities laws.

Structure of the Merger 

        Each of the Company's and Virtu's respective boards of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger. Under the merger agreement, Merger
Sub, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Virtu, will merge with and into the Company, so that the Company will be the surviving entity in the merger and will be an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Virtu when the merger is completed.

Merger Consideration

        In the merger, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, except for specified shares held by the Company or
owned by Virtu or Merger Sub

and shares of Company common stock held by Company stockholders who properly exercise dissenters' rights, shall be converted into the right to receive $20.00 in cash without
interest.

        At the effective time, all Company common stock will convert into the right to receive the merger consideration, will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
cancelled and will cease to exist, and will thereafter represent only the right to receive the merger consideration to be paid in accordance with the merger agreement.

        The price to be paid for each share of Company common stock in the merger will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any change in the outstanding shares of
Company common stock, including if the Company pays dividends in, splits, combines into a smaller number or issues by reclassification any shares of Company common stock
(or undertakes any similar act) prior to the effective time.

        At the effective time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into one share of common
stock of the surviving corporation.

        Shares of Company common stock held by the Company as treasury stock (other than shares in a Company plan (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—Covenants and
Agreements")) or owned by Virtu or Merger Sub (other than shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties) immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and shares held by Company stockholders who have properly
exercised appraisal rights with respect to their shares, will be cancelled, and no merger consideration will be paid with respect to those shares.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards 

        Stock Options:    At the effective time, each outstanding stock option under the Company stock plan will be cancelled and will entitle the holder of such stock option to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such stock option immediately prior to the effective time and
(ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the merger consideration of $20.00 per share over (y) the exercise price per share of such stock option, less applicable taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payment. Any stock option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the merger consideration of $20.00 per share will be cancelled
at the effective time for no consideration or payment.

        SARs:    At the effective time, each outstanding SAR granted under the Company stock plan will be cancelled and will entitle the holder of such SAR to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such SAR immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) the excess of (x) the merger
consideration of $20.00 per share over (y) the exercise price per share of such SAR, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Because all
outstanding SARs have an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the merger consideration of $20.00 per share, all SARs will be cancelled at the effective time for
no consideration or payment.

        RSUs:    At the effective time, any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding RSU under the Company stock plan, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and
will entitle the holder of such RSU to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such RSU immediately
prior to the effective time and (y) the merger consideration of $20.00 per share, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

Treatment of Company Warrants 

        Each of the Company's Class A warrants to purchase shares of the Company common stock for a purchase price per share of $11.70, the Company's Class B warrants to
purchase shares of the Company common stock for a purchase price per share of $13.16, the Company's Class C warrants to purchase shares of the Company common stock for a
purchase price per share of $14.63 issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company common stock subject to such Company warrant and (B) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the
then-current exercise price per share of Company common stock (without giving effect to any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) previously subject to
such Company warrant, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment (such amount being referred to as the "warrant consideration").

Closing and Effective Time 

        The merger will be completed only if all conditions to the merger discussed in this proxy statement and set forth in the merger agreement are either satisfied or waived. See
"—Conditions to Complete the Merger."

        The merger will become effective as set forth in the certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement will occur on the later of (i) the fifth business day following the first day on which there is satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
set forth in the merger agreement and (ii) the earlier of (A) a date during the marketing period selected by Virtu on one business day's notice to the Company and (B) the fifth
business day following the final day of the marketing period, in each case unless changed by mutual agreement of the parties. It currently is anticipated that the completion of the
merger will occur in the third quarter of 2017 subject to the receipt of stockholder and required governmental approvals and the satisfaction of other closing conditions, but
neither the Company nor Virtu can guarantee when or if the merger will be completed.

        As used herein, "marketing period" means the first period of 17 consecutive business days, throughout and at the end of which Virtu has obtained all necessary information
from the Company in connection with the debt financing.

Delivery of Merger Consideration 

        At or promptly after the effective time, and in any event within two business days thereafter, Virtu shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected
by Virtu and consented to by the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), for the benefit of the Company's stockholders, an amount in cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate merger consideration, to be paid in exchange for outstanding shares of Company common stock.

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the warrant consideration will be paid by the surviving corporation in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement
between the Company and Computershare Shareowner Services LLC, dated July 1, 2013 (which we refer to as the "warrant agreement").

        The conversion of Company common stock into the right to receive the merger consideration will occur automatically at the effective time. After completion of the merger,
the paying agent will exchange certificates representing shares of Company common stock for the merger consideration to be received pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement.

        As soon as reasonably practicable after the completion of the merger, and in any event within five business days thereafter, the paying agent will mail to each holder of
record of Company common

stock immediately prior to the effective time a letter of transmittal and instructions on how to surrender shares of Company common stock in exchange for the merger
consideration the holder is entitled to receive under the merger agreement.

        Upon surrender to the paying agent of a certificate or certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of uncertificated shares to the paying agent, together with a
properly completed letter of transmittal, each Company stockholder eligible to receive the merger consideration will be entitled to receive the merger consideration for each share
of Company common stock formerly represented by a certificate or for each uncertificated share of Company common stock.

        If a certificate for Company common stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the paying agent will issue the merger consideration upon receipt of an affidavit of that fact by
the claimant and, if required by the surviving corporation, the posting of a bond in an amount as Virtu may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such certificate.

        After completion of the merger, there will be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company common stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. If, after the effective time, certificates or uncertificated shares are presented to the surviving corporation, they will be
cancelled and exchanged for the merger consideration to be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in the merger agreement.

Appraisal Rights

        If required by the DGCL, Company stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who otherwise comply with the applicable
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to exercise appraisal rights thereunder. Any shares of Company common stock held by a Company stockholder as of the
record date who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who has validly made and not effectively withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL will not be converted into a right to receive the merger consideration unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. See
"Appraisal Rights."

        Under the merger agreement, the Company must give Virtu (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company relating to Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. The Company may not, except with the prior written consent of Virtu, make any payments with
respect to any demands for appraisal or settle, compromise, offer to settle or compromise, or otherwise negotiate any such demands.

        THE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH TECHNICAL PREREQUISITES. IF YOU
WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLIANCE
UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, THE FULL TEXT OF WHICH AS OF THE DATE HEREOF IS ATTACHED TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT AS ANNEX D.

Withholding

        Virtu and the paying agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the merger consideration the amounts they are required to deduct and withhold under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. If any such amounts are withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental

entity, these amounts will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to the stockholders from whom they were withheld.

• the accuracy of information supplied for inclusion in the information statement distributed by Virtu regarding the approval of the equity financing by its
stockholders; and 

• related party transactions.

        In addition, certain representations and warranties are made only by Virtu and Merger Sub (which we refer to together as the "Acquirer Parties"), including:

• ownership and operations of Merger Sub; and

        Certain representations and warranties of the Acquirer Parties and the Company are qualified as to knowledge, "materiality," "material adverse effect" or material delay or
material impairment of the ability of the Acquirer Parties to consummate the merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on a timely basis.

material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, excluding the impact of:

or any act of terrorism) or changes in the securities, credit or financial markets;

and its subsidiaries, taken

        For purposes of the merger agreement, a "material adverse effect" with respect to the Acquirer Parties means a material adverse effect on the ability of the Acquirer Parties
to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Covenants and Agreements 

Conduct of Businesses Prior to the Completion of the Merger

        The Company has agreed to certain restrictions on itself and its subsidiaries, and its and their conduct of business, prior to the completion of the merger (or earlier
termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms). In general, the Company will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, (i) conduct its and its subsidiaries'
operations in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to preserve intact the business organization of the Company and
its subsidiaries and to preserve the goodwill of customers, suppliers and all other persons having business relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries.

        Without limiting the foregoing, prior to the completion of the merger (or earlier termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms), the Company has also
agreed that, except as otherwise required by the merger agreement or as disclosed in the confidential disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Virtu at the time of the
merger agreement, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its subsidiaries to do any of the following without the prior written consent of Virtu (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld):

• adopt or propose any change in its organizational documents; 

• engage in any material transaction (including capital expenditures) outside of the ordinary course of business that would require expenditures by the surviving
corporation, Virtu or any of Virtu's subsidiaries in excess of $5 million per annum or $10 million in the aggregate; 

• issue, reissue, sell, grant, pledge or otherwise encumber, or authorize the issuance, reissuance, sale, grant, pledge or other encumbrance of shares of Company
capital stock, or securities convertible into capital stock of any class of the Company, or any rights, warrants or options to acquire any convertible securities or
capital stock of the Company (other than the issuance of shares of Company capital stock in connection with the exercise of Company equity awards or Company
warrants, in each case outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement in accordance with the Company stock plan or the warrant agreement, respectively, in
each case as in effect as of the date of the merger agreement); 

• (i) increase the compensation or benefits payable or provided to any current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor, other than any such
increases made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice for employees whose total annual compensation does not exceed $300,000,
(ii) grant or pay to any current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor any severance, change in control or termination pay, or
modifications thereto or increases therein, other than pursuant to any Company plan (as defined below) as in effect on the date hereof, in accordance with their
terms as in effect on such date, (iii) pay any benefit or grant or amend any award (including in respect of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance
units, restricted stock or other stock-based or stock-related awards or the removal or modification of any restrictions in any Company plan or awards made
thereunder) except as required to comply with any applicable law or any Company plan as in effect as of the date hereof, (iv) adopt, enter into, amend, modify or
terminate any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract, (v) take any action to accelerate the vesting or payment of any compensation or

Regulatory Matters

        Virtu and the Company have agreed to cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, approvals, rulings and authorizations required by law, including of all third parties
and governmental entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to comply with the terms and conditions
of all such permits, consents, approvals, rulings and authorizations of all such third parties and government entities. Without limitation to the foregoing, as soon as practicable
and in no event later than 15 days after the date of the merger agreement, the parties agree to prepare and file any applications, notices and filings required to be filed with any
regulatory agency in order to obtain the required governmental approvals. All such applications, notices and filings related to required governmental approvals were made on or
before the date hereof.

        However, Virtu will not be required to take, and shall not be required to cause its affiliates to take, any action that would result in a material adverse effect on the surviving
corporation and the Acquirer Parties on a combined basis after the merger.

        Virtu and the Company have also agreed to furnish each other with all information reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or
application to any governmental entity in connection with the merger, as well as to promptly keep each other apprised of the status of matters related to the completion of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Employee Benefit Matters

        During the one-year period commencing at the effective time and ending on the first anniversary of the closing, Virtu has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to
provide each Company employee who continues to be employed by the surviving corporation after the effective time (which we refer to as a "continuing employee") with (i) (x)
base salary or base wage and (y) target annual cash bonus opportunities that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of Virtu or (ii) (x) base salary or base
wage and (y) target annual cash bonus opportunities that are substantially comparable to those provided by the Company immediately prior to the effective time and
(iii) employee benefits in the aggregate that are either (x) generally made available to similarly situated employees of Virtu or (y) substantially comparable to those provided by
the Company immediately prior to the effective time. Virtu will or will cause the surviving corporation to provide to each continuing employee whose employment terminates
during the one-year period with severance benefits pursuant to and in accordance with the Company's broad-based severance plan currently in effect, without taking into account
any reduction in compensation paid to such continuing employee after the effective time.

        Following the effective time, with respect to any employee benefit plans of Virtu in which any continuing employees become eligible to participate (which we refer to as
"new plans"), subject to certain customary exclusions, Virtu will or will cause the surviving corporation to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions, evidence of
insurability and waiting periods except to the extent they would apply under the most closely analogous Company benefit plans; (ii) provide credit for any eligible expenses
incurred prior to the effective time of the merger under a Company benefit plan in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements under any new
plans; and (iii) recognize all service of continuing employees for all purposes in any new plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the most closely
analogous Company benefit plan prior to the effective time of the merger, provided that the service recognition shall not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of
benefits for the same period of services, for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits.

Table of Contents

        Prior to the effective time, the Company will take irrevocable action, effective of and contingent upon the closing, to terminate the Company's voluntary deferred
compensation, incentive unit and deferred cash plans. Virtu will or will cause the surviving corporation to distribute all balances in such plans to the applicable participants as
soon as practicable following the closing through the surviving corporation's payroll.

Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance

        The merger agreement provides that all rights, existing as of the date of the merger agreement, to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the completion of the merger in favor of the current or former officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries will continue in full force and effect. The merger agreement also provides that, following completion of the merger, the surviving corporation will indemnify and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, all individuals who are, as of the date of the merger agreement and at any time from and after the date of the
merger agreement until the completion of the merger, directors or officers of the Company and its subsidiaries (in their capacity as such), against any costs, claims, expenses and
liabilities, whether arising before or after the effective time, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or its subsidiaries, and
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time, and will also advance expenses to such persons, provided that such person provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

        The merger agreement requires the surviving corporation to maintain, for a period of six years after completion of the merger, the Company's existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy, or policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the insured, with respect to claims against present and former officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries arising from facts or events that occurred
at or prior to the completion of the merger. However, the surviving corporation is not required to spend annually more than 300% of the annual premium by the Company for
such insurance for the year ended December 31, 2016 (which we refer to as the "maximum amount"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed that
amount, then Virtu will maintain policies of insurance which, in its good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the
maximum amount. If the surviving corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by the merger agreement, it will obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for
the years within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the maximum amount, in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of such insurance, Virtu
may direct the Company to obtain at or prior to the effective time a "tail" policy under the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policy. If the Company purchases
such a "tail" policy, Virtu must maintain the policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations under the policy.

Financing

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, Virtu is required to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the equity financing and the debt financing. Further, in the event that
any portion of the equity financing or the debt financing becomes unavailable, Virtu is required to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable alternate
equity financing or debt financing, as the case may be, on terms not materially less favorable to Virtu. To the extent Virtu is unable to obtain any amount of alternate equity
financing, Virtu is required to draw upon any additional amounts available under the debt financing to cover the shortfall.

        The Company has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to provide to Virtu such reasonable cooperation that is customary in connection with the arrangement of the debt
financing, as reasonably

requested by Virtu, including by using its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause members of the Company's senior management and other representatives to be available, upon
reasonable advance notice, to participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, (ii) furnish to Virtu as promptly as
reasonably practicable information about the Company that the Company has agreed to provide in connection with preparing customary documents in connection with any
offering document or marketing materials related to the debt financing, (iii) assist with the preparation of pro forma financial statements, (iv) issue customary representation
letters to the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and using reasonable best efforts to obtain, consistent with customary practice, necessary consents to the
inclusion of the Company's financial information and reports in connection with any offering document related to the debt financing; (v) provide customary authorization letters
to debt financing sources; (vi) provide documentation required by applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering laws and regulations; (vii) assist with the
preparation and execution of certain contracts for indebtedness, including the definitive agreements in connection with the debt financing; (viii) permit the debt financing sources
to evaluate the Company's assets and cash management policies; (ix) take necessary corporate actions to effect the debt financing; (x) obtain customary evidence of authority and
deliver other customary ancillary documents in connection with the closing of the debt financing; (xi) allow access to existing lending relationships of the Company and
(xii) effect the payoff of the Company's Credit Agreement, dated June 5, 2015, among KCG Americas LLC, the Company, Bank of America, N.A., BMO Harris Bank N.A., and
the financial institutions from time to time party thereto, concurrently with the closing of the merger.

        Virtu has agreed to, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company or its subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation provided by the Company.

        The obligations of Virtu and Merger Sub to complete the merger are not contingent upon the receipt of the financing.

Certain Additional Covenants

        The merger agreement also contains additional covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the filing of this proxy statement, obtaining required consents,
access to information, exemption from takeover laws, public announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the taking of steps to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by directors and officers of the Company to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the delisting of Company common stock, cooperation with respect to stockholder litigation, integration, and employee matters
and the taking of steps to satisfy and discharge the notes of the Company issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated March 13, 2015, between the Company and The Bank of New
York Mellon, as Trustee.

Stockholder Meeting and Recommendation of the Company Board of Directors 

        The Company has agreed to hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of voting upon adoption of the merger agreement and other related matters as soon as
reasonably practicable. The Company board has agreed to communicate to its stockholders its recommendation (and include such recommendation in this proxy statement) that
they adopt the merger agreement.

        As discussed more fully below, the Company has agreed not to solicit any alternative proposal or offer to merge or acquire 20% or more of the Company. However, if (i) the
Company board is presented with an unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal and, after consultation with its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors, determines in good faith that such unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in

a superior company proposal (defined below), or (ii) other than in connection with an unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal, an event, fact, circumstance, development
or occurrence that affects the business, assets or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries that is unknown to the Company board as of the date of the merger agreement
becomes known to the Company board, and, in each case, the Company board concludes in good faith, following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to make a
company adverse recommendation change is reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the Company stockholders, then it may make a Company adverse recommendation
change, provided that:

• the Company gives Virtu at least five business days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action and certain information about the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including (i) in the case of a takeover proposal, the latest material terms and conditions of, and
the identity of the third party in any such takeover proposal or any amendment or modification thereof or (ii) in the case of an unknown and not reasonably
foreseeable intervening event, the nature of the intervening event); and 

• the Company board takes into account any changes to the merger agreement committed to in writing by Virtu (which shall be negotiated in good faith by the
Company) that (i) in the event of a superior company proposal, result in a transaction that is no less favorable to the Company stockholders than any superior
company proposal in the absence of such changes or (ii) in the event of an unknown and not reasonably foreseeable intervening event, the Company board would
no longer be required to make a Company adverse recommendation change (defined below) in order not to be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to
the Company stockholders. In the event Virtu agrees to make such changes to the merger agreement in either case of clause (i) or (ii) above, as applicable, no
Company adverse recommendation change will be made.

        Notwithstanding any Company adverse recommendation change (defined below), unless the merger agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Company is required to convene the special meeting and to submit the merger agreement to a vote of Company stockholders.

        Except as set forth above, the Company board shall not, and shall not resolve or agree to, (i) withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Virtu, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Virtu, the Company recommendation, (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or
declare advisable, any takeover proposal, (iii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company
or any of its subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, asset or share purchase or share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any takeover proposal, (iv) enter into any agreement, letter of intent or agreement in principle requiring the
Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the merger, (v) fail to recommend against acceptance of any takeover proposal involving a tender offer or exchange offer
for Company common stock within 10 business days after the commencement of such offer or (vi) fail to include the Company recommendation in the proxy statement or to re-
affirm the Company recommendation within ten (10) business days of a request by Virtu to do so (any of the above a "Company adverse recommendation change").

        The Company may not adjourn, postpone or recess the special meeting without the prior written consent of Virtu and, unless there has been a Company adverse
recommendation change, the Company must adjourn or postpone such meeting if there are insufficient shares of Company common stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the special meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary for adoption of the merger agreement (in each

case, so long as such meeting is not adjourned, postponed or recessed to a date that is later than January 31, 2018).

Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers 

        The Company has agreed that it will not, and will cause its affiliates and its and their officers, directors or employees, agents, affiliates and representatives not to, directly or
indirectly:

• solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate (including by way of providing information) any takeover proposal or any inquiry or proposal that
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to result in a takeover proposal; 

• participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or cooperate in any way with
any person (whether or not a person making a takeover proposal) with respect to any takeover proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be
expected to result in a takeover proposal; 

• approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any takeover proposal; 

• approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding,
merger agreement, asset or share purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any takeover proposal; 

• enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by, or
breach its obligations under, the merger agreement; or 

• propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, a "takeover proposal" means, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, any offer or proposal with respect to
any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of
the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition of more than 20% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock or
voting power of the Company, (iii) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business
combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in the Company or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise) of any business or assets of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(iv) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any person (or the stockholders of any person) or group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of the Company, (v) any tender offer or exchange offer as a result
of which any person or group shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of 20% or more of the voting power of the
Company or (vi) any combination of the foregoing.

        However, in the event that, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by the Company's stockholders, the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written takeover
proposal, after the date of the merger agreement (which did not result from a breach of the Company's agreement not to solicit other offers) and the Company board concludes in
good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that such takeover proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
result in a superior company proposal and that failure to make a Company adverse recommendation change is reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the

stockholders under applicable law, the Company may (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and any of its subsidiaries to the third party making such takeover
proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the confidentiality agreement between Virtu and the Company and
which contains a customary standstill provision, so long as any material non-public information provided under this clause has previously been provided to Virtu or is provided to
Virtu substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such third party, and (y) participate in discussions regarding the terms of such takeover proposal and the
negotiation of such terms with the third party making such takeover proposal; provided, that the Company will within 24 hours provide Virtu with any information with respect to
the Company and any of its subsidiaries provided to such third party which was not previously provided to Virtu (or its representatives). The Company has agreed that neither it
nor any of its subsidiaries will terminate, waive, amend, modify or fail to use reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing standstill, confidentiality or similar obligations owed
by any third party to the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any outstanding agreement relating to a potential acquisition of the Company or any material portion of its
assets, in each case except to the extent necessary to permit the Company to take an action it is otherwise permitted to take under the merger agreement; provided, that the
Company has waived any such standstill obligation to the extent necessary to permit a third party otherwise covered by such standstill to submit a confidential unsolicited bona
fide written takeover proposal to the Company board. The Company will within 24 hours advise Virtu orally of the receipt of any takeover proposal and the substance thereof
(including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such takeover proposal), and will keep Virtu informed in all material respects of the status
and details of the takeover proposal on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or takeover proposal.

        As used in the merger agreement, "superior company proposal" means a bona fide unsolicited written takeover proposal (substituting "50%" for "20%," in the definition
thereof) which the Company board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors, (i) to be superior to the holders of Company
common stock from a financial point of view than (x) the merger (including the merger consideration), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and the
person making the proposal (including all financial, regulatory, legal conditions to consummation and other aspects of such proposal), and (y) the merger agreement (including
any changes proposed by Virtu to the terms of the merger agreement), and (ii) is reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed and (iii) for which all requisite
cash funds are or will be immediately available or will be committed by identified financing sources at the time of signing a definitive transaction agreement.

Certain Permitted Disclosure 

        Nothing in the merger agreement will prevent the Company or the Company board from complying with Rule 14a-9, Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any
legally required disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to do so
would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law or such disclosure is otherwise required under applicable law.

Conditions to Complete the Merger 

        The Acquirer Parties' and the Company's respective obligations to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

• all required governmental approvals shall have been obtained; 

• the absence of any order, injunction, ruling, decree or judgment by any court or agency of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition (including
the enactment or promulgation of any law, regulation or rule by any governmental authority or stock exchange or other self-regulatory organization with
jurisdiction over the Company, Virtu or their respective subsidiaries) prohibits or makes illegal the completion of the merger; 

• twenty (20) days must have elapsed since Virtu distributed an information statement regarding the approval of the equity financing by its stockholders; 

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement as of the date on which the merger agreement was entered into and as of the
date on which the merger is completed, subject to the materiality standards provided in the merger agreement (and the receipt by each party of an officer's
certificate from the other party to such effect); and 

• the performance by the other party in all material respects of all obligations required to be performed by it under the merger agreement at or prior to the date on
which the merger is completed (and the receipt by each party of an officer's certificate from the other party to such effect).

        In addition, the Acquirer Parties will not be obligated to complete the merger if there has been a material adverse effect with respect to the Company since the date of the
merger agreement.

        None of the Company, Virtu or Merger Sub can provide assurance as to when or if all of the conditions to the merger can or will be satisfied or waived by the appropriate
party. As of the date of this proxy statement, the Company has no reason to believe that any of these conditions will not be satisfied.

Termination of the Merger Agreement 

        The merger agreement can be terminated at any time prior to completion of the merger (whether before or after the adoption of the merger agreement by the Company
stockholders (unless otherwise specified below)) in the following circumstances:

• by the mutual written consent of Virtu and the Company; 

• by either Virtu or the Company if: 

• the merger has not been completed on or before January 31, 2018, except that, if the failure of the merger to be consummated by that date is primarily due
to the breach by the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in the merger
agreement, such party shall not be permitted to terminate the merger agreement; 

• any injunction permanently restrains, enjoins or prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the merger, and such injunction becomes effective (and
final and nonappealable) or any law becomes enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any governmental authority that prohibits or makes illegal
consummation of the merger; 

• Company stockholders do not approve the merger proposal; 

• by the Company, (i) if there has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Virtu or Merger Sub contained in the
merger agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition to the Company's obligation to complete the merger and which is not curable or
cured within the earlier of thirty (30) days and January 31, 2018, and (ii) the Company is not then in breach of any representation, warranty,

covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement such that it would give rise to the failure of a condition to Merger Sub's obligation to complete the
merger;

• by Virtu, (i) if there has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company contained in the merger
agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition to Virtu's obligation to complete the merger and which is not curable or cured within the
earlier of thirty (30) days and January 31, 2018, and (ii) Virtu is not then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in the merger
agreement such that it would give rise to the failure of a condition precedent to the Company's obligation to complete the merger; 

• by Virtu if, prior to obtaining the approval of Company stockholders of the merger proposal: 

• the Company board fails to recommend to the Company stockholders that they approve the merger proposal, or effects a Company adverse
recommendation change; or 

• the Company or the Company board has materially breached its obligations with respect to obtaining stockholder approval or not soliciting other offers in
a manner adverse to Virtu.

Effect of Termination 

        If the merger agreement is terminated, it will become void and have no effect, except that designated provisions of the merger agreement will survive the termination,
including those relating to payment of a termination fee, expense reimbursement and the confidential treatment of information.

Termination Fee 

        The Company will pay Virtu a termination fee in the amount of $45 million if the merger agreement is terminated in the following circumstances:

• prior to obtaining the approval of Company stockholders of the merger proposal, Virtu terminates the merger agreement because the Company board fails to
recommend to the Company stockholders that they approve the merger proposal or effects a Company adverse recommendation change; 

• prior to obtaining the approval of Company stockholders of the merger proposal, Virtu terminates the merger agreement because the Company or the Company
board has materially breached its obligations with respect to obtaining stockholder approval or not soliciting other offers in a manner adverse to Virtu; and 

• prior to the Company stockholder meeting, (i) a Company takeover proposal is publicly made or otherwise communicated in writing to the Company's senior
management or the Company board and not expressly withdrawn, and (ii) the merger agreement is terminated because (x) the Company stockholders fail to adopt
the merger agreement at the special meeting, (y) a material breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the Company results in the failure of a
condition to Virtu's obligation to complete the merger and Virtu elects not to complete the merger or (z) the merger is not completed by January 31, 2018 and, in
the case of (y) and (z), the approval of Company stockholders of the merger proposal has not been obtained at the time of such termination, and (iii) within
12 months of the termination of the merger agreement, the Company consummates a transaction (or enters into a definitive agreement to do so) with respect to a
takeover proposal, provided that, for purposes of the foregoing, all references in the definition of takeover proposal to "20%" will instead refer to "50%".

        The Company will pay Virtu an amount equal to that required to reimburse Virtu and its affiliates for all of their documented out-of-pocket expenses in an amount not to
exceed $15 million (and which

will be credited against any termination fee owed in the event that Virtu would be entitled to both the termination fee and expense reimbursement) if the merger agreement is
terminated by Virtu or the Company because the Company stockholder approval is not obtained at the Company stockholder meeting duly convened.

        Any termination fee that becomes due must be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds (i) under the circumstances described in the first or second bullet above, on the
business day immediately following the date of termination of the merger agreement and (ii) under the circumstances described in the third bullet above, on the date of the first to
occur of the events described in clause (iii) of that bullet.

        In the event that the termination fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to the merger agreement, the termination fee will be Virtu's and Merger Sub's
sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under the merger agreement.

Other Provisions 

Expenses and Fees

        Unless a specific term of the merger agreement provides for a different arrangement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement will be paid
by the party incurring such expense, whether or not the merger is consummated, except that expenses incurred in connection with printing and mailing of this proxy statement
and in connection with notices or other filings with any governmental authorities under any laws shall be shared equally by Virtu and the Company.

Amendment, Waiver and Extension of the Merger Agreement

        Subject to compliance with applicable law, the merger agreement may only be amended by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by, in the case of any modification
or amendment, each of Virtu, Merger Sub and the Company, provided that any modification or amendment that is adverse in any respect to the financing sources must be
consented to in writing by the financing sources, and provided further that after adoption of the merger agreement by the Company stockholders, there may not be, without
further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of the merger agreement that requires further approval under applicable law.

Specific Performance

        The parties have agreed in the merger agreement that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of the merger agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, prior to the valid
termination of the merger agreement, each of the parties is entitled to specific performance of the terms of the merger agreement, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the merger agreement (including the obligation to consummate the merger) in addition
to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties also waives, in the merger agreement, (i) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy of monetary damages would be adequate and (ii) any right to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable for any reason.

        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the merger agreement, to the extent permitted by law, (i) the Company and its affiliates (other than Virtu and Merger
Sub) will not commence or prosecute any claim, at law or in equity, against any financing source in connection with the merger agreement, the financing or the merger or the
transactions contemplated by the financing,

and (ii) no financing source shall be subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature.

Governing Law

        The merger agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would cause the application of the law of
any other jurisdiction, except that any claim, controversy or dispute of any kind or nature to which a financing source is a party that is in any way related to the merger agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated thereby shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

No Third-Party Beneficiaries

        The merger agreement is not intended to and does not confer upon any person, other than the parties to the merger agreement and, as to certain provisions, the financing
sources, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of the merger agreement, other than as described under "—Director and Officer Indemnification and
Insurance" and "—Treatment of Company Equity Awards."

VOTING AGREEMENT 

        This section describes the material terms of the voting agreement. The description in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the complete text of the voting agreement, which is attached as Annex B and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. This summary does not purport to be
complete and may not contain all of the information about the voting agreement that is important to you. This section is not intended to provide you with any factual information
about the Company or Virtu. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and in the public filings the Company makes with the SEC, as described in "Where
You Can Find More Information."

        As a condition and inducement to the willingness of Virtu and Merger Sub to enter into the merger agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger
agreement, Virtu and Merger Sub entered into a voting agreement with Jefferies, which beneficially owned approximately 23.4% of the outstanding Company common stock as
of the record date. The voting agreement requires Jefferies to be present (in person or by proxy) and vote all of the Company common stock that Jefferies is entitled to vote at the
special meeting or any other meeting of the Company's stockholders, and at any adjournment thereof, in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger. Jefferies also agreed to vote all of its Company common stock against any action or agreement that
would result in a material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the merger agreement, or of
Jefferies contained in the voting agreement. Jefferies has also agreed to vote all of its Company common stock against any takeover proposal or any proposal relating to any
takeover proposal and any other corporate action that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, adversely affect or prevent the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the voting agreement, the performance by the Company of its obligations under the merger agreement or the
performance by Jefferies of its obligations under the voting agreement, including any (i) extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation, share exchange or
other business combination involving the Company (other than the merger), (ii) a sale, lease or transfer of any material amount of assets of the Company or reorganization,
recapitalization or liquidation of the Company or (iii) any change in the present capitalization of the Company or any amendment or other change to the Company's certificate of
incorporation or bylaws.

        Jefferies also waived, and agreed not to exercise or assert, any appraisal or similar rights (including under Section 262 of the DGCL) in connection with the merger.

        Jefferies agreed that it will not (i) create or permit any encumbrance (other than certain permitted encumbrances) on its Company common stock, (ii) transfer, sell (including
short sell), assign, gift, hedge, pledge, grant a participation interest in, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any derivative arrangement with respect to (collectively,
"Transfer"), its Company common stock, (iii) enter into any contract with respect to any Transfer, (iv) grant or permit the grant of any proxy, power-of-attorney or other
authorization or consent in or with respect to its Company common stock, (v) deposit or permit the deposit of any of its shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement
or arrangement with respect to its Company common stock or (vi) take or permit any other action that would restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of Jefferies'
obligations under the voting agreement in any material respect.

        The voting agreement will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the consummation of the merger and (ii) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its
terms. The voting agreement will remain in force and effect following a Company adverse recommendation change. Jefferies will also have the right to terminate its voting
agreement if the terms of the merger agreement are amended to reduce the consideration payable to Jefferies or otherwise materially and adversely

APPRAISAL RIGHTS 

        If the merger agreement is adopted by Company stockholders, Company stockholders who do not vote in favor of the merger proposal and who properly demand appraisal
of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.

        The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262
of the DGCL, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a
recommendation that Company stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Only a holder of record of shares of Company common stock is
entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder's name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Company common stock held of record in the
name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other holder of record, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a
timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Company common stock through a bank, broker or other holder of record and you wish to exercise appraisal
rights, you should consult with the record holder of your shares.

        Under Section 262 of the DGCL, Company stockholders who (i) do not vote in favor of the merger proposal, (ii) are the record holders of such shares on the date on which
they make a demand for appraisal and continue to hold such shares through the effective time and (iii) otherwise follow exactly the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the "fair value" of such shares, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value, if any (subject to
proportionate reduction for any consideration paid to such stockholders prior to such determination), as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. For further information,
see "Appraisal Rights—Determination of Fair Value."

        Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the
meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This
proxy statement constitutes the Company's notice to its stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 of the
DGCL is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. In connection with the merger, any Company stockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to
preserve such holder's right to do so, should review Annex D carefully.

        Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A
stockholder who loses its, his or her appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration described in the merger agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity
of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Company common stock, the Company believes that, if a stockholder considers exercising such rights,
such stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

        Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Company common stock must do ALL of the following:

• the stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal. Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but does not otherwise contain voting instructions
will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, a Company stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights must vote against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, abstain or not vote its shares;

Table of Contents

• the stockholder must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting; 

• the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time. A stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the
stockholder transfers the shares before the effective time; and 

• the stockholder or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares
within 120 days after the effective time. If no party files such petition for appraisal within 120 days after the effective time, then the stockholder will lose its right
to an appraisal of its shares of Company common stock. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.

Filing Written Demand 

        Any Company stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to the Company, before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting
at which the merger proposal will be submitted to the Company stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder's shares, and that stockholder must not submit
a blank proxy or vote in favor of the merger proposal. A Company stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand
for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time. A Company stockholder must not submit a blank proxy or vote in favor of the
merger proposal. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the merger proposal, and it will constitute a waiver
of the Company stockholder's right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a Company stockholder who submits a proxy
and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the merger proposal or abstain from voting on the merger proposal.
Neither voting against the merger proposal nor abstaining from voting on the merger proposal will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the merger proposal. A proxy or vote
against the merger proposal will not constitute a demand. A stockholder's failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the merger proposal at the special
meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

        Only a holder of record of shares of Company common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder's name. A demand for appraisal in
respect of shares of Company common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the holder
and state that the holder intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder's shares in connection with the merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as
by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a
joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more
joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in
executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.

        Stockholders who hold their shares in bank or brokerage accounts or other nominee forms, and who wish to exercise appraisal rights, should consult with their banks,
brokers and other holders of record, as applicable, to determine the appropriate procedures for such record holder to make a demand for appraisal of those shares. A person
having a beneficial interest in shares held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other holder of record, must act promptly to

cause the record holder to follow properly and in a timely manner the steps necessary to perfect appraisal rights. Shares held through banks, brokerage firms and other financial
institutions are frequently deposited with and held of record in the name of a nominee of a central security depository, such as Cede & Co., The Depository Trust Company's
nominee. Any beneficial holder of shares desiring to exercise appraisal rights with respect to such shares that are held through a bank, brokerage firm or other financial institution
is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is made by the record holder. The stockholder should instruct such bank, brokerage firm or other financial institution that
the demand for appraisal must be made by the record holder of the shares, which might be the name of a central security depositary if the shares have been so deposited.

        A record owner, such as a bank or broker, who holds shares of Company common stock as a nominee for others may exercise its, his or her right of appraisal with respect to
the shares of Company common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should
state the number of shares of Company common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of Company common stock is expressly mentioned, the
demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Company common stock held in the name of the record owner.

        All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be mailed or delivered to:

KCG Holdings, Inc.
300 Vesey Street

New York, NY 10282
Telephone: (646) 682-6000
Attn: Corporate Secretary

        Any Company stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined an appraisal proceeding as a named party may withdraw its, his or her demand for
appraisal and accept the merger consideration by delivering to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal within 60 days after the effective time.
However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective time will require written approval of the surviving corporation. No appraisal
proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such
terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; however, such dismissal will not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding, or
joined that proceeding as a named party, to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger within 60 days after the effective
time.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation 

        If the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time, the surviving corporation will notify each Company stockholder who has made a written demand for
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and who has not voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, that the merger has become effective and the
effective date thereof.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal 

        Within 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any Company stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is
entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on
the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal.
The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present

intention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of
Company common stock. Accordingly, any Company stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in
respect of their shares of Company common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL. The failure of a Company stockholder to file such a
petition within the period specified in Section 262 of the DGCL could nullify the stockholder's previous written demand for appraisal.

        Within 120 days after the effective time, any Company stockholder who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written
request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger proposal and with respect to which the
Company has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation must mail this statement to the requesting
stockholder within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal,
whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition seeking
appraisal or request from the surviving corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.

        If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a Company stockholder and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be
obligated, within 20 days after such service, to file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses
of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders
as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the court is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262
of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their
shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to
comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss such stockholder from the proceedings.

Determination of Fair Value 

        After determining the Company stockholders entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the "fair value" of the shares of Company common stock,
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the
fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, interest from the effective time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount
rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry
of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each Company stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue after
such payment only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and
(2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP,  Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining
fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and
otherwise admissible in court" should be considered, and that "[f]air price obviously requires

consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company." The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise, and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw
any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor,  Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not
encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the
Delaware Supreme Court also stated that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger
and not the product of speculation, may be considered."

        Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the
same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262
of the DGCL. Although the Company believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger
consideration. Neither the Company nor Virtu anticipates offering more than the merger consideration to any Company stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of the
Company and Virtu reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the "fair value" of a share of Company common stock
is less than the merger consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease.

        The costs of the appraisal proceedings may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems
equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a
stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro-rata against the value of all the
shares entitled to be appraised.

        If any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares of Company common stock under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such
holder's right to appraisal, the stockholder's shares of Company common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time into the right to receive the merger
consideration, less applicable withholding taxes. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder's right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed
within 120 days after the effective time or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the holder's demand for appraisal and an acceptance of
the merger consideration in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

        From and after the effective time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of Company common stock for any purpose, or to
receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder's shares of Company common stock, if any, payable to
Company stockholders of record as of a time prior to the effective time; however, if no petition for an appraisal is filed, or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation
a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the effective time or thereafter with the written approval of the
surviving corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the
appraisal proceeding may not be

dismissed as to any stockholder who commenced the proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval of the court.

        Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of a stockholder's statutory appraisal rights.
Consequently, any Company stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights. To the
extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL, Section 262 of the DGCL will govern.

ADVISORY VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION FOR THE
COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 

        This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for each named executive officer of the Company that is based
on or otherwise relates to the merger. This compensation is referred to as "golden parachute" compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use
such term to describe the merger-related compensation payable to our named executive officers. The "golden parachute" compensation payable to these individuals is subject to a
non-binding, advisory vote of the Company's stockholders, as described below in this section. None of Virtu's named executive officers will receive any compensatory payments
or benefits that constitute "golden parachute" compensation within the meaning of Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K.

• The estimated value of the payments and benefits that the Company's named executive officers will receive in connection with the merger is quantified below in
accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K. The estimated values are based on (i) an assumption that the completion of the merger occurs on May 10, 2017
(the latest practicable date determined in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K); (ii) a per share merger consideration of $20.00; (iii) salary and target
bonus levels as of the date of this proxy statement; (iv) the number of unvested Company equity awards held by the named executive officers as of May 24, 2017,
and (v) a qualifying termination of each named executive officer's employment immediately after the completion of the merger (or, for Mr. Allison, a termination
of his employment where the Company elects to pay his base salary over a six-month period instead of giving advance notice of such termination).

        Depending on when the merger occurs, certain Company equity awards that are now unvested and included in the table below may vest independent of the merger pursuant
to their terms based on continued service with the Company. In addition, the amounts indicated below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of the merger. As a result, the
actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below. All dollar amounts have been rounded to the nearest
whole dollar.

        Accordingly, the Company is requesting stockholders to adopt the following resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis:

        "RESOLVED, that the compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers, in connection with the merger, and the
agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation will or may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in 'Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for the Company's Named Executive Officers—Golden Parachute Compensation,' are hereby
APPROVED."

        Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and the vote with respect to this proposal is advisory only and will not be binding on the Company
or Virtu. If the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to the Company's named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms
of the compensation agreements and arrangements even if Company common stockholders fail to approve the advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation.

        The Company board recommends that Company common stockholders vote "FOR" the compensation proposal.

        In the merger, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, except for specified shares held by the Company or
owned by Virtu or Merger Sub and shares of Company common stock held by Company stockholders who properly exercise dissenters' rights, shall be converted into the right to
receive $20.00 in cash without interest. The merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 12.7% over $17.74, the closing price of Company common stock on the
NYSE on April 19, 2017, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger agreement, and a premium of approximately 45.7% over $13.73, the closing price

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK 

        Company common stock is currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol "KCG." If the merger is completed, Company common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and
deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of Company common stock.

OTHER MATTERS 

        The Company does not know of any business to be presented for action at the special meeting other than those items referred to herein. If any other matters properly come
before the special meeting or any adjournment thereof, it is intended that the proxies will be voted in respect thereof by and at the discretion of the persons named as proxies on
the proxy card.

IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING DELIVERY OF SECURITY HOLDER DOCUMENTS 

        The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as banks and brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirement for proxy materials with respect to two
or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single copy of the proxy materials addressed to all stockholders at that address, unless the affected stockholder has
provided contrary instructions to such company or intermediary, as applicable. This process is commonly known as "householding." To conserve resources and reduce expenses,
we consolidate materials under these rules when possible.

        Certain brokerage firms, banks or similar entities holding Company common stock for their customers may household notices or proxy materials. Stockholders sharing an
address whose shares of our common stock are held in "street name" should contact their broker if they wish to receive separate copies of these materials in the future or if they
are receiving multiple copies and wish to receive only one copy per household in the future. The Company will also promptly deliver a separate copy of the notice or proxy
materials if you contact us at the following address or telephone number: KCG Holdings, Inc., Investor Relations, 300 Vesey Street, New York, NY 10282, telephone (646) 682-
6000.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        If the merger is consummated, we will not have public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meeting of stockholders. However, if the merger is
not consummated, we expect to resume our annual meetings of stockholders and will provide notice of or otherwise publicly disclose the date on which our first such meeting
will be held. If we have public stockholders at the time of our 2018 annual meeting, the following deadlines apply to the submission of stockholder proposals.

        Any stockholder who meets the requirements of the proxy rules under the Exchange Act may submit to the Company board proposals to be considered for submission to the
stockholders at, and included in the proxy materials for, any future annual meetings we may hold. To be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement for any such future
annual meetings, stockholder proposals, submitted in accordance with the SEC's Rule 14a-8, must generally be received by the Company's Corporate Secretary, at the Company's
principal office at 300 Vesey Street, New York, NY 10282, at least 120 days before the date of the Company's proxy statement for the previous year's annual meeting. However,
where, as here, the Company did not have an annual meeting during the previous year, or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the date of
the previous year's annual meeting, stockholder proposals must be received by the Company's Corporate Secretary a reasonable amount of time before the Company begins to
print and mail its proxy materials in order to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement for any such future annual meeting.

        The Company bylaws provide an advance notice procedure for a stockholder to properly bring business before an annual meeting or to nominate any person for election to
the Company board. To be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement for any such future annual meetings, notice by the stockholder must generally be received by the
Company's Corporate Secretary not less than 90 days and not more than 120 days prior to the anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of
stockholders. In the event where, as here, the Company did not have an annual meeting during the previous year, or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more
than 30 days from the date of the previous year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the
tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever
first occurs.

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES 

        Section 3.1    Merger Consideration.     

        (a)   Except (1) as otherwise provided in Section 3.1(c) or (2) for Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined), at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder of any Merger Sub Common Stock or of any Company Capital Stock or Company Warrants:

          (i)  each share of Company Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive $20.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"); and

         (ii)  pursuant to Section 2.6 of the Warrant Agreement and notwithstanding anything contained therein to the contrary, at the Effective Time, with respect to
each Company Warrant that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the right of the holder of such Company Warrant to receive shares of
Company Class A Common Stock upon exercise of such Company Warrant shall thereafter convert to the right of the holder of such Company Warrant to exercise
such Company Warrant to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such
Company Warrant and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the then-current exercise price per share of Company Class A Common Stock
(without giving effect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby) previously subject to such Company Warrant (such amount being hereafter referred to as the
"Warrant Consideration"). The Warrant Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement.

        (b)   Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be converted into and
become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, all certificates
representing common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which
they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

        (c)   At the Effective Time, each share of Company Capital Stock held by the Company as treasury stock (other than shares in a Company Plan) or owned by Parent
or Merger Sub (other than shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are
beneficially owned by third parties) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

        Section 3.2    Cancellation of Company Class A Common Stock.     At the Effective Time, all of the outstanding Company Class A Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist. Certificates representing such shares of Company Class A Common Stock, if any, prior to the Effective

provided under this Article III.

        Section 3.3    Company Equity Awards.     

        (a)   At the Effective Time, (i) each then-outstanding option to purchase Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan (each, a "Company Stock
Option") that is then-unvested or unexercisable shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full contingent upon the Closing, and (ii) unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by Parent and a holder of Company Stock Options prior to the Effective Time, all Company Stock Options that are outstanding and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company Stock Option shall be entitled to
receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Stock Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (A) the
total number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option (such amount being hereafter referred to as the "Option
Consideration"). From and after the Effective Time, there shall be outstanding no Company Stock Options and the former holders thereof shall be entitled only to the
payment of the Option Consideration, if any. Any Company Stock Option with respect to which the exercise price is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration
shall be cancelled for no consideration.

        (b)   At the Effective Time, (i) each then-outstanding stock appreciation right with respect to shares of Company Class A Common Stock granted under the Company
Stock Plan (each, a "Company SAR") that is then-unvested or unexercisable shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full contingent upon the Closing, and
(ii) unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and a holder of Company SARs prior to the Effective Time, all Company SARs that are outstanding and unexercised
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company SAR shall be entitled to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such Company SAR and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares
of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Company SAR and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company
Class A Common Stock subject to such Company SAR (such amount being hereafter referred to as the "SAR Consideration"). From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be outstanding no Company SARs and the former holders thereof shall be entitled only to the payment of the SAR Consideration, if any. Any Company SAR with
respect to which the exercise price is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled for no consideration.

        (c)   At the Effective Time (i) each then-outstanding restricted stock unit with respect to shares of Company Class A Common Stock outstanding under the Company
Stock Plan ("RSUs") shall become immediately vested in full contingent upon the Closing, and (ii) unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parent and the holder of
such vested RSU prior to the Effective Time each outstanding vested RSU (including those RSUs that vest by reason of the consummation of the transaction) shall be
cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company RSU shall be entitled to receive in consideration of the cancellation of such Company
RSU and in settlement therefore, a payment in cash of amount equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of shares of Company Class A
Common Stock underlying the cancelled vested RSU.

three (3) Business Days (at Parent's option, through the Company's payroll system or through the Paying Agent (defined below)). Parent and Merger Sub shall ensure that
the Surviving Corporation has an amount in cash sufficient to pay all amounts required by the foregoing sentence. The Company Board (or appropriate committee
thereof) shall pass resolutions and take all other such action as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the treatment of Company Stock Options, Company SARs and
RSUs (collectively, the "Company Equity Awards") as contemplated by this Section 3.3 to the effect that (i) all awards issued under the Company Stock Plan shall be
settled as of the Effective Time as contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the Company Stock Plan shall be terminated as of the Effective Time and (iii) neither any holder
of Company Equity Awards, nor any other participant in the Company Stock Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any securities of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, or to receive any payment or benefit with respect to any award previously granted under the Company Stock Plan, except as provided in this
Section 3.3.

        Section 3.4    Surrender and Payment.     

        (a)   At or promptly after (but in no event later than 2 Business Days following) the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a
paying agent selected by Parent (subject to the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, of the Company) (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of
(i) certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Class A Common Stock (the "Certificates") and (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Class A Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"), for exchange in accordance with this Article III, cash in an amount equal to the aggregate amounts
payable under Section 3.1(a)(i); provided that such amount shall be increased by any amount that shall become payable by the Paying Agent to the holders of Company
Equity Awards pursuant to Parent's election under the first sentence of Section 3.3(d). As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Effective Time, Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of shares of Company Class A Common Stock at the Effective
Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent) for use in such exchange. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation
or transfer of Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Class A Common Stock formerly represented by any such Certificate and such
Certificate so surrendered and the shares of Company Class A Common Stock formerly represented by any such Uncertificated Shares shall forthwith be cancelled.

        (b)   Each holder of shares of Company Class A Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the
Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the
Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Class A Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the
case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

        (c)   If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly

endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay
to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

        (d)   At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of Company Capital Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with, the procedures set forth in this Article III.

        (e)   Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to (a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company
Class A Common Stock nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be paid, at the request of Parent, to or as directed by Parent, and any such holder who has not
exchanged shares of Company Class A Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.4 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of the Acquirer Parties,
the Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Class A Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

        Section 3.5    Adjustments.     If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company Class A
Common Stock shall occur, including as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding for the avoidance of doubt any change that results from (a) any exercise of options outstanding as of the date hereof
to purchase shares of Company Class A Common Stock granted under the Company's stock option or compensation plans or arrangements, (b) any exercise of Company
Warrants or (c) any vesting of Company Equity Awards, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

        Section 3.6    Lost Certificates.     If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

        Section 3.7    Dissenting Shares.     Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), shares
of Company Class A Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Class A Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(c)) and that are held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing
and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") will not
be convertible into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment
under DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they
had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the Surviving

Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisals, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of DGCL
and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Shares, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and
demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle, compromise, offer to
settle or compromise, or otherwise negotiate any such demands.

        Section 3.8    Withholding.     Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under all applicable Tax
Laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the recipient of the payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, no Claim with respect to any Company Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) by the Department of Labor, the IRS or any other
Governmental Authority or by any plan participant or beneficiary is pending or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, relating to the Company Plans, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company Plans nor, to the Knowledge of the

Laws). Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not resulted or would not reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the Company

Code or other applicable Laws, in each case, as related to the Company Plans.

Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger (an "Acquirer Material Adverse Effect"). Parent has made available to the Company complete and correct copies of the

information reasonably requested by the Company to be included therein. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all substantive correspondence between it and
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve as promptly as reasonably practicable
any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement or response (including the proposed final version of the Proxy Statement or response), (ii) shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent, and (iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

        (b)   If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to Parent, or any change occurs with respect to other information supplied by the Acquirer Parties
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Parent shall promptly notify the
Company of such event, and the Company and the Acquirer Parties shall cooperate in the prompt filing by the Company with the SEC of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement and, if required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Company's stockholders.

        (c)   If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to the Company, or any change occurs with respect to other information supplied by the Company
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly notify
Parent of such event, and the Company and the Acquirer Parties shall cooperate in the prompt filing by the Company with the SEC of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement and, if required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Company's stockholders.

        (d)   The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders and to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date the
Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC and (ii) subject to Section 7.4, solicit the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall, through the Company Board,
recommend to its stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval (the "Company Board Recommendation") and shall include such Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, except to the extent that the Company Board shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by
Section 7.4. The Company agrees that its obligations to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal or by the making of any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change by the Company Board and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation. Without limiting the foregoing, if the Company
Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, then the Company Board shall submit this Agreement to the Company's stockholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to

the Company's stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by Applicable Law. The Company shall not
adjourn, postpone or recess the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent which shall not be unreasonably withheld and, unless there
shall have been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, shall adjourn, postpone or recess such meeting as directed by Parent in order to obtain a quorum or to
solicit additional votes (in each case so long as such meeting is not adjourned, postponed or recessed to a date that is later than the earlier of the Outside Date). In addition
to the foregoing, the Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Company Takeover Proposal other than the Merger.

        (e)   As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent will prepare and file with the SEC an information statement of the type
contemplated by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act related to the Equity Financing (such documents, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the
"14C Information Statement"). Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the 14C Information Statement as promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt thereof and to have the 14C Information Statement cleared by the staff of the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
filing. Parent agrees to correct any information contained in the 14C Information Statement which is or becomes false or misleading. Parent will as soon as reasonably
practicable notify the Company of receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the 14C Information Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment
to the 14C Information Statement or for additional information and will provide the Company with copies of all such comments and correspondence. Prior to filing or
mailing the 14C Information Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect
thereto, Parent will provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response. Promptly after Parent has resolved
all comments to the 14C Information Statement to the satisfaction of the SEC staff or after ten (10) calendar days have passed since the date of filing of the preliminary
14C Information Statement with the SEC without notice from the SEC of its intent to review the 14C Information Statement, Parent will promptly file with the SEC the
14C Information Statement in definitive form as contemplated by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act substantially in the form previously cleared or filed
with the SEC, as the case may be, and cause a copy of the 14C Information Statement to be mailed to each stockholder of Parent. The Company agrees to correct any
information provided by it for use in the 14C Information Statement which is or becomes false or misleading. Prior to mailing such statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto), Parent will provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document.

        (f)    The Company shall provide written notice to Parent of the record date in respect of the Company Stockholder Meeting no fewer than twelve (12) days prior to
such date.

        Section 7.2     Regulatory Actions; Reasonable Best Efforts.     

        (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable, the Merger, and to cooperate with the
other in connection with the foregoing, including using its reasonable best efforts, in each case in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (i) to obtain all consents, approvals, rulings or authorizations that are required to be obtained under any Requirement of Law (including any Required
Governmental Approvals), (ii) to obtain any consents required from third parties and to deliver any negative consent letters, (iii) to lift or rescind any injunction or
restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the Parties hereto to consummate the Merger, and

Governmental Authority, if any. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than fifteen (15) days after the date of this
Agreement (subject to, in the case of the Acquirer Parties, the reasonable cooperation of the Company, and in the case of the Company, the reasonable cooperation of the
Acquirer Parties, in each case in accordance with this Section 7.2(a)) each of the Acquirer Parties and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
prepare and file any applications, notices and filings required to be filed with any regulatory agency in order to obtain the Required Governmental Approvals. Each of the
Acquirer Parties and the Company shall use, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain each such Required Governmental
Approvals as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of the Acquirer Parties and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable,
each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties
hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The Parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and each Party will keep the other Parties apprised promptly of the status of filings and applications, including communications with Governmental
Authorities that cause such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Required Government Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any
such approval will be delayed, and all other matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party shall consult with the other Parties in
advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        (b)   Further, and without limiting the generality of the rest of this Section 7.2, each of the Parties shall promptly (i) furnish to the other such necessary Information
and reasonable assistance as the other Party may request in connection with the foregoing, and (ii) subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of Information,
provide counsel for the other Party with copies of all filings made by such Party, and all correspondence between such Party (and its advisors) with any Governmental
Authority and any other Information supplied by such Party and such Party's Subsidiaries to a Governmental Authority or received from such a Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements.

        (c)   In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties contained in this Section 7.2, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, and cause its
Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts to take, all steps as may be necessary to obtain all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances,
waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals under applicable Antitrust Law (collectively, "Antitrust Clearances"), including making an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Merger as soon as practicable after the date hereof, and in any event
within fifteen (15) days following the date of this Agreement, and using their reasonable best efforts to supply as soon as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and using their reasonable best efforts to take any others actions as may be required to obtain such
Antitrust Clearances or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any decrees, judgments, injunctions or orders under any Antitrust Laws that
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the Merger; provided, that Parent shall not be required to take, and shall not be
required to cause its Affiliates to take, any action that would result in a material adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation and Acquirer Parties on a combined basis
after the Merger.

        (d)   At Parent's request and expense, the Company agrees to take all actions Parent reasonably deems prudent in order to obtain or assist Parent in obtaining any
actions, consents, undertakings, approvals or waivers by or from any Person for or in connection with, and to reasonably assist Parent in litigating or otherwise contesting
any objections to or proceedings or other actions challenging, the consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.2(c) shall obligate the
Company to take any action that is not (i) conditioned on the consummation of the Merger and (ii) at the expense of Parent.

        (e)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all obligations of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing shall be governed
exclusively by Section 7.11 and not this Section 7.2.

        Section 7.3    Access to Information; Confidentiality.     

        (a)   Upon reasonable notice and subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the Acquirer Parties access, for the purpose of preparing for the integration of the
operations of the Company and Parent and the Merger and other matters contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, during normal business hours during
the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives, in each case in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the Acquirer Parties (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of the federal securities Laws or federal or state banking, mortgage lending, real estate or consumer
finance or protection Laws (other than reports or documents which the Company is not permitted to disclose under Applicable Law or that are publicly filed) and (ii) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of preparing for the integration of the operations of
the Company and Parent and the Merger and other matters contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, violate any contract or agreement or contravene any
Law; and in any such event, the parties hereto will use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

        (b)   All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered
into between the Company and Parent, dated March 17, 2017 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

        (c)   No investigation by any of the parties or their respective representatives shall constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the others set forth herein.

        Section 7.4    No Solicitation by the Company; the Company Board Recommendation.     

        (a)   Except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 7.4, the Company shall not, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates or any of its or their
respective officers, directors or employees, agents, affiliates and representatives (including any investment bankers, attorneys or accountants retained by it or any of its
Affiliates) (collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate (including by way of providing
information) any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to result in a Company Takeover Proposal,

Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to result in a Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, (iv) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, asset or share purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related
to any Company Takeover Proposal (an "Acquisition Agreement"), (v) enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder, or (vi) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Company Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to result in a Company Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such
Person or its Representatives.

        (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal, which was not preceded by, or resulting from, any
breach of this Section 7.4, that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors) constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Company Proposal, the Company may, subject to compliance with Section 7.4(f), prior to (but not after)
the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL, take any action described in
clauses (x) and (y) below, to the extent that the Company Board concludes in good faith (and following consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to take such
actions would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law: (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives and any financing sources) pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, so long as any material non-public information provided under this clause has previously been provided to the Acquirer Parties or is provided to the Acquirer
Parties substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate in discussions regarding the terms of such Company Takeover Proposal
and the negotiation of such terms with the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and such Person's Representatives and any financing sources); provided, that
the Company shall within 24 hours provide Parent with any information with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries provided to such Person which was not
previously provided to Parent (or its representatives). The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate, waive, amend, modify or fail to use
reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing standstill, confidentiality or similar obligations owed by any Person to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
outstanding agreement relating to a potential acquisition of the Company or any material portion of its assets, in each case except to the extent necessary to permit the
Company to take an action it is otherwise permitted to take under this Section 7.4(b) in full compliance with such provision; provided, that the Company (on behalf of
itself and any of its Subsidiaries) hereby waives any such standstill obligation to the extent necessary to permit a Person otherwise covered by such standstill to submit a
confidential unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal to the Company Board. For purposes of clarification, the taking of any of the actions contemplated
by clause (x) or (y) of this Section 7.4(b) shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Company Takeover Proposal, (C) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to

Board Recommendation at the request of Parent within ten (10) Business Days or (ii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing (each being referred to as a "Company
Adverse Recommendation Change").

        (d)   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Company Board may, prior to (but not after) the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of shares of Company
Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (x) in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written Company Takeover Proposal, the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal and, with regard to financial matters, its financial advisors)
that such unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Company Proposal and following consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable
Law, or (y) other than in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, an event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that affects the business, assets or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries that is unknown to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement becomes known to the Company Board (an
"Intervening Event") prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL
and the Company Board has concluded in good faith, following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change is reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change until after the fifth (5th) Business Day (the "Recommendation Change Notice Period")
following Parent's receipt of written notice (a "Company Notice of Recommendation Change") from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take
such action, including the details of the Intervening Event or, in the case of a Superior Company Proposal, the terms and conditions of any Superior Company Proposal
that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board and the identity of the party making such Superior Company Proposal, and, if applicable, shall have
contemporaneously provided a copy of all of the relevant proposed transaction agreements and any other documents provided by, or correspondence with, the party
making such Superior Company Proposal, including the then-current form of the definitive agreements with respect to such Superior Company Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term of such Superior Company Proposal or change to the material facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event shall require a new Company Notice of Recommendation Change and trigger a new Recommendation Change Notice Period). The Company Board
may not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of a

Superior Company Proposal if any such Superior Company Proposal resulted from a breach by the Company of this Section 7.4.

        (e)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall take into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent in response to a Company Notice of Recommendation Change or otherwise; provided, that the
Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Recommendation Change Notice Period and prior to any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent also seeks to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that (i) in the event of a Company Notice of Recommendation Change in respect of a Superior Company Proposal, this Agreement results
in a transaction that is no less favorable to the stockholders of the Company than any Company Takeover Proposal that would be deemed to constitute a Superior
Company Proposal in the absence of such adjustments or (ii) in the event of a Company Notice of Recommendation change in respect of an Intervening Event, the
Company Board would no longer be required to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in order not to be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law, and, in the event Parent agrees to make such adjustments to the Agreement in either case of clause (i) or
(ii) above, as applicable, no Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made.

        (f)    In addition to the foregoing obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 7.4, the Company shall within 24 hours of the receipt thereof, advise Parent
orally of any Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of
the Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall (x) keep Parent informed in all material respects and on a reasonably current basis (and in
no event later than 24 hours from the occurrence or existence of any material event, fact or circumstance) of the status and details (including any material change to the
terms thereof) of any Company Takeover Proposal, and (y) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other
written material exchanged between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Takeover Proposal.

        (g)   Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any
other legally required disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure
to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise required under Applicable Law;
provided, that any such statement that would be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall be in accordance with Section 7.4(d) and Section 7.4(e).

Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or (b) which the Notifying Party believes would cause or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of the Notifying Party's representations, warranties or covenants contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually

        Section 7.7    Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.     

        (a)   Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent agrees that all rights, existing as of the date hereof, to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any indemnification, employment
or other similar agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries set forth in Schedule 7.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and
hold harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of the Company of any of its
Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements ("Losses"), incurred or arising in connection
with any claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or
occurring or alleged to have existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby)),
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at
the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person or any act or omission by such Company Indemnified Party while serving
in such capacity, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law. In the event of any such claim,
action, investigation, suit or proceeding, (x) each Company Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim,
action, investigation, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Corporation from the Company
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided, that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the
DGCL, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter. Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 7.7, upon learning of any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Company and, if so learning after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation thereof in
writing; provided, that the failure promptly to so notify in writing shall not affect the obligations of the Surviving Corporation except to the extent, if any, that it is
materially prejudiced by such failure or delay.

        (b)   In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.7.

        (c)   For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (i) cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors'
and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) provide substitute polices for the Company and its
current and former directors and officers (and any individual who becomes an officer or director prior to the Effective Time) who are

either case, of not less than the amount of existing coverage and have other terms and from carriers not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of
any one policy year more than 300% of the annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance for the year ended December 31, 2016 (such 300% amount, the
"Maximum Amount"), and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 7.7 it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for the years within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of such
insurance, prior to the Closing Date, Parent may direct that the Company, in which case the Company shall, purchase a "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the Company and its current and former directors and officers (and any individual who becomes an officer or director
prior to the Effective Time) who are currently (or prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company. In the event the Company purchases such tail coverage, the Surviving Corporation shall cease to have any obligations under the
first sentence of this Section 7.7(c).

        (d)   The provisions of this Section 7.7, (i) shall survive consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
indemnified or insured party (including the Company Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

        Section 7.8    Takeover Laws.     The Parties hereto and their respective boards of directors or other governing bodies shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no
state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and, (ii) if any state
takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

        Section 7.9    Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b).     Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to
cause any disposition or acquisition by the Company's directors and officers of shares of Company Capital Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such
shares of Company Capital Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, including any such actions specified in the applicable SEC No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999.

        Section 7.10    Litigation.     The Company and Parent shall each give the other Party the opportunity to participate at its own expense, to the extent practicable and subject
to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and in a manner that does not result in any waiver or loss of attorney-client privilege, in the defense or settlement of
any litigation relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or any litigation by or
against any holder of Company Notes or lender under the Company Credit Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent which
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

        Section 7.11    Financing.     

        (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate, on a timely basis, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letters on the terms set forth therein (subject to any "flex" provisions applicable to the Debt Financing; provided that such "flex" provisions would not adversely affect
the amount or availability of the Debt Financing). Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters and comply with its
obligations and conditions thereunder, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements on a timely basis with respect to the Financing on terms and conditions (subject
to any "flex" provisions applicable to the Debt Financing; provided that such "flex" provisions would not adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt
Financing) contained in the Commitment Letters or otherwise no less favorable to Parent with respect to timing, amount or conditions than those contained in the
Commitment Letters (the "Financing Agreements"), and (iii) satisfy (or have waived) on a timely basis all conditions and covenants applicable to Parent in the
Commitment Letters that are within its control at or prior to the Closing (including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a
condition to the Debt Financing), and otherwise comply in all material respects with its obligations under the Commitment Letters (including the Financing Agreements).
Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of material developments in respect of Parent's efforts to arrange the Financing, including any changes to the
respective amounts of the Debt Financing and Equity Financing. Prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent shall not agree to, or
permit, any amendment, modification or supplement of, or waiver under, the Commitment Letters to the extent such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver
would (i) reduce the aggregate amount to be funded under the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt
Financing or similar fees) unless (x) in the case of a reduction in the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount or (y) in the case of a
reduction in the Equity Financing, the Debt Financing is increased by a corresponding amount, (ii) amend, modify or supplement the conditions or contingencies to the
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to make it less likely the Financing will be funded or imposes new or additional conditions or expands any
existing condition to the receipt of the Financing at the Closing or (iii) be reasonably expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true and completed copies of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver
(which, in the case of fee letters, may be redacted to omit numerical amounts and certain economic "flex" terms, none of which would adversely affect the amount or
availability of the Debt Financing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Parent may amend the Commitment Letters to add investors, lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letters as of the date hereof and, in connection therewith, amend the economic and other
arrangements with respect to the existing and additional investors, lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities, if the addition of such
additional parties and amendment of additional terms do not adversely impact the aggregate amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing and (y) in the event that
Parent is required pursuant to this Section 7.11 to provide any information that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege, Parent may withhold disclosure of such
information so long as Parent gives notice to the Company of the fact that it is withholding such information and thereafter the Company and Parent shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive the applicable privilege or
protection.

        (b)   In the event any portion of the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions
applicable to the Debt

Financing) contemplated in the Investment Agreements or the Debt Commitment Letters, as applicable, and such portion is necessary to fund the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall promptly notify the Company and shall, (i) with respect to the Equity Financing, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to obtain as promptly as practicable alternative equity
financing from alternative sources for such portion (x) on terms and conditions not materially less favorable to the Company than the Investment Agreements and (y) in
an amount equal to the amount of the Equity Financing and (ii) with respect to the Debt Financing, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to obtain as promptly as practicable alternative debt financing from alternative sources
for such portion (x) on terms and conditions not materially less favorable to Parent than the Debt Commitment Letters and (y) in an amount equal to the amount of the
Debt Financing, such that the amount of alternative financing obtained under (i) and (ii) equals an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger. To the extent that Parent
is unable to obtain any amount of alternative equity financing to replace the Equity Financing, Parent shall draw upon any additional amounts available under the Debt
Financing to cover the shortfall. If obtained, Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true and complete copies of a new equity commitment or a new debt financing
commitment, as applicable, pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent with any portion of the Equity Financing or the Debt
Financing, as applicable. References in this Agreement to (i) the "Equity Financing" shall include the equity financing contemplated by the Investment Agreements as
amended, modified or replaced and references in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
as amended, modified or replaced, (ii) the Investment Agreements and the "Debt Commitment Letters" shall include such documents as amended, modified or replaced
and (iii) "Equity Financing Sources" and "Debt Financing Sources" shall include the providers of equity or debt financing, as applicable, under such documents as
amended, modified or replaced (in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), including replacement with alternative financing and alternative equity or debt financing
commitments (as applicable) pursuant to this Section 7.11 from and after such amendment, modification or replacement); provided, that fee letters or side letters which do
not contain "flex" or other provisions which affect the terms or conditions of the Debt Financing shall not be required to be provided.

        (c)   Parent acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing or any alternate Financing pursuant to Section 7.11(b) is not a condition to the Closing and
reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any
alternative Financing.

        (d)   The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to provide, to Parent such reasonable
cooperation that is customary in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including by using its reasonable best
efforts to (i) upon reasonable advance notice, cause members of senior management and the Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be available to
participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and sessions with ratings agencies, in each case in
connection with the Debt Financing, (ii) furnish as promptly as reasonably practicable to the Parent and the Debt Financing Sources the Required Information as to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and assist the Parent with the preparation of customary materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing (the "Offering Documents"), in each case

case may be, to be satisfied if such Party's breach of any provision of this Agreement, failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or failure to consummate the

this Agreement. If any involuntary Transfer of any of the Stockholder's Subject Shares in the Company shall occur (including, but not limited to, a sale by the Stockholder's
trustee in any bankruptcy, or a sale to a purchaser at any creditor's or court sale), the transferee (which term, as used herein, shall include any and all transferees and subsequent

Subject Shares that may arise with respect to the Merger.

without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), except as may be required by applicable Law (provided that reasonable notice of, and
an opportunity to review and comment on (which comments shall be considered by the Stockholder in good faith), any such disclosure will be provided to Parent). The
Stockholder consents to and hereby authorizes the Acquirer Parties to publish and disclose in all documents and schedules filed with the SEC, and each press release or other
disclosure document that any Acquirer Party reasonably determines to be necessary in connection with the Merger, the Stockholder's identity and ownership of the Subject
Shares, the existence of this Agreement, the nature of the Stockholder's commitments and obligations under this Agreement and any other information that Parent reasonably
determines is required to be disclosed by Law, and the Stockholder acknowledges that the Acquirer Parties may, in Parent's sole discretion, file this Agreement or a form hereof
with the SEC or any other Governmental Authority (provided that, in each circumstance described in this sentence, the Acquirer Parties shall provide the Stockholder with
reasonable notice of, and an opportunity to review and comment on such disclosure (which comments shall be considered by Acquirer Parties in good faith). The Stockholder
agrees to promptly provide Parent any information it may reasonably require for the preparation of any such disclosure documents, and the Stockholder agrees to promptly notify
Parent of any required corrections with respect to any information supplied by the Stockholder specifically for use in any such disclosure document, if and to the extent that any

Company affecting the Subject Shares, the terms of this Agreement shall apply to the resulting securities.

        4.5    Stock Loan Agreements.    Parent shall provide the Stockholder at least five (5) calendar days' notice of the record date of the Company Stockholder Meeting (or for
any other vote or consent subject to Section 1.1 hereof), and subject to and following the Stockholder's receipt of such notice, the Stockholder shall cause the Stockholder's
Subject Shares to not be subject to any restrictions under the Stock Loan Agreements as of such record date or dates that would prevent the Stockholder from voting the Subject
Shares in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement, the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, or any other matters subject to Section 1.1
hereof, all in accordance with the terms hereof.

ARTICLE V
MISCELLANEOUS

the notice or other communication is sent to the address, facsimile number or email address set forth (i) if to an Acquirer Party, to the address, facsimile number or e-mail address
set forth in Section 10.3 of the Merger Agreement and (ii) if to the Stockholder, to the Stockholder's address, facsimile number or email address set forth on a signature page
hereto, or to such other address, facsimile number or e-mail address as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to each other party hereto.

        5.2    Termination.    This Agreement shall terminate automatically, without any notice or other action by any Person, upon the first to occur of (a) the termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (b) the Effective Time, (c) any amendment to the Merger Agreement which reduces the consideration payable to the stockholder
or otherwise materially and adversely impacts the Stockholder, or (d) the termination of this Agreement by written notice from Parent to the Stockholder (the period from the date
hereof through such time being referred to as the "Agreement Period"). Upon termination of this Agreement, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities under this
Agreement; provided, however, that (x) nothing set forth in this Section 5.2 shall relieve any party from liability for any Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to termination
hereof and (y) the provisions of this Article V shall survive any termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement does not terminate upon a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Merger Agreement is terminated. "Willful Breach" means with respect to any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant set
forth in this Agreement, an intentional action or omission by a party that both (i) causes such party to be in breach of such representation, warranty, agreement or covenant and
(ii) such party knows at the time of such intentional action or omission is or would constitute a breach, or would reasonably be expected to result in a breach, of such
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant.

        5.3    Amendments and Waivers.    Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

        5.12    Counterparts.    This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which, taken together, shall constitute

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL 

April 20, 2017

Board of Directors
KCG Holdings, Inc.

New York, NY 10282

Ladies and Gentlemen:

        You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Virtu Financial, Inc. ("Virtu") and its affiliates) of the outstanding
shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of KCG Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") of the $20.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 20, 2017 (the "Agreement"), by and among Virtu, Orchestra Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Virtu, and the Company.

        Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment management and
other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they
manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and
investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Virtu, any of their respective affiliates
and third parties, including Leucadia National Corporation, the parent of a significant shareholder of the Company ("Jefferies"), Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, an affiliate
of a significant shareholder of Virtu ("Temasek"), the Republic of Singapore and its agencies or instrumentalities (collectively, the "Republic of Singapore"), an affiliate of

and have participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in connection with the Transaction, the principal portion
of which is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain

Annex D 

ANNEX D: SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL 

§ 262 Appraisal rights

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to
such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and
who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word
"stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words
"depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251
(other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258,
§ 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class
or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of
stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000
holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not
require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a
constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263
and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or
depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000
holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the
parent immediately prior

to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as
contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as
practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent
corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock
as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and
(g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members
who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section
that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall
deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written
demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of
each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger
or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective
date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of
such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares
of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of
the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of
a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of
mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be

sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's
shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second
notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled
to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or
within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of
a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the
sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's
shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice
that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to
receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that
if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is
given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a)
and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for
appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has
complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or
resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for
appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such
stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such
stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement
described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days
after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have
demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall
be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give
notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list
at the addresses therein

stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of
Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs
thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The
Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal
rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal
rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as
provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over
the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of
the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in
which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to
participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an
appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled
thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates
upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a
stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal

proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an
appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be
entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders
of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided
in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal
and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in
the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems
just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or
consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
