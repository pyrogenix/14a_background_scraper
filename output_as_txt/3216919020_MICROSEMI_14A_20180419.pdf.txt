MICROSEMI CORPORATION 
One Enterprise 

Aliso Viejo, California 92656 
Telephone: (949) 380-6100

April 19, 2018 

Dear Stockholder,

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of common stockholders of Microsemi Corporation, a Delaware corporation (which
we refer to as Microsemi, we or us), to be held at our corporate offices located at One Enterprise, Aliso Viejo, California 92656 on May 22,
2018 at 10:00 a.m., local time.

At the special meeting, our stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement that Microsemi
entered into on March 1, 2018, as it may be amended from time to time (which we refer to as the merger agreement), providing for the
acquisition of Microsemi by Microchip Technology Incorporated (which we refer to as Microchip). The acquisition will occur by means of a
merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Microchip with and into Microsemi (which we refer to as the merger), with Microsemi surviving the
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Microchip. At the special meeting, you will also be asked to consider and vote on (1) a non-binding,
advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Microsemi to its named executive officers in connection with
the merger and (2) a proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, including to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

If the merger agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the merger is completed, each share of our common stock will be converted
into the right to receive $68.78 per share in cash, which represents (i) a premium of approximately 17% to $58.97 per share, the closing stock
price on January 22, 2018, the last full trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential sale transaction involving Microsemi, (ii) a
premium of approximately 22% to $56.33 per share, the six-month volume-weighted average closing price of our common stock as of
March 1, 2018, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement and (iii) a premium of
approximately 7% to $64.30 per share, the closing price of our common stock on March 1, 2018, the last trading day prior to the public
announcement of the execution of the merger agreement.

The board of directors of Microsemi unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger
agreement; (2) “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by Microsemi
to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting from time to
time, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement
at the time of the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

The enclosed proxy statement describes the merger agreement, the merger and related matters, and attaches a copy of the merger
agreement. We urge you to read the proxy statement and its annexes, including the merger agreement, carefully and in their entirety, as they
contain important information.

Your vote is very important. The merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our
common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adoption of the merger agreement. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, we
urge you to submit a proxy to have your shares voted in advance of the special meeting by using one of the methods described in the
accompanying proxy statement.

On behalf of the entire board of directors of Microsemi, thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely,
/s/ James J. Peterson 
James J. Peterson 
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

The proxy statement is dated April 19, 2018, and is first being mailed to our common stockholders on April 20, 2018.

NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS
APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED THE MERGER, PASSED UPON THE MERITS OR FAIRNESS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING THE PROPOSED MERGER, OR PASSED UPON THE
ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE ACCOMPANYING PROXY STATEMENT. ANY
REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
To Be Held on May 22, 2018

To Our Stockholders:

Notice is hereby given that a special meeting of the common stockholders of Microsemi Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (which we refer to as Microsemi, we or us), will be held at our corporate offices located at
One Enterprise, Aliso Viejo, California 92656 on May 22, 2018 at 10:00 a.m., local time, for the following
purposes:

The merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions which would be effected in connection with the
merger are described more fully in the attached proxy statement, and we urge you to read it carefully and in its
entirety.

The board of directors of Microsemi (which we refer to as the Board), has unanimously determined that the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of,
Microsemi and the stockholders of Microsemi and approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Board made its determination after
consultation with its legal and financial advisors and consideration of a number of factors, including those
discussed in the attached proxy statement.

Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. The
proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation arrangements for Microsemi’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.
The proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or in the absence of
a quorum requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or represented
by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Board recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain
compensation arrangements for Microsemi’s named executive officers in connection with the merger and
“FOR” approval of the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting from time to time, if
necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of
the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof to approve the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares of our common stock you own. Because
stockholders cannot take any action at the meeting (other than to adjourn the meeting) unless a majority of our
common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat is represented, it is important that you attend
the meeting in person or are represented by proxy at the meeting. The merger cannot be completed unless the
merger agreement is adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock
entitled to vote thereon. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please complete, date, sign and
return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying postage-paid reply envelope, or
submit your proxy by telephone or the Internet. If your shares of our common stock are held in “street name” by
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will be unable to vote
your shares of our common stock without instructions from you. You should instruct your bank, brokerage firm
or other nominee to vote your shares of our common stock in accordance with the procedures provided by your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee. If you fail to vote in person at the special meeting, fail to return your
proxy card and fail to submit your proxy by telephone or the Internet, or if your shares are held in “street name”
by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee to vote, that will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” approval of the merger proposal.

Stockholders who do not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, and who submit a
written demand for appraisal prior to the special meeting and comply with all other applicable requirements of
Delaware law, which are summarized in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights” in the accompanying proxy
statement (and the Delaware appraisal statute is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement),
will be entitled to rights of appraisal to obtain the fair value of their shares of common stock of Microsemi.

You may revoke your proxy before the special meeting by voting over the Internet or by telephone (only
your latest Internet or telephone vote is counted) or by signing a new proxy and mailing it, in each case, in
accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by sending
us a revocation of proxy or by attending the special meeting and requesting that your proxy be revoked and/or
voting in person; however, attending the special meeting will not revoke your Internet vote, telephone vote or
proxy, as the case may be, unless you specifically request it.

The Board has fixed the close of business on April 10, 2018 as the record date for determination of
stockholders entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any adjournments or
postponements thereof. Only stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date are entitled to
receive notice of, and to vote at (in person or by proxy), the special meeting and at any adjournment or
postponement thereof. You will be entitled to one vote for each share of our common stock that you owned on the
record date. A complete list of our stockholders of record entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available
for inspection at our principal executive offices at least 10 days prior to the date of the special meeting and
continuing through the special meeting for any purpose germane to the meeting. The list will also be available at
the meeting for inspection by any stockholder present at the meeting.

Only stockholders of record (including “street name” stockholders who can show that they beneficially
owned our common stock on the record date), their duly appointed proxy holders and our guests may attend the
special meeting. To gain admittance, please bring the admission ticket with you to the meeting. If your shares of
our common stock are held in “street name” through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, please send a
written request for an admission ticket to our Secretary at One Enterprise, Aliso Viejo, California 92656, Attn:
Secretary. Please include the following information with your request: (i) a signed cover letter stating your name
and complete mailing address, including daytime and evening telephone numbers; that you are requesting an
admission ticket; the number of shares that you own in

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Record Date and Quorum (Page 23)

You are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting if you owned shares of our common
stock at the close of business on April 10, 2018, which the Board has set as the record date for the special
meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 117,956,110 shares of common stock
outstanding. Each holder of our common stock is entitled to cast one vote per such share. The presence at the
special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of our common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the
special meeting. However, if a new record date is set for an adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will
have to be established. Shares of our common stock represented at the special meeting but not voted, including
shares of our common stock for which proxies have been received but for which stockholders have abstained,
will be treated as present at the special meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum
for the transaction of all business. Broker non-votes (as defined in the section entitled “The Special Meeting — 
Vote Required” beginning on page 24) will not be counted as present for the purpose of determining whether a
quorum is present.

Vote Required (Page 24)

Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
our common stock entitled to vote on the merger proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” approval of the merger proposal.

Approval of the proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation and the adjournment
proposal each require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Broker non-votes will not
have an effect on these proposals; however, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these
proposals.

As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of Microsemi beneficially owned and were entitled
to vote, in the aggregate, 860,090 shares of our common stock (not including any shares of our common stock
deliverable upon exercise or conversion of or underlying any options, unvested Microsemi restricted stock unit
(which we refer to as RSU) awards or Microsemi performance stock unit (which we refer to as PSU) awards),
representing approximately 0.73% of the outstanding voting power of our common stock. The directors have
informed Microsemi that they currently intend to vote all such shares of our common stock “FOR” approval of
the merger proposal, “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation for
the named executive officers and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

Proxies and Revocation (Page 26)

Any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may vote in person by appearing at the
special meeting, or by submitting a proxy over the Internet, by telephone, or by mail using the enclosed postage-
paid envelope. If you are a beneficial owner of our common stock and your shares are held in “street name,” you
should instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee on how to vote your shares of our common stock
using the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee. If you fail to vote in person at the
special meeting, fail to return your proxy card and fail to submit your proxy by telephone or the Internet, or if
your shares are held in “street name” by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you fail to instruct your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote, that will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” approval of
the merger proposal.

You have the right to revoke your proxy. If your shares are registered directly in your name, you may revoke
your proxy or change your vote before the special meeting by voting over the Internet or by telephone, signing a
revocation of proxy and mailing it, signing a new proxy and mailing it, or attending the special meeting and
requesting that your proxy be revoked and/or voting in person. If you hold shares in “street name” through a
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee to determine how
to revoke or change your voting instruction form. See “The Special Meeting — Voting” beginning on page 25.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Merger (Page 29)

The merger agreement provides that Merger Sub will merge with and into Microsemi. Microsemi will be the
surviving corporation following the merger. As a result of the merger, Microsemi will cease to be a publicly
traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Microchip. You will not own any shares of the
capital stock of the surviving corporation.

Merger Consideration (Page 29)

In the merger, each outstanding share of our common stock will automatically be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to $68.78 (which we refer to as the merger consideration), without interest and
less any applicable withholding taxes, other than shares of our common stock owned by (i) (x) Microchip or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Microchip or (y) Microsemi or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Microsemi (which we refer to together as excluded shares); and (ii) stockholders who have not
voted in favor of the merger and properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance
with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (which we refer to as dissenting shares).

Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board (Page 38)

After careful consideration of various factors as described in the section entitled “The Merger — Reasons for
the Merger; Recommendation of the Board” beginning on page 38, the Board has unanimously determined that
the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, and in the best interests
of, Microsemi and Microsemi’s stockholders and approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Board has also unanimously
resolved that the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by the stockholders of Microsemi at a special
meeting of stockholders and recommended that the stockholders of Microsemi vote to adopt the merger
agreement. The Board consulted with Microsemi’s outside financial and legal advisors and senior management
and considered a number of factors that the Board believes support its decision.

In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger proposal, you should be aware
that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
yours. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating
the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the
stockholders of Microsemi. See “The Merger — Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger” beginning on page
55.

The Board recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the merger proposal, “FOR” approval of
the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation arrangements for
Microsemi’s named executive officers in connection with the merger and “FOR” the adjournment
proposal.

Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of March 1, 2018 and based upon and subject to
the various assumptions, considerations, limitations and other matters set forth in the opinion, the $68.78 in cash

pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement. It does not address any other aspect of
the merger. It does not constitute a recommendation to any Microsemi stockholder as to how to vote with respect
to the merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the prices at which the shares of Microsemi
common stock will trade at any time.

Financing of the Merger (Page 51)

Microchip and Merger Sub expect to fund amounts needed to acquire Microsemi under the merger
agreement and repay certain outstanding indebtedness of Microsemi through debt financing under the debt
commitment letter described in the section entitled “The Merger — Financing of the Merger” beginning on page
51, debt incurred under Microchip’s existing revolving line of credit, the issuance of a new term loan B facility,
and Microchip’s and Microsemi’s combined cash and cash equivalents on hand at closing. Microchip has
obtained binding financing commitments in an aggregate principal amount of  $8.747 billion for the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. Microchip and Merger Sub’s obligations under the merger agreement are
not subject to, or conditioned on, the receipt or availability of any funds or financing.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger (Page 55)

In considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to adopt the merger agreement, you should be
aware that Microsemi’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or
in addition to, those of Microsemi stockholders generally. Members of the Board were aware of and considered
these interests, at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the
merger, approving the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending to Microsemi stockholders that
the merger agreement be adopted. For more information, see the sections entitled “The Merger — Background of
the Merger” beginning on page 29 and “The Merger — Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board”
beginning on page 38. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the
narrative of the section entitled “Non-Binding, Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for Microsemi’s
Named Executive Officers — Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 85.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 60)

The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable
transaction to U.S. holders (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger” on page 60) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Stockholders who are U.S.
holders will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of
cash received with respect to their shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger and their adjusted tax basis
in such shares. You should read “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”
beginning on page 60 for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.
You should also consult your tax advisor for a complete analysis of the effect of the merger on your federal, state
and local and/or foreign taxes.

Regulatory Approvals (Page 61)

Microsemi, Microchip and Merger Sub have agreed to cooperate and coordinate with each other and use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents,
approvals, orders and authorizations from governmental entities, the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting periods, making all necessary registrations, declarations and filings, including under relevant antitrust
laws (as described more particularly in the section entitled “The Merger — Regulatory Approvals” beginning on
page 61).

HSR Clearance.   Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (which
we refer to as the HSR Act), and related rules, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed
until notifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (which we refer to as the Antitrust Division), and the United States Federal Trade Commission (which we
refer to as the FTC), and all statutory waiting period requirements have been

• Common Stock.   Each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to
receive $68.78 in cash from Microchip, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes.

• Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.   At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi stock
option and stock appreciation right (or portion thereof) outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger (whether vested or unvested) will be assumed by Microchip and converted into a
Microchip option or stock appreciation right with respect to a number of shares of Microchip common
stock equal to the product of  (i) the number of shares of Microsemi common stock subject to the
Microsemi stock option or stock appreciation right immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger and (ii) the equity award exchange ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share). The
exercise or base price per share of each assumed option or stock appreciation right will equal the
exercise or base price per share of Microsemi common stock under such award immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger divided by the equity award exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent). Each assumed option or stock appreciation right will otherwise be subject to the same
terms and conditions that were applicable to the award immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, including the same vesting schedule and any applicable accelerated vesting provisions. The
“equity award exchange ratio” is the quotient obtained by dividing $68.78 by the average closing price
for a share of Microchip common stock (rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent as reported on
Nasdaq) for the ten most recent days ending on the last trading day immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger.

• Unvested Restricted Stock Unit Awards.   At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi RSU
award that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, to the extent unvested
(after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting in connection with the merger pursuant to the terms of
the award), will be assumed by Microchip and converted into a Microchip RSU, with the number of
shares of Microchip common stock subject to assumed RSUs equal to the product of  (i) the number of
shares of Microsemi common stock subject to the unvested Microsemi RSU award as of immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger and (ii) the equity award exchange ratio (rounded down to the
nearest whole share). Each assumed RSU will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
that were applicable to such award immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, including the
same vesting schedule and any applicable accelerated vesting provisions.

• Vested Restricted Stock Unit Awards.   At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi RSU award
that is outstanding and unsettled immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and

satisfied. The merger agreement requires the parties use reasonable best efforts to make all necessary filings
under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable after the date of the merger agreement. Completion of the merger
is subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.

On March 13, 2018, Microchip and Microsemi filed notification of the proposed merger with the Antitrust
Division and the FTC under the HSR Act. The 30-day waiting period expired at 8:59 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time
on April 12, 2018.

Other Antitrust Law Clearances.   Completion of the merger is further subject to the clearances, consents,
approvals, and waiting periods applicable to the consummation of the merger under certain foreign antitrust laws
having been obtained or expired or been earlier terminated, as applicable. Microchip and Microsemi have
submitted filings in Austria, Germany, China, the Philippines and Taiwan and will submit a filing in Japan as
promptly as is reasonably practicable (as described more particularly in the section entitled “The Merger — 
Other Regulatory Approvals” beginning on page 62).

• Performance-Based Stock Unit Awards.   At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi PSU
award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be vested immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger as to a percentage of the total number of shares of Microsemi
common stock subject to the award as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board
(which percentage will in no event be less than 100% of the target number of shares subject to the
award or greater than the maximum possible vesting percentage under the terms of the award). Each
such vested Microsemi PSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (without interest
and less applicable withholding taxes) an amount in cash equal to the number of vested PSUs (after
giving effect to the foregoing determination by the Compensation Committee) multiplied by $68.78.

• Restricted Stock.   At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi restricted stock award as to
which all or a portion of the shares of Microsemi common stock then subject to the award are
outstanding and unvested (“Restricted Stock”) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to $68.78 (less applicable withholding taxes), which will be subject to the
same vesting requirements and other terms and conditions that were applicable to such Restricted Stock
award immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (including any vesting or acceleration
provisions provided with respect to the award). The cash amount will be paid on or reasonably
promptly after the applicable vesting date.

• Non-US Company Compensatory Awards.   Microsemi and Microchip may, prior to the effective time
of the merger, agree that any outstanding stock option, stock appreciation right, RSU, PSU or
Restricted Stock award that is subject to the laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction be treated in a manner other
than as set forth above, to the extent that Microsemi and Microchip reasonably and in good faith
determine that (A) the manner in which such award would otherwise be treated would result in a
violation of applicable laws or a materially adverse tax consequence to the individual holding such
award in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction, (B) such different treatment is necessary to comply with
such applicable laws and (C) such different treatment is, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent
with the applicable provisions of the merger agreement.

that is vested or will vest in connection with the merger pursuant to the terms of the award will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes)
an amount in cash equal to the number of shares subject to the vested RSU award multiplied by $68.78.

No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation Changes (Page 73)

The merger agreement provides that we will use our reasonable best efforts to cease and cause to be
terminated, and will not authorize or knowingly permit any further activities, discussion or negotiations with any
third party that were ongoing before the date of the merger agreement and relate to any acquisition proposal (as
defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals; Board
Recommendation Changes” beginning on page 73). Additionally, we were required to request that all confidential
information shared under a confidentiality agreement executed within one year of the merger agreement with any
third party in consideration of an acquisition proposal be destroyed or returned.

Under the merger agreement, we are not permitted to (and may not authorize or knowingly permit any of our
representatives to), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce the
making, submission or announcement of any acquisition proposal or the making of any inquiry, offer or proposal
that would reasonably be expected to lead to any acquisition proposal, (ii) furnish to any third party any non-
public information relating to Microsemi or any of its subsidiaries for the known purpose of assisting or
facilitating the making of an acquisition proposal or any inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an acquisition proposal, (iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations regarding an
acquisition proposal with any third party that is seeking to make or has made an acquisition proposal, or (iv)
execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or contract contemplating or otherwise
relating to an acquisition transaction (as defined in the merger agreement).

for up to two 3-month periods under certain circumstances) (which we refer to as the termination
date), as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement —  Termination” beginning on
page 80;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Notwithstanding these restrictions, under certain circumstances, the Board may, prior to the time the merger
agreement is adopted by our stockholders, with respect to any third party that has made (and not withdrawn) a
bona fide written acquisition proposal after the date of the merger agreement and not resulting from a breach of
the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement and that the Board concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes or would be reasonably likely to lead
to a superior proposal, engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with such third party and its
representatives, or furnish to such third party and its representatives any information (including non-public
information) relating to us or any of our subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (the terms of any
such confidentiality agreement are more fully described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — No
Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation Changes” beginning on page 73).

The merger agreement also provides that the Board cannot make a change of recommendation (as defined in
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation
Changes” beginning on page 73); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time before the
stockholders of Microsemi adopt the merger agreement, the Board may make a change of recommendation and
terminate the merger agreement, as described in “The Merger Agreement — Termination” beginning on page 80,
if and only if, (i) in the case of a termination for a superior proposal, the Board determines, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel that the failure to effect a change of recommendation would reasonably be likely to
constitute a breach of the directors’ fiduciary duties under Delaware law, Microsemi complies with the match
right provisions under the merger agreement, as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — No
Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation Changes — Match Rights” beginning on page 75
and Microchip has not made a written counter-offer or proposal that the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, is at least as favorable, from a financial point of
view, to Microsemi stockholders as the superior proposal, or (ii) a fact, event, change, development or set of
circumstances occurs or exists after the date of the merger agreement that materially affects the business,
operations, financial condition or results of operations of Microsemi, which is not related to either an acquisition
proposal or any fluctuation in the market price or trading volume of our common stock in and of itself, that was
neither known to the Board nor reasonably foreseeable to the Board as of or prior to the date of the merger
agreement and Microsemi complies with the match right provisions under the merger agreement, as described in
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation
Changes — Match Rights” beginning on page 75 and the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a change of recommendation would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of the directors’ fiduciary duties under Delaware law.

Conditions to the Merger (Page 78)
The respective obligations of Microsemi, Microchip and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are subject

to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including the adoption of the merger agreement by
our stockholders, receipt of certain regulatory approvals, the absence of any legal prohibitions to the
consummation of the merger, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties and compliance by
the parties with their respective obligations under the merger agreement. See “The Merger Agreement — 
Conditions to the Merger” beginning on page 78.

Termination (Page 80)
Microsemi and Microchip may, by mutual written consent, terminate the merger agreement and abandon the

merger at any time prior to the effective time of the merger.

• within 12 months following the date of such termination, Microsemi or any of its subsidiaries
consummates a transaction contemplated by an acquisition proposal or enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal (in each case, the references to 20% and 80% in
the definition of acquisition proposal being deemed to be references to 50%).

order to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement providing for a superior proposal, in which
case Microsemi must pay Microchip the termination fee concurrently with and as a condition to

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The termination fee would also be payable in the following circumstances:

Remedies (Page 82)

No termination of the merger agreement will relieve any party to the merger agreement of any liability or
damages to the other party resulting from any fraud or a knowing and willful material breach of its obligations set
forth in the merger agreement.

Except in the event of fraud or a knowing and willful material breach, the parties have agreed that if the
merger agreement is terminated and the termination fee becomes due and payable and is paid by us, the
termination fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Microchip and its subsidiaries against us and our
subsidiaries for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in the merger agreement
or the failure of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to be consummated.
In no event will we be required to pay the termination fee on more than one occasion.

Each party is entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the merger agreement and to obtain
an injunction restraining any breach or violation or threatened breach or violation of the provisions of the merger
agreement. There is no necessity to post a bond or other form of security with or as a condition to obtaining such
injunction or injunctions.

Market Price of Common Stock (Page 91)

The closing price of our common stock on Nasdaq on February 28, 2018, the last trading day prior to the
public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, was $64.90 per share. If the merger is completed,
you will be entitled to receive $68.78 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, for each
share of our common stock owned by you (unless you have properly exercised, and not lost, your appraisal rights
with respect to such shares), which represents (i) a premium of approximately 17% to $58.97 per share, the
closing stock price on January 22, 2018, the last full trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential
sale transaction involving Microsemi, (ii) a premium of approximately 22% to $56.33 per share, the six-month
volume-weighted average closing price of our common stock as of March 1, 2018, the last trading day prior to
the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement and (iii) a premium of approximately 7% to
$64.30 per share, the closing price of our common stock on March 1, 2018, the last trading day prior to the public
announcement of the execution of the merger agreement.

On April 18, 2018, the most recent practicable date before this proxy statement was mailed to our
stockholders, the closing price for our common stock on Nasdaq was $63.62 per share. You are encouraged to
obtain current market quotations for our common stock in connection with voting your shares of common stock.

Appraisal Rights (Page 94)

If the merger is completed, Microsemi’s stockholders will be entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law (which we refer to as the DGCL). This means that you are entitled to
have the fair value of your shares of our common stock determined by the Delaware

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Court of Chancery and to receive payment based on that valuation in lieu of the merger consideration if you
follow exactly the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. The ultimate amount you receive in an
appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the amount you would have received under the
merger agreement.

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to Microsemi before the
vote is taken on the merger proposal and you must not vote (either in person or by proxy) in favor of the merger
proposal. If you fail to follow exactly the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, you may lose your
appraisal rights. See “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 94 and the text of the DGCL appraisal rights statute
reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of our common stock
through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you should
consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making
of a demand for appraisal by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee. In view of the complexity of the
DGCL, stockholders who may wish to pursue appraisal rights should consult their legal and financial advisors
promptly.

Delisting and Deregistration of Common Stock (Page 98)

If the merger is completed, our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
successor statute, rules and regulations thereto (which we refer to as the Exchange Act), and we will no longer
file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the SEC), on account of
our common stock.

Q. What is a quorum?
A. The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of our

common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, constitutes a quorum for
the transaction of business at the special meeting. Once a share is represented at the special meeting, it will
be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting. Shares of our common stock
represented at the special meeting but not voted, including shares of our common stock for which proxies
have been received but for which stockholders have abstained, will be treated as present at the special
meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business.
Broker non-votes will not be counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

Q. How do I vote?
A. Stockholder of Record.   If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered directly in your

name, you may have your shares of our common stock voted on matters presented at the special meeting in
any of the following ways:

• In Person.   You may attend the special meeting and cast your vote there. Even if you plan to attend the
meeting, it is desirable that you vote in advance of the meeting.

• By Proxy.   Stockholders of record have a choice of voting by proxy:

• Over the Internet:   Stockholders may submit proxies via the Internet by following the
instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. Your shares will be voted according to your
instructions. You must submit your Internet proxy before 9:00 p.m., Pacific Daylight Time, on
May 21, 2018, the day before the special meeting, for your proxy to be valid and your vote to
count;

• By Telephone:   Call (800) 652-8683, toll-free from the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico,
and follow the recorded instructions. You must specify how you want your shares voted and
confirm your vote at the end of the call or your telephone vote cannot be completed. Your shares
will be voted according to your instructions. You must submit your telephonic proxy before
9:00 p.m., Pacific Daylight Time, on May 21, 2018, the day before the special meeting, for your
proxy to be valid and your vote to count; or

• By Mail:   Complete and sign the enclosed proxy card and mail it in the accompanying pre-
addressed envelope. Your shares will be voted according to your instructions. Your proxy card
must be received by May 21, 2018, the day before the special meeting, for your proxy to be valid
and your vote to count.

Q. What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A. If your shares of our common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent,

Computershare Shareowner Services LLC. (which we refer to as Computershare), you are considered, with
respect to those shares of our common stock, the stockholder of record. This proxy statement

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect to adjourn or postpone the special
meeting until we solicit enough proxies to obtain a quorum.

Beneficial Owner.   If you are a beneficial owner, please refer to the instructions provided by your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee in order to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee
on how to vote your shares. To attend the meeting in person (regardless of whether you intend to vote
your shares in person at the meeting), you must obtain an admission ticket in advance of the meeting by
following the instructions under “The Special Meeting — Attendance” beginning on page 24 of this
proxy statement. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner and wish to vote in person at the special
meeting, you must provide a “legal proxy” from the bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that is the
stockholder of record for your shares of our common stock giving you the right to vote the shares at the
meeting.

Q. How can I change or revoke my vote?

A. You have the right to revoke a proxy. If your shares are registered directly in your name, you may revoke
your proxy or change your vote before the special meeting. To do so, you must do one of the following:

• Vote over the Internet or by telephone as instructed above. Only your latest Internet or telephone vote is
counted. You may not change your vote over the Internet or by telephone after 9:00 p.m., Pacific
Daylight Time, on May 21, 2018.

• Sign a revocation of proxy or a new proxy and mail it in the accompanying pre-addressed envelope.
Only your latest dated, valid proxy received not later than May 21, 2018 will be counted.

• Attend the special meeting and request that your proxy be revoked and/or vote in person as instructed
above. Attending the special meeting will not revoke your Internet vote, telephone vote or proxy, as the
case may be, unless you specifically request it.

Q. What is a proxy?

A. A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of our
common stock. The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special
meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of our
common stock is called a “proxy card.”

Q. If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of common stock voted?

A. If you vote by proxy, regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed
proxy card, and each of them, with full power of substitution, will vote your shares of our common stock in
the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone processes or the proxy card, you may
specify whether your shares of our common stock should be voted “FOR” or “AGAINST” or to
“ABSTAIN” from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the special
meeting.

and proxy card have been sent directly to you by Microsemi. As the stockholder of record, you have the
right to vote in person at the meeting or to grant your voting rights directly to Microsemi or to a third party
by a proxy duly executed or transmitted in a manner in accordance with applicable law.

If your shares of our common stock are held in “street name” through a bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares. In that case, this proxy statement has been
forwarded to you by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those
shares of our common stock, the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for
voting. Your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee should send you, as the beneficial owner, a package
describing the procedure for voting your shares (see also the Q&A entitled “If my shares of common stock
are held in “street name” by my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, will my bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee vote my shares of common stock for me?” below for a discussion on how your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee will vote your shares if you do not provide instructions).

If you hold shares in “street name” through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you should contact
your bank, broker or other nominee to determine how to revoke or change your voting instruction form.

If you are a holder of record and you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how
your shares of our common stock should be voted on a matter, the shares of our common stock represented
by your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” approval of the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve, by non-binding,

Q. Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A. Microsemi has engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. (which we refer to as the proxy solicitor) to assist in the

solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. Microsemi estimates that it will pay the proxy solicitor a fee
of  $15,000. Microsemi has also agreed to reimburse the proxy solicitor for certain reasonable and
documented fees and expenses and will indemnify the proxy solicitor and all of its directors, officers,
employees and agents against certain claims, expenses, losses, damages and/or liabilities. Microsemi may
also reimburse banks, brokers or their agents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial
owners of our common stock. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies by telephone,
by facsimile, by mail, on the Internet or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for
soliciting proxies.

Q. How are votes counted?
A. For the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.”

Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” approval of the proposal
to adopt the merger agreement.

Q. Who will count the votes?
A. The votes will be counted by the inspector of elections appointed for the special meeting.

Q. What do I do if I receive more than one proxy or set of voting instructions?
A. If you received more than one proxy card, your shares are likely registered in different names or with

different addresses or are in more than one account. You must separately vote the shares shown on each
proxy card that you received in order for all of your shares to be voted at the meeting.

Q. If my shares of common stock are held in “street name” by my bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee, will my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee vote my shares of common stock for me?

A. Your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of our common stock
if you instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures
provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee regarding the voting of your shares of our common
stock. Banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” for customers generally
have the authority to vote on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial
owners. However, banks, brokerage firms and other nominees are precluded from exercising their voting
discretion with respect to approving non-routine matters, such as the merger proposal, the proposal to
approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation arrangements for Microsemi’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger, and the adjournment proposal. As a result, absent specific
instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares of our common stock, banks, brokerage firms or other
nominees are not empowered to vote those shares of our common stock on non-routine matters (which we
refer to as broker non-votes). If you do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your
shares of our common stock, your shares of our common stock will not be voted, and as broker non-votes,
the effect will be the same as a vote “AGAINST” approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement,
and your shares of our common stock will not have an effect on either the proposal to approve, by non-
binding, advisory vote, the merger-related executive compensation or the adjournment proposal.

with the merger and “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting
from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a
quorum.

For the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the merger-related executive compensation and
the adjournment proposal you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Broker non-votes will not
have an effect on these proposals.; however, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
such proposals.

Q. Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote,
certain compensation arrangements for Microsemi’s named executive officers in connection with the
merger?

A. Under SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation that
may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger, or “golden parachute” compensation.

Q. What will happen if Microsemi’s stockholders do not approve the proposal to approve, by non-
binding, advisory vote, certain compensation arrangements for Microsemi’s named executive officers
in connection with the merger?

A. The vote on the proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation is a vote separate and apart
from the vote to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, a stockholder may vote to approve the proposal
to approve the merger-related executive compensation and vote not to adopt the merger agreement and vice
versa. Because the vote on the proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation is advisory in
nature only, it will not be binding on Microsemi, Microchip or the surviving corporation in the merger.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved by Microsemi’s stockholders and the merger is completed,
the merger-related compensation may be paid to Microsemi’s named executive officers to the extent payable
in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if the stockholders
do not approve the proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation.

Q. What vote is required for Microsemi’s stockholders to approve the merger proposal?
A. Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of

our common stock entitled to vote on the merger proposal.

Q. What vote of our stockholders is required to approve the proposal to approve, by non-binding,
advisory vote, certain compensation arrangements for Microsemi’s named executive officers in
connection with the merger?

A. The non-binding, advisory vote on the proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. If your shares of our
common stock are present at the special meeting but are not voted to approve the proposal to approve the
merger-related executive compensation, or if you vote to abstain on the proposal, that will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger-related executive compensation proposal. If you fail to attend the
special meeting in person, fail to return your proxy card and fail to submit your proxy by telephone or the
Internet, or if your shares are held in “street name” by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you
fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote, that will not have an effect on the
proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation.

Q. What vote of our stockholders is required to approve the adjournment proposal?
A. Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares

of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the
subject matter. If your shares of our common stock are present at the special meeting but are not voted to
approve the adjournment proposal, or if you vote to abstain on the proposal, that will have the same effect as
a vote “AGAINST” the adjournment proposal. If you fail to attend the special meeting in person, fail to
return your proxy card and fail to submit your proxy by telephone or the Internet, or if your shares are held
in “street name” by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you fail to instruct your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee to vote, that will not have an effect on the adjournment proposal.

Q. What is the proposed merger transaction and what effects will it have on Microsemi?

A. The proposed merger transaction is the acquisition of Microsemi by Microchip pursuant to the merger
agreement. If the merger proposal is approved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under
the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Microsemi, with
Microsemi being the surviving corporation. We refer to this transaction as the merger. As a result of the
merger, Microsemi will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Microchip and will no longer be a publicly
held corporation, and you, as a holder of our common stock, will no longer have any interest in our future
earnings or growth. In addition, following the merger, our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and
deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of
our common stock.

Q. What will I receive if the merger is completed?

A. Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the merger consideration of  $68.78 in cash,
without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of our common stock that you own,
unless you have properly exercised, and not withdrawn or otherwise lost, your appraisal rights under the
DGCL with respect to such shares. For example, if you own 100 shares of our common stock, you will
receive $6,878 in cash in exchange for your shares of our common stock, less any applicable withholding
taxes. You will not own any shares of the capital stock in the surviving corporation. Please do NOT return
any stock certificates you hold with your proxy.

Q. How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of our common stock prior to media
speculation regarding a potential sale transaction?

A. The merger consideration of  $68.78 per share represents (i) a premium of approximately 17% to $58.97 per
share, the closing stock price on January 22, 2018, the last full trading day prior to media speculation
regarding a potential sale transaction involving Microsemi, (ii) a premium of approximately 22% to $56.33
per share, the six-month volume-weighted average closing price of our common stock as of March 1, 2018,
the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement and (iii) a
premium of approximately 7% to $64.30 per share, the closing price of our common stock on March 1,
2018, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement.

Q. What will holders of Microsemi equity-based and performance awards receive in the merger?

A. At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi stock option and stock appreciation right (or portion
thereof) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (whether vested or unvested) will
be assumed by Microchip and converted into a Microchip option or stock appreciation right with respect to a
number of shares of Microchip common stock equal to the product of  (i) the number of shares of Microsemi
common stock subject to the Microsemi stock option or stock appreciation right immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger and (ii) the equity award exchange ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole
share). The exercise or base price per share of each assumed option or stock appreciation right will equal the
exercise or base price per share of Microsemi common stock under such award immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger divided by the equity award exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent). Each assumed option or stock appreciation right will otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions that were applicable to the award immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, including
the same vesting schedule and any applicable accelerated vesting provisions. The “equity award exchange
ratio” is the quotient obtained by dividing $68.78 by the average closing price for a share of Microchip
common stock (rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent as reported on Nasdaq) for the ten most recent
days ending on the last trading day immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi RSU award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, to the extent unvested (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting in
connection with the merger pursuant to the terms of the award), will be assumed by Microchip and
converted into a Microchip RSU, with the number of shares of Microchip common stock subject to assumed
RSUs equal to the product of  (i) the number of shares of Microsemi

Q. When do you expect the merger to be completed?
A. We are working towards completing the merger as soon as possible. Assuming timely receipt of required

regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions, including approval by our stockholders of
the merger proposal, we anticipate that the merger will be completed in June 2018.

Q. When will stockholders receive the merger consideration?
A. Immediately following the effective time of the merger, Microchip will deposit, or will cause to be

deposited, with a payment agent selected by Microchip and reasonably acceptable to Microsemi (which we
refer to as the payment agent), for the benefit of the holders of shares of our common stock, a cash amount
in immediately available funds necessary to pay the aggregate merger consideration payable to our
stockholders and, to the extent not previously deposited by Microsemi with another financial institution, the
consideration payable to our equity-based and performance-based award holders as a result of the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

common stock subject to the unvested Microsemi RSU award as of immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger and (ii) the equity award exchange ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share). Each
assumed RSU will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to such award
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, including the same vesting schedule and any
applicable accelerated vesting provisions.

At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi RSU award that is outstanding and unsettled
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and that is vested or will vest in connection with the
merger pursuant to the terms of the award will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (without
interest and less applicable withholding taxes) an amount in cash equal to the number of shares subject to the
vested RSU award multiplied by $68.78. The cash amount will be paid on or reasonably promptly after the
applicable vesting date.

At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi PSU award outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be vested immediately prior to the effective time of the merger as to
a percentage of the total number of shares of Microsemi common stock subject to the award as determined
by the Compensation Committee of the Board (which percentage will in no event be less than 100% of the
target number of shares subject to the award or greater than the maximum possible vesting percentage under
the terms of the award). Each such vested Microsemi PSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) an amount in cash equal to the number of
vested PSUs (after giving effect to the foregoing determination by the Compensation Committee) multiplied
by $68.78.

At the effective time of the merger, each share of Microsemi Restricted Stock will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $68.78 (less applicable withholding taxes),
which will be subject to the same vesting requirements and other terms and conditions that were applicable
to such Restricted Stock award immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (including any vesting
or acceleration provisions provided with respect to the award).

Microsemi and Microchip may, prior to the effective time of the merger, agree that any outstanding stock
option, stock appreciation right, RSU, PSU or Restricted Stock award that is subject to the laws of a non-
U.S. jurisdiction be treated in a manner other than as set forth above, to the extent that Microsemi and
Microchip reasonably and in good faith determine that (A) the manner in which such award would otherwise
be treated would result in a violation of applicable laws or a materially adverse tax consequence to the
individual holding such award in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction, (B) such different treatment is
necessary to comply with such applicable laws and (C) such different treatment is, to the maximum extent
practicable, consistent with the applicable provisions of the merger agreement.

Promptly after the effective time of the merger, and in any event within five business days thereafter,
Microchip and the surviving corporation will cause the payment agent to mail (i) to each of our stockholders
of record immediately prior to the effective time of the merger who hold certificated shares of our common
stock (other than holders of excluded shares and dissenting shares) (A) a letter of transmittal specifying that
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon the

Q. What happens if the merger is not completed?

A. If the merger proposal is not approved by the stockholders of Microsemi or if the merger is not completed
for any other reason, the stockholders of Microsemi will not receive any payment for their shares of our
common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Microsemi will remain an independent public
company and our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq. Under specified
circumstances, Microsemi may be required to reimburse up to $35,000,000 of Microchip’s expenses or pay a
$290,000,000 termination fee with respect to the termination of the merger agreement, as described under
“The Merger Agreement — Termination Fee” beginning on page 81.

Q. What conditions must be satisfied to complete the merger?

A. Microsemi, Microchip and Merger Sub are not required to complete the merger unless a number of
conditions are satisfied or waived. These conditions include, among others: (i) the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock to adopt the merger agreement will
have been obtained; (ii) all waiting periods (and extensions thereof) applicable to the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement under the HSR Act will have expired or been terminated and all
other applicable antitrust, competition or merger control or regulatory consents (as described more
particularly in the section entitled “The Merger — Regulatory Approvals” beginning on page 61) will have
been received (or been deemed to have been received by virtue of the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period); (iii) no governmental entity of competent jurisdiction will have (a) enacted,
issued, promulgated, entered, enforced or deemed applicable to the merger any material applicable law that
is in effect and has the effect of making the consummation of the merger illegal in any jurisdiction or
(b) issued or granted any order that has the effect of making the consummation of the merger illegal in any
jurisdiction; and (iv) customary conditions in favor of each of the parties regarding the accuracy of the other
party’s representations and warranties (subject to customary materiality qualifiers) and the other party’s
compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in the merger agreement (subject to customary
materiality qualifiers). For a more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived
prior to the completion of the merger, see “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Merger” beginning
on page 78.

Q. Is the merger expected to be taxable to me?

A. Yes. The exchange of shares of our common stock for the merger consideration of  $68.78 per share in cash
pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders (as defined in the section
entitled “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” on page 60) for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are a U.S. holder and you exchange your shares of our common
stock in the merger for cash, you generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference,
if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and your adjusted tax basis in such
shares. We encourage you to read “The Merger — Material U.S.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

delivery of the certificates representing shares of our common stock (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
certificates as provided in the merger agreement) to the payment agent, and (B) instructions advising each
such holder of record how to surrender his, her or its shares of our common stock in exchange for the merger
consideration, and (ii) to each of our stockholders of record immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger who hold uncertificated shares of our common stock (other than holders of excluded shares and
dissenting shares), a notice that the merger has become effective. The payment agent will pay each holder of
record the aggregate merger consideration to which such holder is entitled (i) in the case of certificated
shares, after delivery or transfer of such shares by holders of certificated shares and (ii) in the case of
uncertificated shares, without any action on the part of the person in whose name such uncertificated shares
are registered. Interest will not be paid or accrue in respect of the merger consideration. From the effective
time until the surrender or transfer of certificates or book-entry shares, as the case may be, each such
certificate or book-entry share will represent only the right to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount
(after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) equal to the merger consideration.

Q. Do any of Microsemi’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in
addition to my interests as a stockholder?

A. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger proposal, you should be aware
that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in
addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these
interests, at the time, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the
merger, approving the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending that the merger agreement
be adopted by the stockholders of Microsemi. See “The Merger — Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger” beginning on page 55 and “Non-Binding, Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for
Microsemi’s Named Executive Officers” beginning on page 85.

Q. What happens if I sell my shares of our common stock before the special meeting?

A. The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than both the date of the
special meeting and the consummation of the merger. If you transfer your shares of our common stock after
the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy)
are made between you and the person to whom you transfer your shares, you will retain your right to vote
such shares at the special meeting but will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration to the person
to whom you transfer your shares.

Q. What happens if I sell my shares of common stock after the special meeting but before the effective
time of the merger?

A. If you transfer your shares after the special meeting but before the effective time of the merger, you will
have transferred the right to receive the merger consideration to the person to whom you transfer your
shares. In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of our common stock
through the completion of the merger.

Q. What do I need to do now?

A. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, after carefully reading and considering the information
contained in this proxy statement, please vote promptly to ensure that your shares are represented at the
special meeting. If you hold your shares of our common stock in your own name as the stockholder of
record, you may submit a proxy to have your shares of our common stock voted at the special meeting in
one of three ways: (i) using the Internet in accordance with the instructions set forth on the enclosed proxy
card, (ii) calling toll-free at (800) 652-8683 or (iii) completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed
proxy card in the accompanying postage-paid reply envelope. If you decide to attend the special meeting
and vote in person, your vote by ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted. If you are a beneficial
owner, please refer to the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee in order to
instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee on how to vote your shares.

Q. Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A. No. If the merger proposal is approved and the merger is consummated, if you hold certificated shares of our
common stock, you will be sent a letter of transmittal promptly, and in any event within five business days
of the effective time of the merger, describing how you may exchange your shares of our common stock for
the merger consideration. If you hold uncertificated shares of our common stock, your shares will be
converted in to the merger consideration following the completion of the merger without any further action
by you. If your shares of our common stock are held in “street name” through a bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee, you should contact your bank, brokerage firm or

Q. Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL instead of receiving the merger
consideration for my shares of our common stock?

DGCL in connection with the merger if you take certain actions and meet certain conditions, including that
you do not vote (in person or by proxy) in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. See “Appraisal

proposal);

• to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation arrangements for Microsemi’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger (Proposal 2 on your proxy card) (which we refer to as
the proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation); and

• to approve the adjournment of the special meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SPECIAL MEETING

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting

This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Board
for use at the special meeting to be held at our corporate offices located at One Enterprise, Aliso Viejo, California
92656 on May 22, 2018 at 10:00 a.m., local time, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, holders of our common stock will be asked to consider and vote on the following
proposals:

The Board recommends that you vote “FOR” each of the above proposals.

Our stockholders must approve the merger proposal in order for the merger to occur. If our stockholders fail
to approve the merger proposal, the merger will not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex
A to this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read carefully and in its entirety.

The non-binding, advisory vote on the proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation is a
vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, a stockholder may vote to
approve the proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation and vote not to adopt the merger
agreement and vice versa. Because the vote on the proposal to approve the merger-related executive
compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on Microsemi, Microchip or the surviving
corporation in the merger. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by Microsemi’s stockholders and the
merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to Microsemi’s named executive officers to
the extent payable in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if the
stockholders do not approve the proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation.

Record Date and Quorum

The Board has fixed the close of business on April 10, 2018 as the record date for determination of
stockholders entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting, and any adjournments or
postponements thereof. Only holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on the record date
are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at (in person or by proxy), the special meeting and at any
adjournment or postponement thereof.

As of the close of business on the record date, there were 117,956,110 shares of common stock outstanding.
Each holder of our common stock is entitled to cast one vote per such share on each matter properly brought
before the special meeting for each share of our common stock that such holder owned as of the record date.

The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the
shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting constitutes a
quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting. Once a share is represented at

the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting. Shares of
our common stock represented at the special meeting but not voted, including shares of our common stock for
which proxies have been received but for which stockholders have abstained, will be treated as present at the
special meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all
business. Broker non-votes (as defined below) will not be counted for the purpose of determining the presence of
a quorum. Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares of our common stock you own.
Because stockholders cannot take any action at the meeting (other than to adjourn the meeting) unless a
majority of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat is represented, it is
important that you attend the meeting in person or are represented by proxy at the meeting.

In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect to adjourn or postpone the special
meeting until we solicit enough proxies to obtain a quorum.

Attendance

Only stockholders of record, their duly appointed proxy holders and our guests may attend the special
meeting. To gain admittance, please bring the admission ticket with you to the meeting. If your shares of our
common stock are held in “street name” through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, please send a written
request for an admission ticket to our Secretary at One Enterprise, Aliso Viejo, California 92656, Attn: Secretary.
Please include the following information with your request: (i) a signed cover letter stating your name and
complete mailing address, including daytime and evening telephone numbers; that you are requesting an
admission ticket; the number of shares that you own in “street name”; and the name, address and telephone
number of your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that is the stockholder of record for your shares of our
common stock and (ii) an original signed “legal proxy” from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee giving
you the right to vote the shares at the special meeting. If you are the representative of a corporate or institutional
stockholder, you must present valid photo identification along with proof that you are the representative of such
stockholder. Please note that cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the
special meeting.

Vote Required

Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
our common stock entitled to vote on the merger proposal. For the merger proposal, you may vote “FOR,”
“AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will not be counted as votes cast in favor of the merger proposal, but
will count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. Your vote is very important, regardless
of the number of shares of our common stock you own. Because stockholders cannot take any action at the
meeting (other than to adjourn the meeting) unless a majority of our common stock issued and outstanding
entitled to vote thereat is represented, it is important that you attend the meeting in person or are
represented by proxy at the meeting. If you fail to vote in person at the special meeting, fail to return your
proxy card and fail to submit your proxy by telephone or the Internet, or if your shares are held in “street
name” by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm
or other nominee to vote, that will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” approval of the merger
proposal.

If your shares of our common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent,
Computershare, you are considered, with respect to those shares of our common stock, the stockholder of record.
This proxy statement and proxy card have been sent directly to you by Microsemi. As the stockholder of record,
you have the right to vote in person at the meeting or to grant your voting rights directly to Microsemi or to a
third party by a proxy duly executed or transmitted in a manner in accordance with applicable law.

If your shares of our common stock are held in “street name” through a bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares. In that case, this proxy statement has been
forwarded to you by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares
of our common stock, the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. Your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee should send you, as the beneficial owner, a package describing the procedure for
voting your shares.

• In Person.   You may attend the special meeting and cast your vote there. Even if you plan to attend the
meeting, it is desirable that you vote in advance of the meeting.

• By Proxy.   Stockholders of record have a choice of voting by proxy:
• Over the Internet:   Stockholders may submit proxies via the Internet by following the

instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. Your shares will be voted according to your

count.

• By Telephone:   Call (800) 652-8683, toll-free from the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico,

confirm your vote at the end of the call or your telephone vote cannot be completed. Your shares
will be voted according to your instructions. You must submit your telephonic proxy before
9:00 p.m., Pacific Daylight Time, on May 21, 2018, the day before the special meeting, for your
proxy to be valid and your vote to count; or

addressed envelope. Your shares will be voted according to your instructions. Your proxy card
must be received by May 21, 2018, the day before the special meeting, for your proxy to be valid
and your vote to count.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in “street name” for customers generally have
the authority to vote on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners.
However, banks, brokerage firms and other nominees are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with
respect to approving non-routine matters, such as the merger proposal, the proposal to approve, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, certain compensation arrangements for Microsemi’s named executive officers in connection with
the merger and the adjournment proposal. As a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of
such shares of our common stock, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are not empowered to vote those
shares of our common stock on non-routine matters (which we refer to as broker non-votes).

For the purposes of the merger proposal, if you attend the special meeting and abstain on this
proposal, or if you have given a proxy and have abstained on this proposal, this will have the same effect as
if you voted “AGAINST” approval of the merger proposal. If you do not instruct your bank, brokerage
firm or other nominee to vote your shares of our common stock, your shares of our common stock will not
be voted, and as broker non-votes, the effect will be the same as a vote “AGAINST” approval of the
merger proposal.

Approval of each of the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation
arrangements for Microsemi’s named executive officers in connection with the merger and the adjournment
proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or represented by
proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. For each proposal, you may vote “FOR,”
“AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.” For purposes of each of these proposals, if you attend the special meeting and
abstain on such proposal, or if you have given a proxy and abstained on such proposal, that will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” such proposal. If you fail to attend the special meeting in person, fail to return your
proxy card and fail to submit your proxy by telephone or the Internet, or if your shares are held in “street name”
by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee to vote, that will not have an effect on the proposal to approve by non-binding, advisory vote the
merger-related executive compensation to the named executive officers or the adjournment proposal.

Voting

If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered directly in your name, you may have your
shares of our common stock voted on matters presented at the special meeting in any of the following ways:

If you are a beneficial owner of our common stock and your shares are held in “street name,” you should
receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that you must follow in order to have your
shares of our common stock voted. Those instructions will identify the specific Internet,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

telephone and/or mail voting options that are available to you in order to have your shares voted. Please note that
if you are a beneficial owner and wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you must provide a “legal proxy”
from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that is the stockholder of record for your shares of our common
stock giving you the right to vote the shares at the special meeting. Such a legal proxy is not the form of proxy
enclosed with this proxy statement. You will not be able to vote shares you hold in “street name” through a
bank, broker or other nominee in person at the special meeting unless you have a legal proxy from that
bank, broker or other nominee issued in your name giving you the right to vote your shares.

If you vote by proxy, regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed
proxy card, and each of them, with full power of substitution, will vote your shares of our common stock in the
way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone processes or the proxy card, you may specify
whether your shares of our common stock should be voted “FOR” or “AGAINST” or to “ABSTAIN” from
voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting.

If you are a holder of record and you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how
your shares of our common stock should be voted on a matter, the shares of our common stock represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted “FOR” approval of the merger proposal, “FOR” approval of the
proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation arrangements for Microsemi’s named
executive officers in connection with the merger and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. YOUR VOTE IS
VERY IMPORTANT, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK
YOU OWN. BECAUSE STOCKHOLDERS CANNOT TAKE ANY ACTION AT THE MEETING
(OTHER THAN TO ADJOURN THE MEETING) UNLESS A MAJORITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK
ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING AND ENTITLED TO VOTE THEREAT IS REPRESENTED, IT IS
IMPORTANT THAT YOU ATTEND THE MEETING IN PERSON OR ARE REPRESENTED BY
PROXY AT THE MEETING. WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL
MEETING, PLEASE COMPLETE, DATE, SIGN AND RETURN, AS PROMPTLY AS POSSIBLE, THE
ENCLOSED PROXY CARD IN THE ACCOMPANYING POSTAGE PAID REPLY ENVELOPE, OR
SUBMIT YOUR PROXY BY TELEPHONE OR THE INTERNET. IF YOU ATTEND THE SPECIAL
MEETING AND VOTE IN PERSON, YOUR VOTE BY BALLOT WILL REVOKE ANY PROXY
PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED.

Voting by Microsemi’s Directors and Executive Officers

As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of Microsemi beneficially owned and were entitled
to vote, in the aggregate, 860,090 shares of our common stock (not including any shares of our common stock
deliverable upon exercise or conversion of or underlying any options, unvested Microsemi RSU awards or
Microsemi PSU awards), representing approximately 0.73% of the outstanding voting power of our common
stock. The directors have informed Microsemi that they currently intend to vote all such shares of our common
stock “FOR” approval of the merger proposal, “FOR” approval of the proposal to approve, by non-binding,
advisory vote, certain compensation arrangements for Microsemi’s named executive officers in connection with
the merger and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

Proxies and Revocation

Any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may submit a proxy by telephone, over the
Internet or by returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying postage-paid reply envelope, or may vote in
person by appearing at the special meeting. If your shares of our common stock are held in “street name” through
a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee on how
to vote your shares of our common stock using the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee. If you are a beneficial owner and wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you must provide a
“legal proxy” from the bank, brokerage firm or other nominee that is the stockholder of record for your shares of
our common stock giving you the right to vote the shares at the special meeting. If you fail to vote in person at
the special meeting, fail to return your proxy card and fail to submit your proxy by telephone or the
Internet, or if your shares are held in “street name” by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and
you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote,

counted. You may not change your vote over the Internet or by telephone after 9:00 p.m., Pacific
Daylight Time, on May 21, 2018.

envelope. Only your latest dated, valid proxy received not later than May 21, 2018 will be counted.

above. Attending the special meeting will not revoke your Internet vote, telephone vote or proxy, as the
case may be, unless you specifically request it.

that will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” approval of the merger proposal. If you fail to attend
the special meeting in person, fail to return your proxy card and fail to submit your proxy by telephone or the
Internet, that will not have an effect on the proposal to approve by non-binding, advisory vote the merger-related
executive compensation to the named executive officers or the adjournment proposal.

You have the right to revoke a proxy. If your shares are registered directly in your name, you may revoke
your proxy or change your vote before the special meeting. To do so, you must do one of the following:

If you hold shares in “street name” through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you should contact
your bank, broker or other nominee to determine how to revoke or change your voting instruction form.

Anticipated Date of Completion of the Merger

We are working towards completing the merger as soon as possible. Assuming timely receipt of required
regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions, including the approval by our stockholders of
the merger proposal, we anticipate that the merger will be completed in June 2018. If our stockholders vote to
approve the merger proposal, the merger will become effective as promptly as practicable following the
satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions to the merger, subject to the terms of the merger agreement. See
“The Merger Agreement — Closing and Effective Time of the Merger” beginning on page 64.

Rights of Stockholders Who Seek Appraisal

If the merger is completed, Microsemi’s stockholders will be entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL in connection with the merger. This means that you are entitled to have the fair value of your shares of
our common stock determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment based on that
valuation in lieu of the merger consideration if you follow exactly the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL. The ultimate amount you receive in an appraisal proceeding may be less than, equal to or more than the
amount you would have received under the merger agreement.

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for appraisal to Microsemi before the
vote is taken on the merger proposal and you must not vote (either in person or by proxy) in favor of the merger
proposal. If you fail to follow exactly the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, you may lose your
appraisal rights. See “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 94 and the text of the DGCL appraisal rights statute
reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of our common stock
through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you should
consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making
of a demand for appraisal by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee. In view of the complexity of the
DGCL, stockholders who may wish to pursue appraisal rights should consult their legal and financial advisors
promptly.

Adjournments and Postponements

Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed. We are submitting
a proposal for your consideration to approve the adjournment of the special meeting from time to time, if
necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof to approve the merger

proposal or in the absence of a quorum (Proposal 3 on your proxy card). Notwithstanding the adjournment
proposal, Microsemi retains full authority to the extent set forth in our by-laws and/or permitted under Delaware
law to adjourn the special meeting for any purpose, or to postpone the special meeting before it is convened,
without the consent of any stockholder of Microsemi, provided that the merger agreement includes certain
limitations on Microsemi’s ability to postpone or adjourn the meeting, as described in the section entitled “Vote
on Adjournment” beginning on page 90.

If the special meeting is adjourned, we are not required to give notice of the time and place of the
reconvened adjourned meeting if such time and place are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken, unless the adjournment is for more than 30 days or, after the adjournment, the Board fixes a new record
date for the special meeting. At any reconvened adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might
have been transacted at the original convening of the special meeting. All proxies will be voted in the same
manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the special meeting, except for any proxies
that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at the reconvened meeting.

Solicitation of Proxies; Payment of Solicitation Expenses

Microsemi has engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. (which we refer to as the proxy solicitor), to assist in the
solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. Microsemi estimates that it will pay the proxy solicitor a fee of 
$15,000. Microsemi has also agreed to reimburse the proxy solicitor for certain reasonable and documented fees
and expenses and will indemnify the proxy solicitor and all of its directors, officers, employees and agents against
certain claims, expenses, losses, damages and/or liabilities. Microsemi may also reimburse banks and brokers or
their agents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of our common stock.
Microsemi’s directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the
Internet or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER

This discussion of the merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. You should read the entire merger agreement carefully and in its
entirety as it is the legal document that governs the merger.

The merger agreement provides that Merger Sub will merge with and into Microsemi. Microsemi will be the
surviving corporation following the merger. As a result of the merger, Microsemi will cease to be a publicly
traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Microchip. You will not own any shares of the
capital stock of the surviving corporation.

Merger Consideration

In the merger, each outstanding share of our common stock will automatically be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to $68.78 (which we refer to as the merger consideration), without interest and
less any applicable withholding taxes, other than shares of our common stock owned by (i)(x) Microchip or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Microchip or (y) Microsemi or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Microsemi (which we refer to together as excluded shares); and (ii) stockholders who have not
voted in favor of the merger and properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to as dissenting shares), which shares will be canceled without
payment of any consideration therefor and will cease to exist.

Background of the Merger

The Board and senior management of Microsemi (which we refer to as management) have regularly
reviewed Microsemi’s performance, future growth prospects, business strategies, opportunities and challenges as
part of their evaluation of Microsemi’s prospects and strategies for enhancing stockholder value. As part of this
process, the Board and management have regularly reviewed Microsemi’s strategic direction and business
objectives, including strategic opportunities that might be available to Microsemi, such as possible acquisitions,
divestitures and business combination transactions.

From time to time, James J. Peterson, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and a senior
executive of Party A, a company in the same industry as Microsemi, discussed generally Microsemi’s and Party
A’s industry and respective businesses, as well as potential partnering opportunities. In early September 2016,
Microsemi received a preliminary non-binding proposal from Party A to purchase all of Microsemi’s outstanding
common stock at a price of  $55.00 per share in cash. The Board reviewed the proposal over the course of
multiple meetings and determined that this price was too low. Representatives of O’Melveny and Myers LLP
(which we refer to as O’Melveny) attended these meetings, and some of these meetings were also attended by
representatives of Qatalyst Partners LP (which we refer to as Qatalyst Partners). At the Board’s direction,
Mr. Peterson reached out to Party A to request that Party A increase the price offered. The Board also decided to
explore strategic alternatives for Microsemi, and Microsemi entered into an engagement letter with Qatalyst
Partners as its exclusive financial advisor, with the approval of the Board. In engaging Qatalyst Partners, the
Board determined that Qatalyst Partners had the requisite knowledge and experience within the semiconductor
sector to advise Microsemi in connection with exploration of strategic alternatives and a successful track record
with respect to the transactions on which they had been engaged.

From mid-September through November 2016, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted eight strategic
parties to inquire whether they might be interested in a business combination transaction with Microsemi.
Ultimately, none of these parties chose to enter into discussions with Microsemi. During this time, Microsemi
continued discussions and shared information with Party A pursuant to a confidentiality agreement. The
confidentiality agreement contained a standstill provision that automatically terminated upon the announcement
of a merger involving Microsemi. On November 2, 2016, several media reports suggested that Microsemi was
running a sale process. Ultimately Party A never submitted a revised proposal. By early December 2016 it
became apparent to Microsemi that Party A was no longer interested in a business combination transaction with
Microsemi. On May 8, 2017, Microsemi terminated its engagement letter with Qatalyst Partners.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On July 27, 2017, a representative from J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (which we refer to as J.P. Morgan), a
financial advisor to Microchip, contacted a member of the Board and indicated that Microchip might be
interested in exploring a business combination transaction with Microsemi. The member of the Board reported
the J.P. Morgan contact to Mr. Peterson, the lead independent director of Microsemi and general counsel of
Microsemi, who collectively asked the director to tell J.P. Morgan to suggest that Microchip contact Mr. Peterson
directly. Steve Sanghi, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the board of directors of Microchip, then
reached out to Mr. Peterson, and on September 21, 2017, Mr. Peterson and Steven Litchfield, Executive Vice
President and Chief Strategy Officer of Microsemi, met Mr. Sanghi for dinner. At this meeting, Mr. Sanghi
expressed Microchip’s interest in a business combination transaction with Microsemi. From late September to
November 2017, various communications took place between Mr. Peterson and Mr. Sanghi through which
Mr. Sanghi reiterated his interest in a possible business combination transaction between Microsemi and
Microchip.

On November 9, 2017, Mr. Sanghi sent a letter to Mr. Peterson and the Board containing a preliminary non-
binding proposal from Microchip to purchase all of Microsemi’s outstanding common stock at a price of  $63.00
per share, “approximately” 35% to 40% of which would be paid in Microchip common stock and the remainder
of which would be paid in cash. No exchange ratio was specified.

On November 13, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the Microchip proposal and whether
Microsemi should explore strategic alternatives. Members of Microsemi management and representatives of
O’Melveny and Qatalyst Partners also attended the meeting. Mr. Peterson described for the Board his discussions
with Mr. Sanghi that preceded Microchip’s proposal. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then discussed with the
Board Microsemi’s potential consideration of strategic alternatives, reviewing with the Board other potential
strategic partners and various financial aspects of a potential business combination transaction involving
Microsemi (including one with Microchip). Representatives of Qatalyst Partners also discussed with the Board
the current state of the semiconductor industry, including the current mergers and acquisitions landscape and the
challenges presently facing Microsemi, as well as the opportunities available to Microsemi. Representatives of
Qatalyst Partners also reviewed Microsemi’s stock price performance over time as compared to its peers and
other benchmarks. Following these discussions, the Board determined to initiate a review of strategic alternatives,
including a potential business combination transaction. Representatives from O’Melveny then reviewed with the
Board a presentation on the Board’s fiduciary duties, including with respect to the consideration of a possible
business combination transaction. After a discussion, the Board decided to re-engage Qatalyst Partners under the
terms of its 2016 engagement letter and to have Qatalyst Partners approach other potential strategic partners on
behalf of Microsemi.

During the remainder of November 2017, representatives of Qatalyst Partners approached ten potential
strategic partners, including Party A, regarding their interest in a potential business combination transaction with
Microsemi. They did not approach Microchip at this time because Microchip had already submitted a proposal.
From mid-November to early December 2017, three of these potential partners, which we refer to as Party B,
Party C and Party D, expressed interest in meeting with management and entered into confidentiality agreements
with Microsemi, as did Microchip. Each of these confidentiality agreements contained standstill provisions that
automatically terminated upon the execution of a merger involving Microsemi. Party A indicated that it was not
interested in a meeting with Microsemi’s management.

On November 21, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the recent communications with
Microchip and other potential partners. Members of management and representatives of O’Melveny also attended
the meeting. Mr. Peterson updated the Board on communications with Microchip and the other potential strategic
partners contacted by representatives of Qatalyst Partners. Mr. Peterson indicated that of the ten potential
strategic partners that had been contacted by representatives of Qatalyst Partners, plus Microchip, three had
declined a meeting, three were interested in a meeting, and five were still in the process of determining their level
of interest. Members of management also provided an update on the management presentation to be given to
potential bidders.

On November 29, 2017, Messrs. Peterson and Litchfield had dinner with the Chief Financial Officer of Party
B and discussed a potential business combination transaction between Microsemi and Party B, including the
parties’ respective businesses and potential deal structure and regulatory issues. Also on

TABLE OF CONTENTS

November 29, 2017, members of management approached an additional potential strategic partner regarding a
potential business combination transaction with Microsemi. That potential strategic partner indicated that it
would likely choose not to enter into discussions with Microsemi.

On November 30, 2017, Messrs. Peterson and Litchfield had lunch with Mr. Sanghi and Ganesh Moorthy,
President and Chief Operating Officer of Microchip, to continue discussions regarding a potential strategic
transaction between Microsemi and Microchip as well as Microsemi’s and Microchip’s respective businesses.

During the week of December 4, 2017, each of Microchip, Party B, Party C and Party D and their respective
financial advisors attended presentations given by management regarding Microsemi’s business, including certain
projections and estimates of future financial and operating performance with respect to Microsemi’s second, third
and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2018, fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020 (which we refer to as the December
2017 management projections). Representatives of Qatalyst also attended those meetings.

On December 7, 2017, the Board held its regularly scheduled meeting, which included an update on the
strategic review process. Members of management and representatives of O’Melveny also attended the meeting.
Mr. Peterson and other members of management discussed with the Board the developments since the last Board
meeting on November 21, 2017, including recent communications with Microchip, Party B, Party C and Party D.
Management also reviewed with the Board the parties that had declined to engage in discussions. Management
discussed with the Board the recent management presentations and the feedback received from Microchip, Party
B and Party C and the upcoming management presentation to Party D, which took place on December 8, 2017.

On December 8, 2017, at the direction of Microsemi management, representatives of Qatalyst Partners sent
process letters to Party B, Party C and Party D indicating that they would be expected to submit non-binding
indications of interest by December 15, 2017. Microchip had already submitted its written proposal of
November 9, 2017, and was not asked to submit a new proposal at this time.

On December 11, 2017, Messrs. Peterson and Litchfield met with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer of Party C to discuss further a potential business combination transaction. Later that day,
representatives of J.P. Morgan, Microchip’s financial advisor, sent Qatalyst Partners a list of follow-up diligence
questions relating to Microsemi’s business.

On December 12, 2017, representatives of J.P. Morgan communicated to representatives of Qatalyst Partners
that Microchip needed more time to analyze the potential impact of the new U.S. tax legislation, and thus would
not be ready to proceed with a potential transaction until sometime in early January 2018. Subsequently on
December 15, 2017, representatives of J.P. Morgan sent Qatalyst Partners a list of tax diligence questions,
including questions relating to the impact of the proposed U.S. tax legislation on Microsemi.

From December 12, 2017 through early January 2018, Microsemi and representatives of Qatalyst Partners
shared information with Microchip and J.P. Morgan, and provided various materials in response to Microchip’s
follow-up diligence questions.

On December 13, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of management and representatives
of O’Melveny and Qatalyst Partners also attended the meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed
with the Board the developments in the strategic review process since the previous Board meeting, including the
management presentations attended by Microchip, Party B, Party C and Party D, feedback from the management
meetings received by Qatalyst Partners to date, and the process letters distributed to the interested parties.
Representatives of Qatalyst Partners also discussed with the Board the parties that had declined to meet with
management and their reasons for not engaging in the process.

Also during the December 13, 2017 Board meeting, members of management reviewed with the Board
Microsemi’s updated 2018 financial projections, including the December 2017 management projections.
Management explained that the projections had been updated since the Board’s last review in September 2017 to
reflect both an upward trend in revenues from Microsemi’s business and the effects of Microsemi’s acquisition of
the Vectron business from Knowles Corporation, which closed in

November 2017. After certain members of management left the meeting, Matthew E. Massengill, director and
then chairman of the compensation committee of the Board (which we refer to as the Compensation Committee),
noted that he had been approached by certain members of management prior to the Board meeting with a request
that the Board consider the compensation arrangements in place for certain members of management (not
including Mr. Peterson) in connection with a potential business combination to promote retention in light of the
risks and uncertainties that a business combination could present to the employment of key personnel. Following
discussion, including in executive session, the Board unanimously approved Microsemi’s updated 2018 financial
projections and determined that it was appropriate to consider further the potential retention concerns expressed
by certain members of management.

On December 15, 2017, Microsemi received preliminary non-binding proposals from Party B and Party C.
Party B proposed to purchase all of Microsemi’s outstanding common stock at a price which, after subsequent
clarification regarding one of the assumptions underlying its proposal, Party B indicated to be $64.65 per share in
cash. Party C proposed to purchase all of Microsemi’s outstanding common stock at a price of  $61.00 per share,
$35.00 of which would be paid in cash and the remainder of which would be paid in Party C common stock,
using a fixed exchange ratio based on the average closing prices of Party C common stock over the five trading
days prior to the signing of a definitive agreement. Also on December 15, 2017, Party D informed representatives
of Qatalyst Partners that after careful deliberation, it had decided that it would not be continuing in the process.

On December 19, 2017, the Board held a meeting to discuss the proposals received to date from Microchip,
Party B and Party C. Members of management and representatives of O’Melveny and Qatalyst Partners also
attended the meeting and participated in these discussions. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed with
the Board preliminary financial aspects of each of the three proposals, including each party’s ability to pay the
proposed consideration. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners and O’Melveny also discussed certain factors the
Board could consider when evaluating the various proposals, including the benefits and risks associated with cash
and stock consideration, potential synergies, market uncertainties, and execution risk, as well as issues of deal
certainty, including regulatory risk.

Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then discussed possible responses to each of Microchip, Party B and
Party C, as well as an illustrative timeline for further management meetings, due diligence and negotiation of a
definitive agreement should the Board decide to proceed. Management and representatives from Qatalyst Partners
and O’Melveny then discussed with the Board potential issues associated with Party B and Party C, including
certain regulatory risks presented by a transaction involving Party B and certain financial risks associated with
Party C. Members of management also discussed with the Board other strategic alternatives available to
Microsemi, including remaining independent and continuing to acquire other companies. After discussion, the
Board determined that it was in the best interest of Microsemi and its stockholders to continue to explore the
possibility of a business combination transaction but to seek higher values. The Board directed management and
representatives of Qatalyst Partners to set up follow-up meetings with each of Microchip, Party B and Party C
and to indicate to each of these parties that they would need to raise the value of the consideration offered. The
Board also discussed the potential retention concerns that certain members of management had mentioned to
Mr. Massengill prior to the December 13, 2017 Board meeting. After a discussion in executive session, the Board
determined that the Compensation Committee should further consider the potential retention concerns.

On December 20, 2017, representatives from Qatalyst Partners conveyed to representatives of J.P. Morgan
that there were other parties interested in buying Microsemi. Qatalyst Partners also informed both Party B and
representatives of the financial advisor of Party C there were other parties interested in buying Microsemi and
that Microsemi would not accept their respective non-binding proposals, but Microsemi would proceed with
additional diligence meetings in January 2018 for the purpose of providing Party B and Party C additional
information to help them increase their offers. Qatalyst Partners subsequently communicated with Party B and
Party C to discuss proposed diligence meetings.

On December 26, 2017, Party B sent an initial due diligence request list to representatives of Qatalyst
Partners.

On December 27, 2017, Mr. Sanghi contacted Mr. Peterson and represented that Microchip was still
interested in pursuing a transaction with Microsemi, but that Microchip needed more time to analyze the impact
of the newly enacted U.S. tax legislation and thus would not be ready to proceed with a potential

transaction until sometime in January 2018. Also on December 27, 2017, a member of Microsemi’s management
had a telephone conversation with management of Party C to discuss the agenda and attendees for a follow-up
management presentation. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners also participated in this conversation.

On January 7, 2018, Microsemi provided Party B with access to its virtual data room in response to its
diligence request list. From January 7, 2018 through January 22, 2018, members of management and
representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided Party B and Party C and their respective financial advisors with
updated presentations regarding Microsemi’s business and additional due diligence materials and discussions.
Also during this time, Microsemi and representatives of O’Melveny undertook additional analysis and
investigation to assess the regulatory risk associated with a transaction with Party B, including a conversation
between O’Melveny and Party B’s legal counsel. Separately during this time, Microsemi and representatives of
Qatalyst Partners provided Microchip and representatives of J.P. Morgan various materials in response to
Microchip’s additional follow-up questions regarding Microsemi’s business, including the anticipated effect of
the new U.S. tax legislation. On January 11, 2018, management and Microchip held a conference call, which was
also attended by representatives of Qatalyst Partners and J.P. Morgan, to provide Microchip with additional due
diligence information regarding various tax matters.

On January 15, 2018, the Board held a telephonic meeting to review the status of discussions with
Microchip, Party B and Party C. A representative of O’Melveny reviewed with the Board information provided
by Qatalyst Partners, which had been distributed to the Board on December 20, 2017, regarding Qatalyst
Partners’ work performed and fees received, if any, from Microchip, Party B or Party C. The Board determined
that Qatalyst Partners had no material relationships with Microchip, Party B and Party C that, in the Board’s
view, would reasonably be expected to impair its ability to perform its financial advisory services to the Board.

On January 22, 2018, Party C indicated that it would not be continuing in the process because the price was
too high. On that same day, after a management meeting with Microsemi, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
representatives of Party B’s financial advisors, Party B indicated to Microsemi and representatives of Qatalyst
Partners that it might not be able to continue in the process.

On January 23, 2018, various media outlets reported that Microsemi was exploring its strategic options,
including a possible sale, after having received a takeover proposal.

On January 24, 2018, Microchip submitted a non-binding proposal to purchase all of Microsemi’s
outstanding common stock at a price of  $65.00 per share, “approximately” 30-35% of which would be paid in
Microchip common stock and the remainder of which would be paid in cash. No exchange ratio was specified.
The proposal was conditioned on Microsemi’s willingness to grant Microchip a 40-day exclusivity period.

Later that same day, the Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the new Microchip proposal as well as
the status of discussions with other parties. Members of management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and
O’Melveny also attended the meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners updated the Board on recent
developments with respect to Microchip, Party B and Party C. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reported that
Microchip had submitted a non-binding proposal just prior to the Board meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners also confirmed to the Board that Party C, and likely Party B, would not be continuing in the process and
their reasons for not doing so. Mr. Peterson relayed his belief to the Board that, based on his discussions with
Mr. Sanghi, Microchip would raise its offer to $67.50 per share to be paid all in cash. Mr. Peterson also indicated
to the Board that he believed that, based on his experience, Microchip might be willing to increase its offer to
$68.57 per share to be paid half in cash and half in Microchip common stock. After a discussion with
management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and O’Melveny, the Board directed Mr. Peterson to go back
to Mr. Sanghi to encourage him to raise Microchip’s bid to $70.00 per share in cash.

Later that day, Mr. Peterson contacted Mr. Sanghi and requested that Microchip raise its price to $70.00 per
share in cash.

On January 25, 2018, in a conversation with Mr. Peterson, Mr. Sanghi indicated that Microchip might be
willing to raise its offer to $67.50 per share to be paid all in cash, conditioned on Microsemi’s willingness to
grant Microchip a 40-day exclusivity period. Mr. Peterson indicated that management and the Board

were targeting $70.00 per share and urged Mr. Sanghi to increase Microchip’s offer. Mr. Sanghi said that
Microchip would consider Mr. Peterson’s request and revert to him within 48 hours. Later that day, Microchip
withdrew the non-binding cash/stock proposal that it had submitted to Microsemi the previous day but indicated
that it would be willing to discuss acquiring Microsemi for all cash consideration. Also on January 25, 2018,
Party B confirmed that it would not be continuing in the process.

On January 26, 2018, representatives from Qatalyst Partners contacted representatives from J.P. Morgan and
urged them to encourage Microchip to raise the price of their proposal to $70.00 per share.

On January 29, 2018, Microchip made a non-binding proposal to purchase all of Microsemi’s outstanding
common stock at a price of  $67.50 per share in cash, conditioned on Microsemi agreeing to a 30-day exclusivity
period.

On January 30, 2018, the Compensation Committee held a meeting with representatives of O’Melveny and
the Compensation Committee’s compensation consultant present to discuss the possibility of an additional
Microsemi equity award for certain members of management (other than Mr. Peterson) that, because of the
vesting requirements that would be applicable to the awards, would provide an additional retention incentive for
management (which we refer to as the New RSU Awards) and possible retention arrangements for certain other
key Microsemi employees.

Also on January 30, 2018, the Board held a meeting to consider the revised Microchip proposal. Members of
management and representatives of O’Melveny and Qatalyst Partners also attended the meeting. Members of
management reviewed Microsemi’s updated 2018 financial projections through fiscal year 2023 (which we refer
to as the January 2018 management projections). The January 2018 management projections included changes
resulting from recent changes in U.S. tax laws, Microsemi’s actual financial results from the first quarter of
Microsemi’s 2018 fiscal year and the guidance that Microsemi had announced during its first quarter earnings call
for the second quarter of Microsemi’s 2018 fiscal year. After discussion, the Board unanimously approved
Microsemi’s January 2018 management projections. The Board also directed management to provide a subset of
the January 2018 management projections to Microchip.

Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then updated the Board on developments since the previous Board
meeting, including Microchip’s most recent bid, Party B’s confirmation that it would not be continuing in the
process and two other inbound inquiries that Qatalyst Partners had recently received with respect to Microsemi.
One new inquiry, received by a representative of Qatalyst Partners on January 26, 2018, was from a strategic
party (which we refer to as Party E) that was interested in buying only a portion of Microsemi’s business. The
other new inquiry, received by a representative of Qatalyst Partners on January 25, 2018, was from a private
equity party that had expressed interest but had not followed up with a proposal as representatives of Qatalyst
Partners had requested. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed with the Board their view that the private
equity party’s interest might not be credible, both due to the lack of any follow-up despite Qatalyst Partners’
request, and because the price of the transaction would require a very large equity commitment from any private
equity buyer, which would make it difficult to achieve the returns on equity expected by private equity buyers
generally. The Board expressed its view that the partial sale transaction referred to by Party E would not be in the
best interests of Microsemi or its stockholders. A representative of O’Melveny reviewed updated information
provided by Qatalyst Partners regarding Qatalyst Partners’ work performed and fees received, if any, from
Microchip, Party E and the private equity party. The Board determined that Qatalyst Partners had no material
relationships with Microchip, Party E or the private equity party that, in the Board’s view, would reasonably be
expected to impair its ability to perform its financial advisory services to the Board.

Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then discussed with the Board preliminary financial aspects of
Microchip’s proposal. After discussing the potential opportunities and risks of pursuing a transaction with
Microchip or remaining an independent company (and potentially pursuing acquisition opportunities as an
independent company), the Board decided to continue to explore a transaction with Microchip and directed
Mr. Peterson to seek a higher price from Microchip through discussions with Mr. Sanghi.

Mr. Massengill then updated the Board regarding the review of the potential retention concerns previously
raised by certain members of management. Mr. Massengill described to the Board the information that the
Compensation Committee had received and certain compensation arrangements that it was considering.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Over the course of January 30, 2018 and January 31 2018, Mr. Peterson spoke with Mr. Sanghi to negotiate
the offer price. Separately, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke with representatives of J.P. Morgan, urging
them to encourage their client to increase the offer price. On January 31, 2018, Microchip submitted a letter
containing a “best and final” non-binding proposal to purchase all of Microsemi’s outstanding common stock at a
price of  $68.78 per share in cash, subject to Microsemi’s agreement to enter into an exclusivity agreement, a
form of which was attached to the proposal, providing for a 30-day exclusivity period.

Later that day, the Board held a meeting to review the latest Microchip proposal. Members of management
and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and O’Melveny also attended the meeting. Representatives of Qatalyst
Partners updated the Board on the status of the negotiations with Microchip and reviewed with the Board the
terms of Microchip’s most recent offer and the proposed exclusivity agreement. After discussion, the Board
unanimously resolved to authorize management to pursue Microchip’s non-binding proposal, including
negotiating and executing the exclusivity agreement, sharing further diligence information with Microchip and
negotiating a form of definitive merger agreement for the Board’s consideration.

Later that day, after negotiating certain terms, Microsemi and Microchip entered into an exclusivity
agreement. The exclusivity agreement provided that Microsemi would discontinue negotiations with other
potential bidders and negotiate exclusively with Microchip until March 1, 2018. The exclusivity agreement
included customary termination provisions and a fiduciary exception allowing Microsemi to enter into
discussions with a previously unsolicited third party if it received a proposal from that party that was more
favorable than Microchip’s proposal. That same day, representatives of Qatalyst Partners provided representatives
of J.P. Morgan with Microsemi’s January 2018 management projections.

Between February 1, 2018 and February 18, 2018, representatives of O’Melveny and Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati P.C. (which we refer to as WSGR), legal counsel to Microchip, exchanged drafts, and
negotiated the terms, of the merger agreement (including representations and warranties, interim operating
covenants, the Board’s fiduciary exceptions to the deal protection provisions, provisions related to allocation of
regulatory risk and other deal certainty related issues and the termination, termination fee and expense fee
provisions). During this period, representatives of Qatalyst Partners and J.P. Morgan had several conversations
regarding their clients’ respective positions regarding certain merger agreement terms, and Mr. Peterson and
Mr. Sanghi also had several conversations regarding various deal terms such as the termination fee, treatment of
employee equity awards in the merger and other employee retention matters associated with the merger.

On February 2, 2018, Microsemi received a written due diligence request list from Microchip, and
Microsemi provided Microchip with access to Microsemi’s virtual data room. During the remainder of
February 2018, Microsemi, Microchip and their respective advisors participated in diligence calls and Microsemi
and its advisors responded to additional due diligence requests from Microchip and its advisors. Also on
February 2, 2018, Qatalyst Partners received an inquiry from a strategic party regarding the acquisition of a
portion of Microsemi’s business. In accordance with the terms of the exclusivity letter that it had entered into
with Microchip, neither Microsemi nor any of its advisors followed up on this inquiry.

On February 13, 2018, the Compensation Committee held a meeting to continue its discussion of
management and key employee retention. The Compensation Committee reviewed certain retention arrangements
that were already in place, considered the impact of a business combination on Microsemi’s employee equity
awards, considered the importance of retaining management and key employees so that a business combination
transaction could be completed or, if there was to be no business combination, so that Microsemi could continue
to run its business, considered the employment-related risks and uncertainties that a business combination could
present, and considered possible additional retention incentives for management (other than Mr. Peterson) and
certain other key Microsemi employees. The Compensation Committee wanted to continue to consider the matter
and no formal resolutions were made at this time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Also on February 13, 2018, the Board held a meeting to discuss the progress of the negotiations with
Microchip. Members of management and representatives of O’Melveny also attended the meeting. Members of
management and representatives of O’Melveny updated the Board on the status of discussions with Microchip,
including a summary of significant issues with respect to the merger agreement and a description of the diligence
that had taken place to date.

In executive session during the February 13, 2018 Board meeting, Mr. Massengill updated the Board on the
Compensation Committee’s review of certain retention matters. The Board discussed Microsemi’s retention
arrangements that were already in place, the impact of a business combination on Microsemi’s employee equity
awards, the importance of retaining management and key employees so that a business combination could be
closed or, if there was to be no business combination, so that Microsemi could continue to run its business, the
employment-related risks and uncertainties that a business combination could present, and possible additional
retention incentives for management (other than Mr. Peterson) and certain other key Microsemi employees. After
determining that it was in the best interest of Microsemi and its stockholders to provide additional retention
arrangements for management and certain other key Microsemi employees, the Board supported, subject to
Microsemi entering into a merger agreement with Microchip and on final terms to be determined by the
Compensation Committee, additional retention incentives for Microsemi’s executive officers (other than
Mr. Peterson) in the form of New RSU Awards and, as to certain other key Microsemi employees other than
Microsemi’s executive officers, certain cash retention arrangements and certain “double trigger” severance
benefits (meaning that a business combination must close and the employee’s employment must be terminated in
certain circumstances following the closing of the business combination in order for the severance benefits to be
triggered) (we refer to these additional retention agreements collectively as the Retention Arrangements).

Over the next few days, management communicated to Microchip that the Board supported the Retention
Arrangements and its reasons for doing so. On February 15, 2018, Mr. Sanghi sent a letter to Mr. Peterson
objecting to certain aspects of the Retention Arrangements and proposing certain alternatives. Over the next few
days, Mr. Sanghi and Mr. Peterson continued to discuss the Retention Arrangements and representatives of J.P.
Morgan and a member of the Board discussed the Retention Arrangements. On February 20, 2018, Mr. Sanghi
sent a letter to Mr. Peterson in which he continued to object to certain aspects of the Retention Arrangements and
proposed certain alternatives, including reducing the merger consideration if Microsemi determined to implement
the Retention Arrangements.

On February 21, 2018, the Board held a telephonic meeting to review the status of negotiations with
Microchip. Members of management and representatives of O’Melveny and Qatalyst Partners also attended the
meeting. Mr. Peterson updated the Board on the status of the proposed transaction and his recent communications
with Mr. Sanghi, including with respect to the Retention Arrangements. Representatives of O’Melveny updated
the Board as to the status of the merger agreement negotiations, including a description of the most significant
outstanding issues (including regulatory risk allocation, termination fee, expense reimbursement fee and other
provisions related to the certainty of closing the merger) and members of the Board expressed their views on
these issues. Representatives of O’Melveny also described in detail the Microchip proposals regarding the
Retention Arrangements. The Board members agreed that a price reduction below $68.78 per share was out of the
question, and that retention of key talent remained critical to protect Microsemi and its stockholders. The Board
believed, however, that certain modifications should be made to the Retention Arrangements that could allow
Microsemi to achieve its retention goals while also accommodating certain elements of Microchip’s proposals.
After discussion, including in executive session, the Board directed management and representatives of
O’Melveny to formulate a counterproposal to Microchip’s proposal, which would cover both the Board’s views
on potentially modifying the Retention Arrangements and the most significant outstanding issues in the merger
agreement.

On February 23, 2018, the Board held a telephonic meeting to consider further the counterproposal to
Microchip’s proposal that was discussed at the Board meeting on February 21, 2018. Members of management
and representatives of O’Melveny and Qatalyst Partners also attended the meeting. Representatives of
O’Melveny reviewed the various elements of the counterproposal. After discussion and further revisions to the
response requested by the Board, the Board directed Mr. Peterson to deliver the revised counterproposal to
Mr. Sanghi, which Mr. Peterson did later that day.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

From February 23, 2018 through February 25, 2018, members of the Microsemi management team and
representatives of O’Melveny and Qatalyst Partners had conversations with Mr. Sanghi and representatives of
WSGR and J.P. Morgan, respectively, to discuss the various elements of Microsemi’s counterproposal.

On February 25, 2018, Mr. Sanghi sent an e-mail to Mr. Peterson generally accepting Microsemi’s
counterproposal, including with respect to the Retention Arrangements. Mr. Sanghi also contacted Mr. Peterson
to indicate that Microchip wanted to discuss the Retention Arrangements directly with a representative of the
Compensation Committee. Later that day, the Board held a telephonic meeting to consider Microchip’s new
proposal as outlined in the email from Mr. Sanghi to Mr. Peterson. Members of management and representatives
of O’Melveny and Qatalyst Partners also attended the meeting. Representatives of O’Melveny reviewed with the
Board each element of Microchip’s proposal. After discussion with the management team, representatives of
Qatalyst Partners and O’Melveny, the Board indicated its support of the Microchip proposal, subject to a few
clarifications, and instructed Mr. Peterson to indicate to Mr. Sanghi that Microsemi was prepared to move
forward to complete the negotiation of the merger agreement prior to the expiration of the exclusivity period on
March 1, 2018.

On February 26, 2018, Mr. Massengill held a telephone call with Mr. Sanghi to discuss generally the
Retention Arrangements and vesting of the Microsemi PSUs. During this discussion, Mr. Massengill explained
the Board’s determination of the importance of such Retention Agreements, and the PSU vesting provisions.

From February 25, 2018 to March 1, 2018, O’Melveny and WSGR continued to negotiate the terms of the
merger agreement and Microchip continued to conduct due diligence.

On February 25, 2018, February 26, 2018 and February 27, 2018, the Board held telephonic meetings to
discuss the status of negotiations with Microchip and the merger agreement. Representatives of O’Melveny and
Qatalyst Partners also attended each of these meetings.

On February 28, 2018, the Board and the Compensation Committee held a meeting to review the terms of
the proposed transaction with Microchip. Members of management and representatives of O’Melveny and
Qatalyst Partners also attended the meeting. Certain members of management and representatives of O’Melveny
and Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the Board the latest developments in the negotiations, including the
expectation that the documentation of the transaction was in nearly final form and could be completed by the
following day, March 1, 2018. A representative of O’Melveny reviewed the key terms of the merger agreement,
the Board’s fiduciary duties, including with respect to the proposed transaction, and the resolutions that the Board
would adopt if it determined to enter into the transaction. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with the
Board their financial analyses of the $68.78 per share cash consideration to be received by holders of shares of
Microsemi common stock pursuant to the merger agreement and indicated to the Board that, absent material
developments relevant to their analysis, Qatalyst Partners would be prepared to deliver an opinion on March 1,
2018, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to such holders of such consideration should the Board
decide to proceed with a transaction on the current terms. The Board directed management and representatives of
O’Melveny and Qatalyst Partners to finalize the merger agreement and related documentation.

On March 1, 2018, the Board and the Compensation Committee held a telephonic meeting to consider the
approval of the Microchip transaction. Members of management and representatives of O’Melveny and Qatalyst
Partners also attended the meeting. Representatives of O’Melveny reported that the merger agreement had been
finalized overnight and reviewed with the Board the final form of the merger agreement, including the changes
made since the version distributed to the Board on the previous day. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners again
briefly reviewed and updated the financial analyses they had discussed with the Board the prior day.
Representatives of Qatalyst Partners then rendered Qatalyst Partners’ oral opinion, which was subsequently
delivered in writing to the Board that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions, limitations,
qualifications and other matters considered in connection with such opinion, the $68.78 cash per share
consideration to be received by holders of shares of Microsemi common stock (other than Microchip and its
affiliates) pursuant to, and in accordance with, the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders. The full text of the written opinion of Qatalyst Partners, dated March 1, 2018, which sets forth,
among other things, the assumptions

operations, (ii) market prices, volatility and trading activity with respect to Microsemi common stock,
and (iii) market prices with respect to other industry participants and general market indices;

• current information regarding (i) Microsemi’s business, prospects, financial condition, operations,
technology, products, services, management, competitive position and strategic business goals and
objectives, (ii) general economic, industry and financial market conditions, and (iii) opportunities and
competitive factors within Microsemi’s industry;

• the current overall market environment, including (i) the broader equity market, (ii) the state of the
semiconductor industry, and (iii) the interest rate environment;

• the prospects and likelihood of realizing superior benefits for Microsemi through remaining an
independent company, risks associated with remaining an independent company, and possible
alternative business strategies;

• if Microsemi were to remain an independent company, the greater difficulties of finding attractive
companies to purchase and the associated difficulties in raising the capital to purchase such companies,
including Microsemi needing to issue more debt, use cash on hand, and issue equity;

• the two processes of considering strategic alternatives and contacting potential strategic parties
regarding a potential business combination transaction with Microsemi that Microsemi had engaged in
over the past two years and results of and conclusions drawn from those processes;

made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by
Qatalyst Partners in rendering their opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. See also “The
Merger — Opinion of Financial Advisor” beginning on page 44. Following further discussion, the Board
unanimously (i) determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the merger, are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Microsemi and its
stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger and (iii) resolved to recommend that Microsemi’s stockholders adopt the merger
agreement, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement.

Shortly thereafter, Microsemi, Microchip and the Merger Sub executed the merger agreement and
Microsemi and Microchip issued a joint press release announcing the transaction and the execution of the merger
agreement.

Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board

The Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

Beginning on November 13, 2017, the Board held 15 meetings at which the business strategies,
opportunities and challenges of Microsemi were evaluated and potential strategic alternatives, including a sale of
Microsemi, were considered. Microsemi’s outside legal counsel, O’Melveny, participated in each of such
meetings, and representatives of Microsemi’s financial advisor, Qatalyst Partners, participated in portions of
many of such meetings. At most of these meetings, the Board met in executive session without management
present.

The Board, at a meeting held on March 1, 2018, unanimously (i) determined that the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, are advisable and fair to and in the
best interests of Microsemi and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and (iii) resolved to recommend that Microsemi’s
stockholders adopt the merger agreement, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement.

The Board consulted with the representatives of management, O’Melveny and Qatalyst Partners at various
times and considered a number of factors, including the following principal factors (not in any relative order of
importance) that the Board believes support its decision:

• the potential for third parties to enter into strategic relationships with or to seek to acquire Microsemi,
including a review of management’s dealings with other possible buyers in the past and assessment of
the likelihood that a third party would offer a higher price than the merger consideration;

• the belief of the Board that continuing with the strategic process was unlikely to result in a transaction
at a more attractive price than offered by Microchip in the merger;

• the timing of the merger and the risk that if Microsemi did not enter into the merger agreement with
Microchip, it may not have another opportunity to do so or to pursue a comparable opportunity;

• the fact that, during the course of its negotiations with Microchip, Microchip raised the value of the
total consideration by approximately 9%, from $63.00 per share to $68.78 per share;

• the fact that Microsemi stock had recently been trading at an all-time high and that the merger
consideration represents (i) a premium of approximately 17% to $58.97 per share, the closing stock
price on January 22, 2018, the last full trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential sale
transaction involving Microsemi, (ii) a premium of approximately 23% to $56.05 per share, the six-
month volume-weighted average closing price of Microsemi’s common stock as of February 28, 2018,
the last trading day prior to the Board’s approval of the merger agreement, and (iii) a premium of
approximately 6% to $64.90 per share, the closing stock price on February 28, 2018, the last full
trading day prior to the Board’s approval of the merger agreement;

• the Board’s belief that the $68.78 per share all-cash merger consideration would (i) allow Microsemi’s
stockholders to realize in the near term a fair value, in cash, for their shares of common stock, while
avoiding the risks associated with attempting to realize the management projections, such as the
business and market trends discussed above and the need for significant investment in higher risk
initiatives and projects to improve performance, and (ii) compensate Microsemi’s stockholders not only
for the value of Microsemi’s current business and results but also for the future growth in earnings and
cash flows assuming realization of the January 2018 management projections and the successful
implementation of such initiatives and projects;

• the fact that Microsemi would be permitted, under circumstances described in the merger agreement, to
terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal
after giving Microchip the opportunity to match the superior proposal and upon payment of a
termination fee equal to $290,000,000;

• that none of Party A, Party B, Party C or Party D would be subject to standstill obligations that would
prohibit them from making an unsolicited proposal to the Board following announcement of entry into
the merger agreement;

• the likelihood that the merger would be completed, including:

• the fact that, under the terms of the merger agreement, Microchip has agreed to use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
law (including making filings pursuant to antitrust related laws and, if necessary, making
divestitures and taking other actions in order to obtain approvals under applicable law) to
consummate the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as promptly
as practicable so long as such divestitures and other actions would not result in a material adverse
effect of the Company or a material adverse effect on the business, operations, financial condition
or results of operations of Microchip and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

• the belief of the Board that, although antitrust filings or notifications will be required to be made
in the U.S., Austria, China, Japan, Germany, the Philippines and Taiwan, the merger has a
reasonable likelihood of closing without any material issues under applicable antitrust laws or
from any Governmental Authorities that would prevent the consummation of the merger; and

• the fact that Microchip’s obligation to complete the merger and pay the merger consideration is
not conditioned on Microchip obtaining financing and is subject to specific performance under the
terms of the merger agreement.

• the opinion of Qatalyst Partners, dated March 1, 2018, that, as of the date of such opinion and subject
to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other matters considered in connection with such
opinion, the $68.78 per share cash consideration to be received by holders of shares of Microsemi
common stock (other than Microchip or any affiliates of Microchip) pursuant to, and in accordance
with, the terms of the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The
full text of the written opinion of Qatalyst Partners, dated March 1, 2018, which sets forth, among other
things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and
qualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion, is attached as
Annex B to this proxy statement; and

• the rights of Microsemi stockholders to demand appraisal of their shares and receive payment of the
“fair value” of such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL if they comply in all respects with
Section 262 of the DGCL, and the absence of any closing conditions in the merger agreement related to
the exercise of appraisal rights by Microsemi stockholders.

• the fact that Microsemi will no longer exist as an independent public company and Microsemi’s
stockholders will forego any future increase in its value as an independent public company that might
result from its possible growth;

• the possible negative effect of the merger and public announcement of the merger on Microsemi’s
financial performance, operating results and stock price and Microsemi’s relationships with customers,
suppliers, distributors, other business partners, management and employees;

• the fact that the merger agreement (i) precludes Microsemi from actively soliciting competing
acquisition proposals and (ii) obligates Microsemi (or its successor) to pay Microchip a termination fee
equal to $290,000,000 under specified circumstances, which could discourage the making of a
competing acquisition proposal or adversely impact the price offered in such a proposal;

• the fact that the merger agreement imposes restrictions on the conduct of Microsemi’s business in the
pre-closing period, which may adversely affect Microsemi’s business in the event the merger is not
completed (including by delaying or preventing Microsemi from pursuing business opportunities that
may arise or precluding actions that would be advisable if Microsemi were to remain an independent
company);

• the risks involved with the merger and the likelihood that Microsemi and Microchip will be able to
complete the merger, the possibility that the merger might never be consummated (including because of
failure to obtain the required antitrust clearances) and Microsemi’s prospects going forward without the
combination with Microchip;

• the substantial transaction expenses to be incurred in connection with the merger and the negative
impact of such expenses on Microsemi’s cash reserves and operating results should the merger not be
completed;

• the fact that if the merger agreement is terminated because Microsemi’s stockholders do not adopt the
merger agreement at a meeting called for that purpose, Microsemi will be obligated to reimburse
Microchip for its expenses up to $35,000,000;

• the fact that while Microchip’s obligation to complete the merger and pay the merger consideration is
not conditioned on Microchip obtaining financing, the amount of cash required for Microchip to
complete the merger is significant; and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered a variety of risks and factors weighing against
the merger, including:

• all known interests of directors and executive officers of Microsemi in the merger that may be different
from, or in addition to, their interests as stockholders of Microsemi or the interests of Microsemi’s
other stockholders generally.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Certain Company Forecasts

Although Microsemi has publicly issued limited short-term guidance concerning certain aspects of its
expected financial performance, it does not, as a matter of course, make public disclosure of detailed forecasts or
projections of its expected financial performance for extended periods due to, among other things, the
uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in
connection with Microsemi’s evaluation of strategic alternatives and a possible business combination transaction
involving Microsemi, in early December 2017, Microsemi prepared certain projections and estimates of future
financial and operating performance with respect to Microsemi’s second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year
2018, fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020 (which we refer to as the December 2017 management projections),
which it made available to the parties that had expressed interest in a business combination with Microsemi at
that time (Microchip, Party B, Party C and Party D) as well as the Board and Qatalyst Partners. In late
January 2018, to account for changes in U.S. tax laws and Microsemi’s actual results for the first quarter of its
fiscal year 2018, Microsemi prepared updated financial projections and estimates of future financial and
operating performance for its fiscal years 2018 through 2023, including the calendar year ending December 31,
2018 (which we refer to as the January 2018 management projections), which it made available to the Board and
Qatalyst Partners. A subset of the January 2018 management projections, consisting of certain prospective
financial information with respect to the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2018, fiscal year 2019
and fiscal year 2020, was also made available to Microchip to assist with its due diligence review.

A summary of the December 2017 management projections and January 2018 management projections
(which, together, we refer to as the management projections), is being included in this proxy statement because
subsets of the management projections were made available to Microchip, Party B, Party C and Party D. This
information is not intended to influence your decision whether to vote for or against the merger proposal. The
inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the Board, its advisors or any other
person considered, or now considers, the management projections to be material or to be a reliable prediction of
actual future results, and the management projections should not be relied upon as such. The management
projections are subjective in many respects. There can be no assurance that the management projections will be
realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than forecasted. The management
projections cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes subject to greater uncertainty with
each successive year. As a result, the inclusion of the management projections in this proxy statement should not
be relied on as necessarily predictive of actual future events.

The management projections were prepared on a stand-alone basis and do not take into account any of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger and associated expenses, or
Microsemi’s compliance with its covenants under the merger agreement. For these reasons and for the reasons
described above, actual results likely will differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the
management projections.

The management projections have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Microsemi’s management

to Microsemi’s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to management projections and should
not be read to do so. Further, the management projections include non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP
financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be considered as a supplement to, not a
substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Although the management projections presented below are presented with numerical specificity, they are
estimates of future performance and not historical facts. The management projections were based on numerous
variables and assumptions that were deemed to be reasonable as of the respective dates when such projections
were finalized. Realization of such assumptions is inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of
Microsemi. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the management projections not to be
achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Microsemi’s business (including,
without limitation, its ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets), industry performance, the legal
and regulatory environment, general business and economic conditions and other factors described or referenced
under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 21. In the view of
Microsemi’s management, the management projections were prepared on a reasonable basis based on the best
information available to Microsemi’s management during the timeframe around their preparation. In addition, the
assumptions underlying the management projections are subject to change and have not been revised since their
preparation to reflect any changes in Microsemi’s business, industry performance, the legal or regulatory
environment, general business or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that
may occur and that was not anticipated as the management projections were prepared. Neither Microsemi nor
Microchip undertakes any obligation, except as required by law, to update or otherwise revise the management
projections to reflect circumstances existing since their preparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated
events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error or to not be
appropriate, or to reflect changes in Microsemi’s business, industry performance, the legal or regulatory
environment, or general business or economic conditions. There can be no assurance that the management
projections will be realized or that Microsemi’s future financial results will not materially vary from the
management projections.

The following is a summary of the December 2017 management projections prepared by Microsemi’s
management and provided to Microchip, Party B, Party C and Party D as well as the Board and Qatalyst Partners.

Opinion of Financial Advisor

Microsemi retained Qatalyst Partners to act as financial advisor to the Board in connection with a potential
transaction such as the merger and to evaluate whether the cash consideration to be received by the holders of
Microsemi common stock, other than Microchip or any affiliate of Microchip, pursuant to, and in accordance
with, the terms of the merger agreement, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Microsemi
selected Qatalyst Partners to act as its financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners’ qualifications, expertise,
reputation and knowledge of the business and affairs of Microsemi and the industry in which Microsemi operates.
Qatalyst Partners provided its written consent to the reproduction of its opinion in this proxy statement. At the
meeting of the Board on March 1, 2018, Qatalyst Partners rendered its oral opinion that, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the various assumptions, considerations, limitations and other matters set forth therein,
the merger consideration to be received by the holders of Microsemi common stock, other than Microchip or any
affiliate of Microchip, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders. Following the meeting, Qatalyst Partners delivered its written opinion,
dated March 1, 2018, to the Board.

The full text of Qatalyst Partners’ written opinion, dated March 1, 2018, is attached hereto as Annex B and
is incorporated by reference herein. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst
Partners in rendering its opinion. You should read the opinion carefully in its entirety. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion
was provided to the Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the merger consideration to be received by the holders of Microsemi common stock, other than
Microchip or any affiliate of Microchip, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement,
and it does not address any other aspect of the merger. It does not constitute a recommendation to any Microsemi
stockholder as to how to vote with respect to the merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address
the prices at which shares of Microsemi common stock will trade at any time. The summary of Qatalyst Partners’
opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed a draft merger agreement dated March 1, 2018, certain
related documents and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial
information of Microsemi. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to
Microsemi prepared by the management of Microsemi, including financial projections and operating data of
Microsemi summarized in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Certain Company Forecasts”
(collectively with such other forward-looking information, the “Company Projections”). Additionally, Qatalyst
Partners discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Microsemi with
senior executives of Microsemi. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity
for Microsemi common stock and compared the financial performance of Microsemi and the prices and trading
activity of Microsemi common stock with

• adding:

• the implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows of Microsemi,

that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners
reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed
such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Qatalyst Partners
deemed appropriate.

In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available
to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by Microsemi. With respect to the Company Projections, Qatalyst
Partners was advised by the management of Microsemi, and assumed, that they had been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Microsemi of the
future financial performance of Microsemi and other matters covered thereby, including that they reflect the
assessment of the management of Microsemi as to the existing and future technology and products of Microsemi
and the risks associated with such technology and products. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the merger would be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the draft merger agreement dated March 1, 2018, without
any modification, waiver or delay that would be material to Qatalyst Partners’ analysis. Qatalyst Partners also
assumed that the final executed merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft merger
agreement dated March 1, 2018, which was reviewed by Qatalyst Partners. In addition, Qatalyst Partners
assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed merger, no delays,
limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Microsemi
stockholders receiving the merger consideration and that would be material to Qatalyst Partners’ analysis.
Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) of Microsemi, nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Qatalyst
Partners’ opinion has been approved by Qatalyst Partners’ opinion committee in accordance with its customary
practice.

Qatalyst Partners’ opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in
effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after the date of
the opinion may affect Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners
did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners’ opinion does not
address the underlying business decision of Microsemi to engage in the merger, or the relative merits of the
merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Microsemi. The opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by the Microsemi stockholders
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement, and Qatalyst Partners expressed no
opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of Microsemi’s officers,
directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to such merger consideration.

The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with
its opinion dated March 1, 2018. The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole;
considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Qatalyst Partners’ opinion. For purposes of its analyses,
Qatalyst Partners utilized the January 2018 management projections. Some of the summaries of the financial
analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order
to more fully understand the financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with
the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners’ financial analyses.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a
potential, present value of share values for the Microsemi common stock as of December 31, 2017 by:

• the implied present value of the corresponding terminal value of Microsemi at October 1, 2022,
calculated by multiplying Microsemi’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (“EBITDA”) in fiscal year 2023, based on the Company Projections, by a range of
multiples of diluted enterprise value to estimated forward EBITDA of 10.0x to 13.0x, and
discounted to present value (from October 1, 2022) using the same range of discount rates used in
the bullet point above;

• subtracting estimated debt outstanding (including the payment obligation related to the Series A-1
Special Shares and Series B-1 Special Shares of a Canadian subsidiary of Microsemi (the “Special
Shares”), net of the estimated cash balance, of Microsemi as of December 31, 2017, as provided by
Microsemi’s management;

• applying a dilution factor of approximately 9.7%, as projected by Microsemi’s management, to reflect
the dilution to the Microsemi stockholders over the projection period due to the effect of future
issuances by Microsemi of equity awards; and

• dividing the resulting amount by the number of diluted shares of Microsemi common stock outstanding
(calculated using the treasury stock method), taking into account outstanding PSUs (based on the
midpoint between target and maximum allowable for each of the applicable performance periods),
stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights and shares of Microsemi common stock held in treasury
in connection with the potential exchange or retraction (i.e.redemption at the option of the holder of the
Special Shares), as of February 27, 2018, as provided by Microsemi’s management (such number of
diluted shares, Microsemi’s “Diluted Share Count”).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

based on the Company Projections, and excluding the impact of stock-based compensation
expense, for the period beginning with the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year
2022 (which implied present value was calculated by using a mid-period discount convention and
a range of discount rates of 9.5% to 12.0%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital
for Microsemi); and

Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of values for the Microsemi common
stock of approximately $57.03 per share to $80.28 per share.

Selected Companies Analysis

Qatalyst Partners compared selected financial information and public market multiples for Microsemi with
publicly available information and public market multiples for selected companies. The companies used in this
comparison included those companies listed below, which were selected from publicly traded companies in the
semiconductor industry by Qatalyst Partners based on its professional judgment, which included such factors as
companies participating in similar lines of businesses to Microsemi, having similar financial performance, or
having other relevant or similar characteristics.

Based upon research analyst consensus estimates for calendar year 2018 as of February 28, 2018 and using
the closing prices as of February 28, 2018 for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners calculated,
among other things, the implied diluted enterprise value (“EV”) divided by the estimated calendar year 2018
EBITDA (the “CY2018E EBITDA Multiples”), and the ratio of price to earnings per share (“P/E Ratio”) for
calendar year 2018 (the “CY2018E P/E Multiples”) for each of the selected companies below:

Qatalyst Partners also calculated the implied P/E Ratio for the next twelve months at each trading date for
the period between January 3, 2011 and January 22, 2018 (the “Company P/E Multiples”) (and the annual
average of such Company P/E Multiples was 9.6x in 2011, 8.6x in 2012, 10.8x in 2013, 10.0x in 2014, 11.3x in
2015, 11.1x in 2016, and 12.6x in 2017). The CY2018E EBITDA Multiple and CY2018E P/E Multiple for the
Company was 12.5x and 13.3x, respectively, based on research analyst consensus estimates for calendar year
2018 as of February 28, 2018 (the “Street Case”) and the Company’s closing price as of January 22, 2018.

Based on an analysis of the CY2018E EBITDA Multiples for the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners

calculations set forth above, then subtracting the net debt of the Company (including the payment obligation
related to the Special Shares) as of December 31, 2017 and then dividing the resulting amount by the Company’s
Diluted Share Count, this analysis implied a range of values for the Company’s common stock of approximately
$44.24 per share to $61.64 per share based on the Street Case and $44.95 per share to $62.55 per share based on
the Company Projections.

Based on an analysis of the CY2018E P/E Multiples for the selected companies and the Company P/E
Multiples, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of 11.0x to 16.0x and applied this range to the
Company’s estimated CY2018E diluted earnings per share (1) based on the Street Case and (2) based on the
Company Projections. Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of values for the
Company’s common stock of approximately $48.76 per share to $70.93 per share based on the Street Case and
$49.50 per share to $72.00 per share based on the Company Projections.

No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to Microsemi. In evaluating the
selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond
the control of Microsemi, such as the impact of competition on Microsemi’s business and the industry in general,
industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in Microsemi’s financial condition and
prospects, or the industry or in the financial markets in general. Because of the unique circumstances of each of
these companies and Microsemi, Qatalyst Partners cautioned against placing undue reliance on this information.

Selected Transactions Analysis
Qatalyst Partners compared 25 selected transactions involving companies in the semiconductor industry

announced between January 2011 and February 2018, including transactions involving companies participating in

For each of the transactions listed above, Qatalyst Partners reviewed, among other things, the implied
diluted enterprise value of the target company as a multiple of analyst estimates of the next-twelve-months
EBITDA of the target company, as of the date of the announcement of the applicable transaction. Based on the
analysis of such metrics for the transactions noted above, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of
12.0x to 15.5x applied to Microsemi’s estimated next-twelve-months EBITDA (based on the Street Case). Based
on the calculations set forth above, then subtracting the net debt of Microsemi (including the payment obligation
related to the Special Shares) as of December 31, 2017, and then dividing the resulting amount by the sum of
Microsemi’s Diluted Share Count plus an additional approximately 140,000 RSUs (as provided by Microsemi’s
management) to be granted to certain executives of Microsemi in connection with the merger (see the section of
this proxy statement captioned “Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger”), this analysis implied a range of
values for the Microsemi common stock of approximately $55.94 per share to $76.04 per share.

For each of the transactions listed above, Qatalyst Partners also reviewed, among other things, the analyst
estimates of the next-twelve-months P/E Ratio of the target company. Based on the analysis of such metrics for
the transactions noted above, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range of 15.0x to 19.0x applied to
Microsemi’s estimated next-twelve-months diluted earnings per share (based on the Street Case). Based on the
calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of values for the Microsemi common stock of
approximately $66.50 per share to $84.23 per share.

No company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to Microsemi or the
merger. In evaluating the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to
general business, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond
Microsemi’s control, such as the impact of competition on Microsemi’s business or the industry in general,
industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in Microsemi’s financial condition and
prospects, or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the
companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to which they are being compared. Because of the unique
circumstances of each of these transactions and the merger, Qatalyst Partners cautioned against placing undue
reliance on this information.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Miscellaneous

In connection with the review of the merger by the Board, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial
and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a
complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any
particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its
analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the
process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have given various analyses and
factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or
less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis
described above should not be taken to be Qatalyst Partners’ view of the actual value of Microsemi. In
performing its analyses, Qatalyst Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond
Microsemi’s control. Any estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners’ analyses are not necessarily indicative of
future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such
estimates.

Qatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by the holders of Microsemi common stock,
other than Microchip or any affiliate of Microchip, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger
agreement. This analysis does not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the prices at which Microsemi common
stock might actually trade.

Qatalyst Partners’ opinion and its presentation to the Board was one of many factors considered by the
Board in deciding to approve the merger agreement. Consequently, the analyses as described above should not be
viewed as determinative of  (i) the opinion of the Board with respect to the cash consideration to be received by
the holders of Microsemi common stock in the merger, other than Microchip or any affiliate of Microchip,
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the merger agreement, or (ii) of whether the Board would have
been willing to agree to different consideration. The merger consideration was determined through arm’s length
negotiations between Microsemi and Microchip and was approved by the Board. Qatalyst Partners provided
advice to Microsemi during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however, recommend any specific
consideration to Microsemi or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for
the merger.

Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of corporations and
individuals, domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary
course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may
trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of Microsemi, Microchip or certain of
their respective affiliates. During the two year period prior to March 1, 2018, the date of Qatalyst Partners’
opinion, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and Microsemi or
Microchip pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates. Qatalyst Partners
and its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to Microsemi or
Microchip or any of their respective affiliates for which it would expect to receive compensation.

Under the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided Microsemi with financial advisory
services in connection with the merger for which it will be paid approximately $65 million, $250,000 of which
became payable upon the execution of its engagement letter, $5 million of which became payable upon delivery
of its opinion, and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, the completion of the merger.
Microsemi has also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for certain expenses incurred in performing its services.
Microsemi has also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors,
officers, partners, agents and employees and any person controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates
against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, and expenses related to or
arising out of Qatalyst Partners’ engagement.

• The commitments in respect of the backstop revolving credit facility terminate upon the obtaining of
the required approvals and the effectiveness of the amendment to Microchip’s existing credit agreement
to effect such required approvals.

• The commitments in respect of the new term loan B facility will be reduced by 100% of the net cash
proceeds received by Microchip or its subsidiaries prior to the closing date from (1) the sale or issuance
of secured or unsecured senior notes by Microchip and (2) equity securities issued by Microchip,
subject to certain exceptions.

• Microchip has the right to reduce the amount of commitments under the new bridge facility subject to
(1) compliance with any applicable requirements of the merger agreement and (2) the reasonable
satisfaction of the lead arranger for the new bridge facility that Microchip will have sufficient liquidity
on a pro forma basis immediately after giving effect to such reduction and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the commitment letter.

• execution of final customary documentation;

• delivery of a solvency certificate in a pre-agreed form by the chief financial officer of Microchip;

• absence of any “Company Material Adverse Effect” (as defined in the merger agreement) since
December 31, 2017;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Financing of the Merger

Microchip and Merger Sub estimate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be approximately $10.15 billion, which will be
funded through a combination of debt financing under the debt commitment letter described below, debt incurred
under Microchip’s existing revolving line of credit, the issuance of a new term loan B facility, and Microchip’s
and Microsemi’s cash and cash equivalents on hand at closing. This amount includes the funds needed to (1) pay
Microsemi’s stockholders the amounts due to them under the merger agreement, (2) make payments in respect of
Microsemi’s outstanding equity-based awards pursuant to the merger agreement, (3) refinance or otherwise
discharge outstanding indebtedness of Microsemi under Microsemi’s existing credit agreement and Microsemi’s
9.125% senior notes due 2023, and (4) pay related fees, expenses and taxes.

On March 1, 2018, in connection with executing the merger agreement, Microchip entered into a
commitment letter (the “commitment letter”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the “new lender”) pursuant to
which the new lender committed to provide to Microchip (1) a new senior secured revolving credit facility of up
to $3.122 billion (the “backstop revolving credit facility”) in the event that specified amendments to Microchip’s
existing credit agreement are not obtained (the “required approvals”), (2) a new senior secured term loan facility
of up to $5.0 billion (the “new term loan B facility”) and (3) a new 364-day secured bridge facility of up to
$625.0 million (the “new bridge facility” and, together with the new revolving facility and the new term loan B
facility, the “new credit facilities”), in each case, subject to the execution of definitive documentation and
customary closing conditions. Microchip expects to enter into definitive documentation for the amendments to
Microchip’s existing credit agreement to reflect the require approvals as soon as practicable after such required
approvals are obtained and for the new credit facilities concurrently with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

The commitment letter and the commitments under the commitment letter expire if  (1) the initial borrowing
under the new credit facilities does not occur on or before the “Termination Date” (as defined in the merger
agreement), as such date may be extended pursuant to the terms of Section 8.1(d) of the merger agreement,
(2) the merger agreement is terminated without the funding of the new credit facilities, or (3) the closing of the
merger occurs without the use of the new credit facilities. In addition, the commitments of the new lender under
the commitment letter may be reduced or terminated as follows:

The availability of the new credit facilities is conditioned on the consummation of Microchip’s acquisition
of Microsemi in all material respects in accordance with the merger agreement, and other conditions including,
but not limited to the following (subject, in each case, to customary “certain funds” provisions):

• delivery of certain financial statements (including pro forma financial statements) and forecasts by
Microchip;

• accuracy of specified representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and the accuracy in all
material respects of specified representations and warranties to be contained in the definitive
documentation for the new credit facilities;

• delivery of documentation and other information about Microchip and its subsidiaries who are
guarantors required under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations (including the PATRIOT Act);

• payment of certain fees and expenses;

• subject to certain limitations, the taking of certain actions necessary to establish and perfect a priority
security interest in specified items of collateral; and

• the lead arrangers shall have received information required to prepare a customary confidential
information memorandum for the credit facilities and been afforded a period at least 20 consecutive
business days (subject to certain blackout periods) after the delivery of the information required to
prepare a customary confidential information memorandum to syndicate the new credit facilities and
solicit the required approvals.

(1) Amounts in millions, except percentages.

(2) The Base Rate and the Eurocurrency Rate are based on such rates as published on April 16, 2018.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Microchip’s existing credit agreement will mature on February 4, 2020 unless the lenders thereunder agree
to Microchip’s request to amend the existing credit agreement to extend the maturity date. The backstop
revolving facility will mature on February 4, 2020 and the new bridge facility will mature 364 days after the
closing date. The new term loan B facility is expected to mature seven years after the closing date.

Under the new credit facilities, Microchip will be able to borrow under a “Base Rate” which approximates
the prime rate plus an applicable margin or “Eurocurrency Rate” which approximates LIBOR plus an applicable
margin. Microchip expects the applicable margin under its existing credit agreement or the backstop revolving
facility, as applicable, to range from 0.25% to 1.25%, in the case of Base Rate loans, and 1.25% to 2.25%, in the
case of Eurocurrency Rate loans, in each case based on Microchip’s leverage ratio. Initially, the applicable margin
is expected to be 2.25% in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 1.25% in the case of Base Rate loans.
Microchip expects the loans under the new term loan B facility to have an applicable margin of 2.25% in the case
of Eurocurrency Rate loans and 1.25% in the case of Base Rate loans. Commitments under the existing revolving
credit facility or the backstop revolving facility, as applicable, will be subject to an undrawn commitment fee
ranging from 0.20% to 0.40% based on Microchip’s leverage ratio. Loans under the new bridge facility would
accrue interest at the Base Rate plus an applicable margin of 0.50% or the Eurocurrency Rate plus an applicable
margin of 1.50%, with such margins increasing by 0.25% 90 days after the closing date and an additional 0.25%
each 90 days thereafter.

At closing of the new credit facilities, Microchip expects the principal amounts outstanding to be
Eurocurrency Rate loans and interest rate information to be as follows (amounts in millions, except percentages):

Principal 
Outstanding

Base 
Rate

Base Rate 
Margin

Eurocurrency 
Rate

Eurodollar Rate 
Margin

Revolving Credit Facility (existing or backstop) $3,000 4.75 1.25 2.36 2.25
New Term Loan B Facility $5,000 4.75 1.25 2.36 2.25
New Bridge Facility $ 625 4.75 0.50 2.36 1.50

For purposes of the foregoing, we have assumed that Microchip will receive $5 billion aggregate net cash
proceeds from the new term loan B facility prior to the closing date and that Microchip will borrow up to $625
million under the new bridge facility, if needed.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The obligations under the new credit facilities will be Microchip’s and the guarantors’ senior secured
obligations, secured by a lien on substantially all of Microchip’s and the guarantor’s assets (collectively, the
“collateral”) and will rank senior to any of its and the guarantors’ unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the
value of the collateral.

The new credit facilities will contain representations and warranties, covenants and events of default
substantially similar to Microchip’s existing credit agreement, subject to such additional exceptions as may be
necessary or reasonably requested by Microchip in connection with the acquisition. The new credit facilities will
contain financial maintenance covenants, including (i) a maximum total leverage ratio as of the last day of any
fiscal quarter not to exceed 6.75 to 1.00; subject to certain step-downs on the first and second anniversary of the
closing date; (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio as of the last day of any fiscal quarter shall not be less than
3.25 to 1.00; and (iii) a maximum senior leverage ratio as the last day of any fiscal quarter not to exceed 4.75 to
1.00, subject to certain step-downs on the first and second anniversary of the closing date. The new credit
facilities will also contain restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of Microchip’s
subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, and that limit the ability of Microchip and its subsidiaries to pay
dividends, make distributions or make other restricted payments, make certain investments, create restrictions on
distributions from subsidiaries, engage in sale leaseback transactions, amend the terms of certain other
indebtedness, create liens, sell assets, consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
or their respective assets, and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. The new credit facilities also will
contain customary events of default, among other things, including the failure to make timely payments under the
new credit facilities or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy certain covenants, the occurrence of a
change of control and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency.

Microchip has agreed to use, and to cause its subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to consummate the
debt financing on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the commitment letter. If any portion of the
debt financing (including after giving effect to the exercise of any “market flex” provisions contained in the
commitment letter or any other agreements entered into in connection therewith) becomes unavailable to
Microchip on the terms and conditions contemplated by the commitment letter, (1) Microchip must promptly
notify Microsemi, and (2) Microchip must use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing on terms
and conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Microchip than those set forth in the commitment
letter and in an amount at least equal to the amount (taking into account cash on hand and other sources of funds
available to Microchip) required to consummate the merger. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — 
Financing,” beginning on page 77 of this proxy statement.

As of the date of this proxy statement, no alternative financing arrangements or alternative financing plans
have been made in the event that the new credit facilities are not available. The availability of the new credit
facilities is subject to certain conditions but is not subject to due diligence or other similar conditions. Further, the
commitment letter contains customary “certain funds” provisions which materially limit the number and scope of
conditions precedent to the funding of the new credit facilities on the closing date. However, such financing may
not be considered certain.

The definitive documentation governing the new credit facilities has not been finalized and, accordingly, the
actual terms of the new credit facilities may differ from those described in this proxy statement.

Microsemi cannot assure you that the amounts committed under the commitment letter, together with
Microchip’s and Microsemi’s combined cash and cash equivalents on hand, will be sufficient to consummate the
merger. Those amounts might be insufficient if, among other things, one or more of the parties to the commitment
letter fail to fund the committed amounts in breach of such financing commitments or if the conditions to such
commitments are not met. Although obtaining the proceeds of any financing, including the financing under the
commitment letter, is not a condition to the consummation of the merger, the failure of Microchip and Merger
Sub to obtain any portion of the debt financing (or any alternative financing) may result in the failure of the
merger to be completed.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
Assuming receipt of required regulatory approvals and timely satisfaction of other closing conditions,

including the approval by our stockholders of the merger proposal, we currently expect the closing of the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

merger to occur in June 2018. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Closing and Effective Time of
the Merger” beginning on page 64.

The effective time of the merger will occur upon a certificate of merger having been duly filed with and
accepted by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as Microsemi and Microchip
may agree in writing and is specified in the certificate of merger).

Payment of Merger Consideration and Surrender of Stock Certificates

At or prior to the effective time of the merger, Microchip will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with the
payment agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of our common stock, a cash amount necessary to pay the
aggregate merger consideration payable to our stockholders and, to the extent not previously deposited by
Microsemi with another financial institution, the consideration payable to our equity-based and performance-
based award holders as a result of the merger.

Promptly after the effective time of the merger, and in any event within five business days thereafter,
Microchip and the surviving corporation will cause the payment agent to mail (i) to each of our stockholders of
record immediately prior to the effective time of the merger who hold certificated shares of our common stock
(other than holders of excluded shares and dissenting shares) (A) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery
will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon the delivery of the certificates representing shares
of our common stock (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates as provided in the merger agreement) to the
payment agent, and (B) instructions advising each such holder of record how to surrender his, her or its shares of
our common stock in exchange for the merger consideration, and (ii) to each of our stockholders of record
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger who hold uncertificated shares of our common stock (other
than holders of excluded shares and dissenting shares), a notice that the merger has become effective. The
payment agent will pay each holder of record the aggregate merger consideration to which such holder is entitled
(i) in the case of certificated shares, after delivery or transfer of such shares by holders of certificated shares and
(ii) in the case of uncertificated shares, without any action on the part of the person in whose name such
uncertificated shares are registered. Interest will not be paid or accrue in respect of the merger consideration.
From the effective time until the surrender or transfer of certificates or book-entry shares, as the case may be,
each such certificate or book-entry share will represent only the right to receive in exchange therefor a cash
amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) equal to the merger consideration.

In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares that is not registered in the transfer records of Microsemi, a
cash amount equal to the merger consideration upon due surrender of the certificates may be paid to such
transferee if the certificates formerly representing such shares are presented to the payment agent, accompanied
by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable
stock transfer or other similar taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

You should not return any stock certificates you hold with the enclosed proxy card, and you should
not forward any stock certificates to the payment agent without a letter of transmittal.

Any holder of uncertificated shares will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the payment agent to receive the merger consideration that such holder is entitled to receive.
Microchip will cause the payment agent to pay and deliver, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
effective time of the merger, the merger consideration in respect of such uncertificated shares (and such shares
will be cancelled).

From and after the effective time of the merger, there will be no further transfers of shares of our common
stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

If any cash deposited with the payment agent remains unclaimed for one year following the effective time of
the merger, such cash will be delivered to Microchip. Thereafter, holders of our common stock (other than
holders of excluded shares) who have not received payment due to non-compliance with the exchange procedures
will be entitled to look only to Microchip with respect to payment of the merger consideration (after giving effect
to any required tax withholdings), without any interest thereon.

If you have lost a certificate, or if it has been stolen or destroyed, then before you will be entitled to
receive the merger consideration, you will be required to provide an affidavit of the loss, theft or
destruction, and, if

• Unvested RSUs.   At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi RSU award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, to the extent unvested (after giving effect to any
acceleration of vesting in connection with the merger pursuant to the terms of the award), will be
assumed by Microchip and converted into a Microchip RSU, with the number of shares of Microchip
common stock subject to assumed RSUs equal to the product of  (i) the number of shares of Microsemi
common stock subject to the unvested Microsemi RSU award as of immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger and (ii) the equity award exchange ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share).
Each assumed RSU will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to
such award immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, including the same vesting schedule
and any applicable accelerated vesting provisions.

• Vested RSUs.   At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi RSU award that is outstanding and
unsettled immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and that is vested or will vest in
connection with the merger pursuant to the terms of the award will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) an amount in cash equal to the
number of shares subject to the vested RSU award multiplied by $68.78.

required by Microchip, post a bond in a reasonable amount and upon reasonable terms as may be required
by the payment agent, Microchip and the surviving corporation as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Microchip, the surviving corporation or the payment agent with respect to such
certificate. These procedures will be described in the letter of transmittal and related instructions that you
will receive, which you should read carefully and in their entirety.

Microchip, Microsemi, Merger Sub, the surviving corporation and the payment agent will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the merger consideration such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. Any sum
that is withheld will be remitted to the appropriate taxing authority, and will be treated for all purposes of the
merger agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares with regard to whom it is deducted and withheld.

The merger consideration paid upon the surrender of certificates or transfer of uncertificated shares in
accordance with the exchange procedures will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares so surrendered or transferred.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to adopt the merger agreement, you should be

aware that aside from their interests as Microsemi stockholders, Microsemi’s directors and executive officers
have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Microsemi stockholders
generally. Members of the Board were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in
evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending to Microsemi
stockholders that the merger agreement be adopted. For more information, see the sections entitled “The Merger 
— Background of the Merger” beginning on page 29 and “The Merger — Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Board” beginning on page 38. These interests are described in more detail below, and
certain of them are quantified in the narrative and in the section entitled “Non-Binding, Advisory Vote on
Merger-Related Compensation for Microsemi’s Named Executive Officers — Golden Parachute Compensation”
beginning on page 85.

Treatment of Outstanding Equity-Based and Performance Awards
The Microsemi RSUs, PSUs, and Restricted Stock (which we collectively refer to as Microsemi equity

awards), held by Microsemi’s executive officers immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
treated in the same manner as those Microsemi equity awards held by other employees of Microsemi.
Microsemi’s executive officers do not hold any Microsemi stock options or stock appreciation rights awards.
Microsemi’s non-employee directors do not hold any unvested Microsemi equity awards and only hold vested
shares of Microsemi common stock. As described further in the section titled “The Merger Agreement — 
Treatment of Common Stock, Stock-Based Awards and Performance Awards” beginning on page 65, Microsemi
equity awards will be subject to the following treatment:

• PSUs.   At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi PSU award outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger will be vested immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
as to a percentage of the total number of shares of Microsemi common stock subject to the award as
determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board (which percentage will in no event be less
than 100% of the target number of shares subject to the award or greater than the maximum possible
vesting percentage under the terms of the award). Each such vested Microsemi PSU will be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) an
amount in cash equal to the number of vested PSUs (after giving effect to the foregoing determination
by the Compensation Committee) multiplied by $68.78.

• Restricted Stock.   At the effective time of the merger, each share of Microsemi Restricted Stock will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $68.78 (less applicable
withholding taxes), which will be subject to the same vesting requirements and other terms and
conditions that were applicable to such Restricted Stock award immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger (including any vesting or acceleration provisions provided with respect to the award).
The cash amount will be paid on or reasonably promptly after the applicable vesting date.

• Non-US Company Compensatory Awards.   Microsemi and Microchip may, prior to the effective time
of the merger, agree that any outstanding stock option, stock appreciation right, RSU, PSU or
Restricted Stock award that is subject to the laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction be treated in a manner other
than as set forth above, to the extent that Microsemi and Microchip reasonably and in good faith
determine that (A) the manner in which such award would otherwise be treated would result in a
violation of applicable laws or a materially adverse tax consequence to the individual holding such
award in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction, (B) such different treatment is necessary to comply with
such applicable laws and (C) such different treatment is, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent
with the applicable provisions of the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Assuming the merger was completed on March 30, 2018, the estimated aggregate amount that would be
payable to Microsemi’s executive officers as a group for their Microsemi equity awards is as follows: (a) with
respect to Microsemi vested RSUs (including RSUs that will vest in connection with the merger), $0 and (b) with
respect to Microsemi vested PSUs, other than the PSUs granted to Mr. Peterson in July 2016, (including PSUs
that will vest in connection with the merger), $23,244,269 (assuming the PSUs vest as to 100% of the target
number of shares subject to the award) or $97,489,116 (assuming the PSUs vest as to the maximum number of
PSUs subject to the award). As noted above, the number of PSUs that vest in connection with the merger, other
than the PSUs granted to Mr. Peterson in July 2016, will be determined based on a vesting percentage determined
prior to the effective time of the merger by the Compensation Committee of the Board (which percentage will in
no event be less than 100% of the target number of shares subject to the award or greater than the maximum
possible vesting percentage under the terms of the award). As noted above, Microsemi’s executive officers do not
currently hold any Microsemi stock options or stock appreciation rights. Also, as noted above, Microsemi’s non-
employee directors do not hold any unvested Microsemi equity awards.

For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Microsemi’s executive officers in
connection with any acceleration of their Microsemi equity awards, see the section entitled “Non-Binding,
Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for Microsemi’s Named Executive Officers — Golden
Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 85. The amounts in the preceding paragraph were determined using
the merger consideration of  $68.78 per share.

Executive Retention Agreements
Microsemi’s executive officers (who include Messrs. Peterson, Hohener, Pickle, Litchfield, Goren and

Goerner) are each party to an agreement (we refer to each agreement as a retention agreement), that provides for
certain severance benefits in the event the executive officer’s employment is terminated by Microsemi without
cause or by the executive officer for good reason (as such terms are defined in the executive officer’s retention
agreement) following a change in control of Microsemi (which we refer to as a qualifying termination). The
merger will constitute a change in control for purposes of the retention agreements. Each of the retention
agreements has a rolling two year term, unless either party gives notice of non-renewal, in which case the term
will be two years from the date of the non-renewal notice.

• a lump sum payment of two times the executive officer’s base salary;

• a lump sum payment of two times the executive officer’s highest annual incentive compensation paid
during any of the preceding three full fiscal years (in the case of Messrs. Peterson, Pickle and Hohener)
or two times the executive officer’s target annual incentive compensation for the year of termination (in
the case of Messrs. Litchfield, Goren and Goerner);

• a lump sum payment equal to two times the executive officer’s car allowance in effect at the time of
termination;

• full acceleration of the executive officer’s outstanding and unvested equity awards (other than
Mr. Peterson’s July 2016 equity award described below);

• continued payment by Microsemi of premiums (in the case of Messrs. Peterson, Pickle and Hohener),
or a lump sum payment equal to the expected costs (in the case of Messrs. Litchfield, Goren and
Goerner), for the executive officer’s medical, dental and vision benefits and life insurance for two years
following termination (in the case of Messrs. Peterson, Pickle and Hohener, subject to earlier
termination of such benefits if the executive officer is employed by another company during such
period);

• a lump sum payment of an amount equal to all unvested company contributions credited to the
executive officer’s Microsemi 401(k) plan account at the time of termination; and

• a lump sum payment of a pro rata amount of the executive’s base salary in effect on the date of
termination, for each day of vacation leave that is accrued but not yet paid.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The retention agreements provide that, in the event the executive officer’s employment is terminated in a
qualifying termination following a change in control, the executive officer will be entitled to:

All payments to the executive officers in connection with a qualifying termination are contingent upon the
executive officer’s execution of a general release agreement in favor of Microsemi and the executive officer’s
compliance with eighteen-month (in the case of Mr. Peterson), twelve-month (in the case of Mr. Pickle) or
twenty-four month (in the case of the other executive officers) post-termination non-competition (other than for
Mr. Peterson), non-disparagement and non-solicitation of employees covenants. The severance payments are
generally scheduled to be paid on the fifteenth day following termination, but in no event before the right to
revoke the release has lapsed (and if the period to revoke the release spans two calendar years, the payments will
be made in the second of the two calendar years). Furthermore, if the executive officer is a “specified employee”
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the severance payments will not be made until the earlier of
six months from the executive officer’s termination or the date of the executive officer’s death, to the extent such
a delay is required to avoid any tax, penalty or interest under Section 409A of the Code.

“Good reason” is defined under the Retention Agreements (as amended) to include, in general, the
occurrence of any of the following events: (i) any reduction in the compensation or benefits provided to the
executive officer, (ii) any change in the executive officer’s primary place of business to a location more than fifty
miles from Microsemi’s principal executive office, (iii) (for all executive officers, except Mr. Hohener) any
material reduction in the authorities, duties and responsibilities of the executive officer in effect as of
immediately prior to the change in control, (iv) any failure by Microsemi to obtain the assumption of the
Retention Agreement by any successor of Microsemi, (v) any material breach by Microsemi of the Retention
Agreement or (in the case of all executive officers except Mr. Hohener) any other agreement with the executive
officer, (vi) (for Mr. Hohener only) the assignment to Mr. Hohener of duties inconsistent with his position so as to
constitute a diminution of his status within Microsemi, including an assignment of Mr. Hohener to a position
other than Chief Financial Officer of the ultimate parent company in the event Microsemi is acquired by another
company, and (vii) (for Mr. Hohener) any action taken by the Board or a committee of the Board to effect any of
the events listed in the previous clauses.

The retention agreement for Mr. Peterson provides that if the payments and benefits provided to
Mr. Peterson under the retention agreement or otherwise would cause Mr. Peterson to be subject to an excise tax
for “excess parachute payments” under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code (or a similar state tax provision),
then Microsemi will pay Mr. Peterson an amount necessary to put him in the same after-tax

TABLE OF CONTENTS

position as if no excise tax had been imposed. In connection with the merger, Microsemi’s other executive
officers have entered into letter agreements with Microsemi that provide in the event any payments and benefits
provided to the executive officer under any Microsemi plan or agreement would cause the executive officer to be
subject to an excise tax for “excess parachute payments” under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, then such
payments and benefits will be reduced if and to the extent a reduction in payments or benefits would result in the
executive officer retaining a larger amount on an after-tax basis than if the executive officer received all the
payments and benefits.

For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would be payable to
Microsemi’s executive officers under their respective retention agreements upon a qualifying termination of the
executive officer’s employment in connection with the merger, see the section entitled “Non-Binding, Advisory
Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for Microsemi’s Named Executive Officers — Golden Parachute
Compensation” beginning on page 85.

Fiscal 2018 Executive Non-Equity Incentive Awards

Each of the executive officers was granted a cash incentive award opportunity under Microsemi’s Fiscal
2018 Executive Non-Equity Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the fiscal 2018 cash incentive plan), which
provides for the payment of cash bonuses based on Microsemi’s performance for fiscal 2018. The fiscal 2018
cash incentive plan provides that upon a change in control of Microsemi, such as the merger, during fiscal 2018,
the performance period will end on the last day of the fiscal quarter that ends in connection with or precedes the
change in control event and the executive officer will receive a cash bonus equal to the greater of the executive
officer’s target cash incentive amount (less the amount, if any, of any bonus paid or payable to the executive
officer based on the Company’s performance for the first two quarters of fiscal 2018) or the cash bonus that
would be earned based on Microsemi’s performance for the shortened performance period (including the offset
for any bonus paid or payable based on the Company’s performance for the first two quarters of fiscal 2018), as
determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board. Such cash bonus will be paid promptly, but in no
event more than one month, after the merger. The payments may be paid in Microsemi common stock. See the
section entitled “The Merger — Background of the Merger” beginning on page 29 for a more detailed discussion
on the background of the fiscal 2018 cash incentive plan.

For an estimate of the value of the fiscal 2018 cash incentive awards that will be payable to Microsemi’s
executive officers in connection with the merger, see the section entitled “Non-Binding, Advisory Vote on
Merger-Related Compensation for Microsemi’s Named Executive Officers — Golden Parachute Compensation”
beginning on page 85.

Additional Equity Awards

On March 30, 2018, Microsemi granted to each of the executive officers, other than Mr. Peterson, an RSU
award that vests over three years, with 40% of the total number of RSUs subject to the award scheduled to vest
on September 30, 2019 and 30% of the total number of RSUs subject to the award scheduled to vest on each of
September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2021 (which we refer to as the new RSU award). The new RSU awards
are the new Microsemi executive officer equity awards that are referenced in the section entitled “The Merger — 
Background of the Merger” beginning on page 29. The award agreements for the new RSU awards provide that if
the executive officer’s employment is terminated without cause or if the executive officer resigns for good reason
(as such terms are defined above in the discussion of the executive officers’ retention agreements, each a
“qualifying termination”), the executive officer’s new RSU award will fully vest at the time of such qualifying
termination. If a change in control of Microsemi does not occur by October 1, 2018, the award agreements for the
new RSU awards also provide that the Compensation Committee of the Board may, prior to the occurrence of
such a change in control, add performance-based vesting conditions to the new RSU awards.

Mr. Pickle was granted a new RSU award with respect to 39,647 shares of Microsemi common stock,
Mr. Hohener was granted a new RSU award with respect to 32,401 shares of Microsemi common stock,
Mr. Litchfield was granted a new RSU award with respect to 34,765 shares of Microsemi common stock,
Mr. Goren was granted a new RSU award with respect to 23,192 shares of Microsemi common stock, and
Mr. Goerner was granted a new RSU award with respect to 18,294 shares of Microsemi common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Microsemi’s executive officers in
connection with any acceleration of their Microsemi equity awards assuming a qualifying termination of the
executive officer’s employment occurs on March 30, 2018, see the section entitled “Non-Binding, Advisory Vote
on Merger-Related Compensation for Microsemi’s Named Executive Officers — Golden Parachute
Compensation” beginning on page 85.

Mr. Peterson’s July 2016 Equity Award

Mr. Peterson was granted a PSU award in July 2016 that vests if Microsemi’s common stock achieves
certain threshold closing prices for at least twenty consecutive trading days during a five year performance
period. The award previously vested as to the $50 and $60 per share vesting tranches under the award on
December 9, 2016 and March 14, 2018, respectively. The award agreement provides that the remaining PSUs
subject to the award, which cover a total of 250,000 shares of Microsemi common stock, will vest either (a) upon
a change in control of Microsemi, such as the merger, if the sale price per share in the change in control
transaction exceeds $70 per share, or (b) if the closing price of Microsemi’s common stock on Nasdaq equals or
exceeds $70 per share for each trading day in a period of not less than twenty consecutive trading days prior to
the effective time of the merger. Since the per share merger consideration does not exceed $70 per share, at the
effective time of the merger Mr. Peterson will forfeit the remaining 250,000 unvested PSUs subject to this award
unless, prior to that time, the closing price of Microsemi’s common stock on Nasdaq equals or exceeds $70 per
share for each trading day in a period of not less than twenty consecutive trading days.

Other Compensation Matters

Under the merger agreement, Microsemi may pay fiscal 2018 bonuses for the first half of fiscal 2018
(including to Microsemi’s executive officers pursuant to Microsemi’s fiscal 2018 cash incentive plan described
above) if the effective time of the merger has not occurred by the first day of the third fiscal quarter of fiscal
2018. In addition, if the effective time of the merger has not occurred by October 1, 2018, Microsemi may adopt
a fiscal 2019 annual incentive plan with terms similar to the fiscal 2018 cash incentive plan described above and
may pay bonuses for the full 2018 fiscal year under the fiscal 2018 cash incentive plan. To the extent any
performance period under a Microsemi bonus plan is deemed to end on or in connection with the effective time of
the merger, the Compensation Committee or other applicable administrator will, prior to the effective time of the
merger, determine the bonus payable pursuant to the terms of the applicable plan or in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practice. Microsemi may settle bonus, commission and other incentive payments in
Microsemi common stock.

Under the merger agreement, if the effective time of the merger has not occurred by October 1, 2018,
Microsemi may grant restricted stock, restricted stock unit and/or performance stock unit awards for its fiscal
2019 year to employees, including executive officers. Microsemi may also make ordinary course increases to the
annual salaries of employees, including executive officers, consistent with past practice.

Under the merger agreement, Microsemi may also pay compensation, including the granting of restricted
stock and/or restricted stock unit awards, to Microsemi’s non-employee directors in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practice.

Indemnification and Insurance

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Microsemi’s directors and officers will be entitled to certain
ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies. See the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement — Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance” beginning on page
82 for a description of such ongoing indemnification and coverage obligations.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S.
holders (as defined below) whose shares of our common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the
merger. This summary does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be
relevant to our stockholders. For purposes of this discussion, we use the term “U.S. holder” to mean a beneficial
owner of shares of our common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
• a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or

organized under the laws of the United States or any of its political subdivisions;
• a trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and of which one

or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions or (ii) has a valid election in
effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or

• an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) holds our common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on
the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. A partner of a partnership holding our common
stock should consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.

This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the Code),
Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code and published rulings of the Internal Revenue Service and
court decisions, all as of the date hereof. These laws are subject to change or differing interpretation, possibly on
a retroactive basis, which could affect the treatment described below. In addition, we have not sought, and do not
intend to seek, any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the IRS) with respect to the
statements made and the conclusions reached in the following discussion, and no assurance can be given that the
IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the
event of litigation. The discussion applies only to U.S. holders who hold shares of our common stock as capital
assets, and does not apply to holders of shares of our common stock received in connection with the exercise of
employee stock options or otherwise as compensation, holders who hold an equity interest, actually or
constructively, in Microchip or Microsemi after the merger, holders who have perfected and not withdrawn a
demand for, or lost the right to, appraisal under the DGCL or to holders who may be subject to special rules under
the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as insurance companies, banks, tax-exempt organizations, financial
institutions, broker-dealers, partnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities (or investors therein),
mutual funds, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, stockholders subject to
the alternative minimum tax, stockholders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar or
stockholders who hold our common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, wash sale, constructive sale or conversion
transaction). This discussion also does not address the U.S. tax consequences of the receipt of cash in connection
with the treatment of stock-based awards or any other matters relating to equity compensation or benefit plans or
any aspect of state, local or foreign tax laws. This discussion does not address any consequences under the U.S.
federal tax laws other than those pertaining to the income tax, does not discuss the unearned income Medicare
contribution tax on “net investment income” imposed pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation
Act of 2010 and does not address any consequences under any applicate state, local or foreign tax laws. Holders
of our common stock should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them
of the merger, including the applicability and effect of any state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

Exchange of Shares of Our Common Stock for Cash Pursuant to the Merger Agreement
The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.

federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder whose shares of our common stock are converted into the
right to receive cash in the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal
to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares (determined before the
deduction of any applicable withholding taxes, as described below under “Backup Withholding and Information
Reporting”) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis will
generally equal the price the U.S. holder paid for its shares. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each
block of shares of our common stock held by a U.S. holder (i.e., shares of our common stock acquired at the same
cost in a single transaction). Any such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss where the U.S.
holder’s holding period for such shares of our common stock is more than one year at the effective time of the
merger. Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. holder is generally taxed at preferential rates. There are
limitations on the deductibility of capital losses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

A U.S. holder may be subject to information reporting with respect to any payments made pursuant to the
merger. In addition, backup withholding of tax will apply at the statutory rate to such payments, unless the U.S.
holder or other applicable payee provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies that such number is correct
and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules or otherwise establishes an exemption. Each U.S.
holder should complete and sign, under penalty of perjury, the Form W-9 to be included as part of the letter of
transmittal and return it to the payment agent, in order to provide the information and certification necessary to
avoid backup withholding, unless an exemption applies and is established in a manner satisfactory to the payment
agent.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from cash payments to a U.S. holder
pursuant to the merger under the backup withholding rules will generally be allowable as a refund or a credit
against such U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished
to the Internal Revenue Service. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to qualifications for
exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining the exemption.

The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above are not intended to constitute a complete
description of all tax consequences relating to the merger. Because individual circumstances may differ,
each stockholder should consult the stockholder’s tax advisor regarding the applicability of the rules
discussed above to the stockholder and the particular tax effects to the stockholder of the merger in light of
such stockholder’s particular circumstances, the application of state, local and foreign tax laws, and, if
applicable, the treatment of stock-based awards or any other matters relating to equity compensation or
benefit plans.

Regulatory Approvals

Completion of the merger is subject to the U.S. and foreign antitrust clearances listed below. Although
Microsemi and Microchip believe that they will be able to obtain these clearances in a timely manner, there can
be no assurances that they will obtain these clearances in a timely manner or at all. The governmental agencies
listed below that have jurisdiction over the merger have broad discretion in making their decisions as to whether
to grant clearances and as to the conditions that such clearances will be subject to. Recent statements and actions
of the United States government, including the decision to prohibit Broadcom Ltd.’s acquisition of Qualcomm
Inc., have raised concerns that the governments of other countries will act in an increasingly protectionist manner,
including with respect to antitrust clearances. For example, various media outlets have reported that a senior
official of the Anti-Monopoly Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce of China (which we refer to as MOFCOM)
has recently stated that China will seriously evaluate the effects of protectionist practices by the United States and
the European Union and take relevant measures if necessary to defend the interests of domestic Chinese
enterprises. If Microsemi and Microchip are not able to obtain the regulatory approvals required to complete the
merger, the merger will not be completed.

Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act

The merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act and the related rules and regulations, which
provide that certain transactions may not be completed until required information has been furnished to the
Department of Justice (which we refer to as the DOJ), and the FTC and until certain waiting periods have been
terminated or have expired. The HSR Act requires Microchip and Microsemi to observe a 30-day waiting period
after the submission of their HSR filings before consummating the merger, unless the waiting period is
terminated early. On March 13, 2018, each of Microchip and Microsemi filed a Notification and Report Form
under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC, which filings started the initial 30-day waiting period required by
the HSR Act. The 30-day waiting period expired at 8:59 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time on April 12, 2018.

Other Regulatory Approvals

The merger is also subject to antitrust review by governmental authorities in several foreign jurisdictions in
which Microchip and Microsemi have sufficient revenues to require filings. Microchip and Microsemi have
submitted filings in Austria, Germany, China, the Philippines and Taiwan and will submit a filing in Japan as
promptly as is reasonably practicable.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Austria
Based on the businesses in which Microchip and Microsemi are engaged, a merger notification was made

with the Federal Competition Authority (which we refer to as the FCA) on April 13, 2018. Under the Austrian
Cartel Act, the merger may not be consummated until formal clearance has been granted by the FCA. The initial
review period is four weeks from filing of the notification (Phase I), which may be extended to six weeks at the
request of the notifying party. If the FCA or the Federal Cartel Prosecutor requests an in-depth (Phase II) review
before the Cartel Court, the review period must be completed within an additional five months (extendable to
six months at the request of the notifying party).

Germany
Based on the businesses in which Microchip and Microsemi are engaged, a merger notification was filed

with the Federal Cartel Office (which we refer to as FCO) on April 13, 2018. Under the Act against Restraints of
Competition, the merger may not be consummated until either formal clearance has been granted by the FCO or
the relevant waiting period has expired. The initial review period (Phase I) is one month from filing of the
notification. The review period may be extended by the longer of  (i) four months, or (ii) one month from the date
of receipt by the FCO of all of the additionally requested information in the event of an in-depth investigation
(Phase II).

China
Based on the businesses in which Microchip and Microsemi are engaged, a merger notification was made to

MOFCOM on March 27, 2018. Under the Anti-Monopoly Law, the merger may not be consummated until (a) a
clearance decision is received from MOFCOM or (b) a 30 calendar day review period following formal
acceptance of a notification concerning the merger agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby,
(Phase I) expires without a decision from MOFCOM (in practice, MOFCOM does not let mergers through by
way of such an ‘implied approval’ but either clears the deal or moves to the next review stage). The Phase I
review period may be extended by an additional 90 calendar days (Phase II) and by a further 60 calendar days in
the event of an in-depth investigation (Phase III).

Japan
Based on the businesses in which Microchip and Microsemi are engaged, the merger requires a share

acquisition filing and a merger filing with the Japan Fair Trade Commission (which we refer to as the JFTC),
pursuant to the Act on Prohibition of Private Monopolization and Maintenance of Fair Trade (Act No.54 of
April 14, 1947) (which we refer to as the AMA). Under the AMA, the merger may not be consummated until the
expiration of a 30 calendar day review period following receipt of the completed filings for the two notifications
concerning the share acquisition and the merger agreement as well as the transactions contemplated thereby
(Phase I). The review period may be extended if before the expiry of the 30 calendar day review period, the JFTC
requests additional information from Microchip and/or Microsemi in the event of an in-depth investigation
(Phase II). Requesting additional information extends the review period by the longer of either (i) 120 calendar
days from the date of acceptance of the initial notification, or (ii) 90 calendar days from the date of acceptance by
the JFTC of all of the additionally requested information.

Philippines
Based on the businesses in which Microchip and Microsemi are engaged, a merger notification was made to

the Philippine Competition Commission (which we refer to as the PCC) on March 27, 2018. Under the PCC
Rules on Merger Procedure, the PCC will determine whether a filing is complete within 15 calendar days of the
filing. The merger may not be consummated until the expiration of a 30 calendar day review period following the
completed filing of a notification concerning the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
(Phase I). The review period may be extended for an additional 60 calendar days starting on the day after service
of a Phase II notice accompanied by a request for additional information (Phase II).

the Taiwan Fair Trade Act, the merger may not be consummated until the expiration of a 30 working day review
period following the acceptance of a completed filing of a notification concerning the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby. The review period may be extended for an additional 60 working days at the
TFTC’s discretion.

In addition, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust
laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the
completion of the merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek
to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. Although neither Microsemi nor
Microchip believes that the merger will violate the antitrust laws, there can be no assurance that a challenge to the
merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

This section describes the material terms of the merger agreement. The description of the merger agreement
in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of
the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the
merger agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its
entirety.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

The merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A, and this summary of its terms are included
in this proxy statement to provide you with information regarding its terms. Factual disclosures about Microsemi
contained in this proxy statement or in Microsemi’s public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or
modify the factual disclosures about Microsemi contained in the merger agreement. The representations,
warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by Microsemi, Microchip and Merger Sub were made
solely to the parties to, and solely for the purposes of, the merger agreement and as of specific dates and were
qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by Microsemi, Microchip and Merger Sub in connection
with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and
warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that
the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances
in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if the representations
and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating
risk between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations
and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally
applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by
matters set forth on the disclosure schedule delivered to Microchip in connection with the merger agreement
(which we refer to as the disclosure schedule), which disclosures are not reflected in the merger agreement.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed
since the date of the merger agreement. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants
or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts of Microsemi, Microchip, Merger Sub or
any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.

Effects of the Merger; Directors and Officers; Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws

The merger agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Microsemi upon the terms, and
subject to the conditions, set forth in the merger agreement. As a result of the merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will cease and Microsemi will continue as the surviving corporation.

The directors and officers of Merger Sub at the effective time of the merger will, from and after the effective
time of the merger, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the surviving corporation, in each case, until
their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified.

At the effective time of the merger, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of Microsemi will
be amended and restated to read as set forth in Exhibit A to the merger agreement, until thereafter amended as
provided therein or as provided by applicable law, and the by-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger will be the by-laws of the surviving corporation, until thereafter amended as
provided therein or as provided by applicable law.

Following the completion of the merger, our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq, will be
deregistered under the Exchange Act and will cease to be publicly traded.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

The merger agreement provides that the closing of the merger (which we refer to as the closing), will take
place on the second business day following the date on which the last of the conditions to closing (described in
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Merger” beginning on

page 78) has been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions on the closing date of the
merger), or such other time and date as may be mutually agreed in writing by Microsemi and Microchip.
However, if the marketing period (as summarized below) has not ended on such date, the closing will instead take
place (a) on the date following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the earliest to occur of  (i) a
business day during the marketing period specified by Microchip on no less than three business days’ prior
written notice to Microsemi and (ii) two business days after the final day of the marketing period (subject, in each
case, to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing (other than the conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions on the
closing date of the merger)), or (b) at such other time and date as may be mutually agreed to in writing by
Microchip, Merger Sub and Microsemi.

Assuming receipt of required regulatory approvals and timely satisfaction of other closing conditions,
including the approval by our stockholders of the merger proposal, we currently expect the closing of the merger
to occur in June 2018.

The effective time of the merger will occur upon a certificate of merger having been duly filed with and
accepted by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as Microsemi and Microchip
may agree in writing and is specified in the certificate of merger).

The marketing period is the first period of 20 consecutive business days after the date of the merger
agreement (i) commencing on the date after the date on which Microchip and its debt financing sources have
received certain financial statements, pro forma financial statements, and other financial data and financial
information relating to Microsemi and its subsidiaries, in each case reasonably requested by Microchip in
connection with the offering or arrangement of financing, which information we refer to as the “required financial
information,” and (ii)(x) throughout which period, with respect to the required financial information, Microsemi’s
independent auditors shall not have withdrawn any audit opinion with respect to any audited financial statements
contained in the required financial information (unless a new unqualified audit opinion has been received in
respect thereof from such auditors or another nationally recognized independent registered accounting firm of
national standing), such financial statements are sufficiently current on any day during such 20 consecutive
business day period to permit a registration statement using financial statements to be declared effective by the
SEC on any day during the marketing period and meets certain other requirements, and (y) at the end of which,
certain conditions to the closing of the merger have been satisfied (the conditions to the closing of the merger are
described under “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Merger” beginning on page 78). The marketing
period will (i) end on or prior to August 17, 2018 or commence on or after September 4, 2018, (ii) end on or prior
to November 21, 2018 or commence on or after November 27, 2018 and (iii) end on or prior to December 20,
2018 or commence on or after January 2, 2019. In addition, the marketing period will end on any earlier date that
is the date on which the debt financing of Microchip is consummated.

Treatment of Common Stock, Stock-Based Awards and Performance Awards

Each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other
than excluded shares and dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive $68.78 in cash from
Microchip, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes.

At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi stock option and stock appreciation right (or portion
thereof) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (whether vested or unvested) will be
assumed by Microchip and converted into a Microchip option or stock appreciation right with respect to a
number of shares of Microchip common stock equal to the product of  (i) the number of shares of Microsemi
common stock subject to the Microsemi stock option or stock appreciation right immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger and (ii) the equity award exchange ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share).
The exercise or base price per share of each assumed option or stock appreciation right will equal the exercise or
base price per share of Microsemi common stock under such award immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger divided by the equity award exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Each assumed option
or stock appreciation right will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to the
award immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, including the same vesting schedule and any
applicable accelerated vesting

provisions. The “equity award exchange ratio” is the quotient obtained by dividing $68.78 by the average closing
price for a share of Microchip common stock (rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent as reported on Nasdaq)
for the ten most recent days ending on the last trading day immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi RSU award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, to the extent unvested (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting in
connection with the merger pursuant to the terms of the award), will be assumed by Microchip and converted into
a Microchip RSU, with the number of shares of Microchip common stock subject to assumed RSUs equal to the
product of  (i) the number of shares of Microsemi common stock subject to the unvested Microsemi RSU award
as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and (ii) the equity award exchange ratio (rounded
down to the nearest whole share). Each assumed RSU will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
that were applicable to such award immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi RSU award that is outstanding and unsettled
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and that is vested or will vest in connection with the merger
pursuant to the terms of the award will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (without interest and
less applicable withholding taxes) an amount in cash equal to the number of shares subject to the vested RSU
award multiplied by $68.78.

At the effective time of the merger, each Microsemi PSU award outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be vested immediately prior to the effective time of the merger as to
a percentage of the total number of shares of Microsemi common stock subject to the award as determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board (which percentage will in no event be less than 100% of the target
number of shares subject to the award or greater than the maximum possible vesting percentage under the terms
of the award). Each such vested Microsemi PSU will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (without
interest and less applicable withholding taxes) an amount in cash equal to the number of vested PSUs (after
giving effect to the foregoing determination by the Compensation Committee) multiplied by $68.78.

At the effective time of the merger, each share of Microsemi Restricted Stock will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $68.78 (less applicable withholding taxes), which
will be subject to the same vesting requirements and other terms and conditions that were applicable to such
Restricted Stock award immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (including any vesting or
acceleration provisions provided with respect to the award). The cash amount will be paid on or reasonably
promptly after the applicable vesting date.

Microsemi and Microchip may, prior to the effective time of the merger, agree that any outstanding stock
option, stock appreciation right, RSU, PSU or Restricted Stock award that is subject to the laws of a non-U.S.
jurisdiction be treated in a manner other than as set forth above, to the extent that Microsemi and Microchip
reasonably and in good faith determine that (A) the manner in which such award would otherwise be treated
would result in a violation of applicable laws or a materially adverse tax consequence to the individual holding
such award in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction, (B) such different treatment is necessary to comply with such
applicable laws and (C) such different treatment is, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with the
applicable provisions of the merger agreement.

Surrender and Payment Procedures

Immediately following the effective time of the merger, Microchip will deposit, or will cause to be
deposited, with the payment agent a cash amount in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate merger
consideration, other than in respect of the excluded shares as discussed below, payable to our stockholders and, to
the extent not previously deposited by Microsemi with another financial institution, the consideration payable to
our equity-based and performance-based award holders as a result of the merger.

Promptly after the effective time of the merger, and in any event within five business days thereafter,
Microchip and the surviving corporation will cause the payment agent to mail (i) to each of our stockholders of
record immediately prior to the effective time of the merger who hold certificated shares of our common stock
(other than holders of excluded shares and dissenting shares) (A) a letter of transmittal

• our and our subsidiaries’ due organization, existence, good standing and authority to carry on our and
their businesses;

• our capitalization, including:

• the number of authorized and outstanding shares and the number of Microsemi equity awards
outstanding;

specifying that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon the delivery of the
certificates representing shares of our common stock (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates as provided
in the merger agreement) to the payment agent, and (B) instructions advising each such holder of record how to
surrender his, her or its shares of our common stock in exchange for the merger consideration, and (ii) to each of
our stockholders of record immediately prior to the effective time of the merger who hold uncertificated shares of
our common stock (other than holders of excluded shares and dissenting shares), a notice that the merger has
become effective. The payment agent will pay each holder of record the aggregate merger consideration to which
such holder is entitled (i) in the case of certificated shares, after delivery or transfer of such shares by holders of
certificated shares and (ii) in the case of uncertificated shares, without any action on the part of the person in
whose name such uncertificated shares are registered. Interest will not be paid or accrue in respect of the merger
consideration. From the effective time until the surrender or transfer of certificates or book-entry shares, as the
case may be, each such certificate or book-entry share will represent only the right to receive in exchange
therefor a cash amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) equal to the merger consideration.

In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares that is not registered in the transfer records of Microsemi, a
cash amount equal to the merger consideration may be paid to such transferee upon due surrender to the payment
agent of the certificates formerly representing such shares, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to
evidence and effect such transfer, and evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar taxes have been
paid or are not applicable.

Any holder of uncertificated shares will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the payment agent to receive the merger consideration that such holder is entitled to receive.
Microchip will cause the payment agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
effective time of the merger, the merger consideration in respect of such uncertificated shares (and such
uncertificated shares will be cancelled).

From and after the effective time of the merger, there will be no further transfers of shares of our common
stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

If any cash deposited with the payment agent remains unclaimed for one year following the effective time of
the merger, such cash will be delivered to Microchip. Thereafter, holders of our common stock (other than
holders of excluded shares) who have not received payment due to non-compliance with the exchange procedures
will be entitled to look only to Microchip with respect to payment of the merger consideration (after giving effect
to any required tax withholdings), without any interest thereon.

Microchip, Microsemi, Merger Sub, the surviving corporation and the payment agent will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the merger consideration such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. Any sum
that is withheld will be remitted to the appropriate taxing authority, and will be treated for all purposes of the
merger agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares with regard to whom it is deducted and withheld.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation Changes

No Solicitation or Negotiation

Except as permitted by the terms of the merger agreement described below, we have agreed in the merger
agreement that neither Microsemi nor any of its subsidiaries will, and Microsemi will instruct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its or its subsidiaries’ directors, officers, employees, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants, consultants, agents and other advisors or representatives (which we refer to as representatives) to,
directly or indirectly:

The merger agreement defines the term “acquisition proposal” to mean any offer, proposal or indication of
interest from any third party relating to (i) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, joint
venture or other similar transaction involving Microsemi or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to which the
stockholders of Microsemi immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 80% of the equity interests in
the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction, (ii) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of
business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition or disposition of
20% or more of the assets of Microsemi or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) any dissolution, liquidation,
recapitalization or other significant corporate reorganization of Microsemi or any of its subsidiaries with assets
which, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of Microsemi or to
which 20% or more of the consolidated revenues or earnings of Microsemi are attributable, (iv) any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase by any person or group resulting in, or proposal or offer, which if consummated
would result in, any person or group becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of
related transactions, of 20% or more of any class of outstanding voting or equity securities of Microsemi or any
of its subsidiaries or (v) any combination of the foregoing, in each case, other than the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement.

We agreed to, and agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to cause our representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third party
conducted with respect to an acquisition proposal. We also agreed to promptly request in writing that any third
party that has executed a confidentiality agreement since the date which is one year prior to the date of the merger
agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring Microsemi or any material portion thereof return all
confidential information furnished to such third party by or on behalf of Microsemi, and Microsemi will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to have such information returned or destroyed (to the extent destruction of such
information is permitted by such confidentiality agreement).

Under certain circumstances a breach of the provision described above by Microsemi’s representative will
be deemed to be a breach of Microsemi.

No Solicitation or Negotiation Exceptions

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Microsemi and Microchip also agreed that, at any time prior to the time
Microsemi’s stockholders adopt the merger agreement, the Board may, directly or indirectly through any
representative, with respect to a third party that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide written acquisition
proposal after the date of the merger agreement that did not result from a breach of the

• such confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill” or similar provision that would
prohibit such third party from making any acquisition proposal;

• such confidentiality agreement will be provided to Microchip for information purposes immediately
following the execution and delivery thereof; and

• Microsemi will (a) solely with respect to the initial contact with respect to any third party, promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours of its receipt) advise Microchip orally and in writing of its receipt of
any acquisition proposal, including the terms and conditions thereof, and the identity of the person or
group making, such acquisition proposal, request or inquiry (and if such acquisition proposal is in
written form, Microsemi will give Microchip a copy thereof) and provide notice of Microsemi’s
intention to engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non-public information
to, such third party, and (b) contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information to such
person, furnish such non-public information to Microchip (to the extent not previously furnished or
made available by Microsemi to Microchip or any of its representatives);

non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement, engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with
any third party and its representatives or furnish to such third party and its representatives any information
(including non-public information) relating to Microsemi or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement on terms not less favorable to Microsemi than those contained in the confidentiality agreement, dated
as of November 20, 2017, between Microsemi and Microchip, and containing additional provisions that expressly
permit Microsemi to comply with the terms of the non-solicitation provisions in the merger agreement; provided,
that:

if and only to the extent that the Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal (as defined below)
or would be reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal.

The merger agreement defines the term “superior proposal” to mean a bona fide written acquisition proposal
that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions in the merger agreement and that would result
in any third party or group becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the assets
(on a consolidated basis) of Microsemi and its subsidiaries or more than 50% of any class of equity securities of
Microsemi that the Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such acquisition
proposal, the likelihood of the proposal being consummated in accordance with its terms and all other matters
that the Board considers appropriate), would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to
Microsemi’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by Microchip
pursuant to these provisions).

Microsemi agrees to promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Microchip orally and in writing of
its receipt of any acquisition proposal, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person or
group making, such acquisition proposal, request or inquiry, and to keep Microchip informed of the status and
material terms and conditions (including all material amendments) of any such acquisition proposal, request or
inquiry and, promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four hours thereafter) upon receipt of any written
material amendment or written proposed amendment of any such acquisition proposal, Microsemi will give
Microchip a copy thereof.

Change of Recommendation

The merger agreement provides that (subject to certain exceptions described below) neither the Board, nor
any committee thereof, will (i) withdraw, amend or modify (in a manner adverse to Microchip or Merger Sub) the
Board’s recommendation that Microsemi’s stockholders adopt the merger agreement in accordance with
applicable law, which recommendation we refer to as a Board recommendation, (ii) publicly endorse, adopt or
recommend any acquisition proposal or superior proposal, (iii) in the case of any publicly announced acquisition
proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer, fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or
exchange offer for our common stock that constitutes an

• Microsemi notifies Microchip in writing at least four business days in advance (which we refer to as, as
may be extended, the notice period) that it intends to effect a change of recommendation in connection
with a superior proposal or to terminate the merger agreement with respect to a superior proposal,
which notice will specify the identity of the party who made such superior proposal and all of the
material terms and conditions of such superior proposal and include copies of any proposed transaction
documents; and

• during the notice period, Microsemi causes its financial and legal advisors to negotiate in good faith
with Microchip during such four-business day period (to the extent that Microchip desires to negotiate)
to enable Microchip to propose in writing such revisions to the terms of the merger agreement as would
permit the Board not to effect a change of recommendation in connection with a superior proposal or to
terminate the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal; and the Board will have considered
in good faith any changes to the merger agreement proposed in writing by Microchip and will have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its outside financial
advisors, that the acquisition proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal even if such changes
proposed in writing by Microchip were to be given effect.

acquisition proposal within 10 business days after the commencement of such offer; or (iv) pass a resolution to
approve or publicly propose to take any of the foregoing actions (any action or omission described in (i) through
(iv), we refer to as a change of recommendation).

Change of Recommendation Exceptions
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Microsemi and Microchip also agreed that, prior to the time the stockholders

of Microsemi adopt the merger agreement, the Board may make a change of recommendation and terminate the
merger agreement with respect to a superior proposal (as described in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement — Termination” starting on page 80), if and only if  (x)(1) the Board has received a bona fide written
acquisition proposal that did not result from a breach (or deemed breach) of the non-solicitation provisions in the
merger agreement and that constitutes a superior proposal, (2) the Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect such change of recommendation would
reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders of Microsemi under Delaware
law, (3) prior to effecting such a change of recommendation, Microsemi will have provided Microchip with at
least four business days’ notice of its intention to take such action and which notice will include the most current
version of the proposed definitive agreement and, to the extent not included therein, a written description of the
material terms and conditions and identity of the third party making such superior proposal and (4) Microchip
will not have made within the four business day period a written offer or proposal capable of acceptance that the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel is at least as
favorable, from a financial point of view, to Microsemi stockholders, or (y)(1) a fact, event, change, development
or set of circumstances occurs or exists after the date of the merger agreement that materially effects the business,
operations, financial condition or results of operations of Microsemi or any of its subsidiaries, which is not
related to either an acquisition proposal or any fluctuation in the market price or trading volume of our common
stock in and of itself, that was neither known to the Board nor reasonably foreseeable to the Board as of or prior
to the date of the merger agreement, (2) the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that the failure to effect such a change in recommendation would be reasonably likely to constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders of Microsemi under Delaware laws, (3) Microsemi has provided
Microchip with at least four business days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a written
description of the Board’s basis and rationale for proposing to effect such a change in recommendation, and
(4) Microchip has not made within the four business day period a written offer or proposal capable of acceptance
that the Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel would obviate the need
for the Board to effect such a change of recommendation.

Match Rights
Microsemi further agreed that the Board will not make a change of recommendation in response to an

acquisition proposal (or terminate the merger agreement with respect to a superior proposal, in which case
Microsemi will be required to pay a termination fee of  $290,000,000 to Microchip), unless:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Stockholders Meeting

Microsemi has agreed, in accordance with its organizational documents and applicable law, to cause a
meeting of its stockholders to be duly called and held as promptly as practicable after the date of the merger
agreement (and in no event later than forty days after the commencement of the mailing of this proxy statement
to our stockholders) for the purpose of obtaining the approval of the merger and adoption of the merger
agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Microsemi
common stock entitled to vote on the merger proposal and to comply with all legal requirements applicable to
such meeting. Microsemi has agreed that the Board will recommend adoption of the merger agreement to
Microsemi’s stockholders, subject to the provisions of the merger agreement discussed above under “The Merger
Agreement — No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation Changes” beginning on page
73.

Filings; Other Actions; Notification

Microsemi, Microchip and Merger Sub will use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties to
the merger agreement in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the merger, including using reasonable best efforts to:

As soon as reasonably practicable, each of Microchip and Microsemi is required to file with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division a notification and report form relating to the merger agreement and the merger as required by
the HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any foreign
governmental entity that may be required by the antitrust laws of any applicable foreign jurisdiction as soon as
reasonable practicable (including as described more particularly in the section entitled “The Merger — 
Regulatory Approvals” beginning on page 61).

Each of Microchip and Microsemi are also required to cooperate and coordinate with the other in making the
filings described above, supply the other with any information that may be required or requested by the
applicable competition or merger control authorities and supply any additional information that may be required
or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any applicable jurisdiction.

Microchip and Merger Sub are required to use reasonable best efforts to obtain any clearance or approval
from any governmental entity or to prevent the initiation of any lawsuit by any governmental entity under any
antitrust or competition law or to prevent the entry of any decree, judgment, injunction, preliminary or
permanent, or any order that would otherwise make the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
unlawful. Notwithstanding the forgoing, neither Microchip nor Merger Sub will be under any obligation to make
proposals, execute or carry out agreements, enter into consent decrees or submit to orders providing for (A) the
sale, divestiture, license or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Microchip or any of its affiliates or Microsemi or any of its
subsidiaries, (B) the imposition of any limitation or regulation on the ability of Microchip or any of its affiliates

• such requested cooperation will not, in the good faith determination of Microsemi, unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of its business or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of Microsemi or any of its subsidiaries;

• nothing will require Microsemi or any of its subsidiaries to (i) provide any information the disclosure
of which is prohibited or restricted under applicable law or is legally privileged, (ii) waive or amend
any terms of the merger agreement, or (iii) take any action that will conflict with its organizational
documents or any applicable laws or would result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any
agreement to which Microsemi or any of its subsidiaries is a party;

• neither Microsemi nor any of its subsidiaries will be required to pay any fees or reimburse any
expenses prior to the closing date of the merger for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is
not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Microchip or any of its subsidiaries; and

• neither Microsemi nor any of its subsidiaries will be required, prior to the closing of the merger, to give
any indemnities that would be effective prior to the closing date of the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

in the case of clauses (A), (B) or (C) above, such sale, divestiture, license, disposition, holding separate,
limitation or regulation applicable to Microsemi would have or would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect (as defined above) or a material adverse effect on the business, operations, financial condition or
results of operations of Microchip and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Microchip has agreed to not knowingly take any action (including the acquisition by it or its affiliates of any
interest in any person that derives revenues from products, services or lines of business that compete with
Microsemi’s products, services or lines of business) if such action would make it materially more likely that there
would arise any impediments under any antitrust law with respect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

Financing

Prior to the closing of the merger, Microsemi has agreed that it and its subsidiaries will, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested
by Microchip or any of its subsidiaries in connection with any debt financing or any other debt or capital markets
financing of Microchip or any of its subsidiaries for the purpose of financing the merger and any transactions
related to the merger; provided, that:

No pre-closing director of Microsemi or any of its subsidiaries will be required to take any action to approve
any debt financing of Microchip or any of its subsidiaries, and neither Microsemi nor any of its subsidiaries will
be obligated to take any action that requires action or approval by any pre-closing director of Microsemi or any of
its subsidiaries prior to the closing of such debt financing.

Treatment of Outstanding Debt

Microsemi has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to commence, upon Microchip’s written request, a
tender offer for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Microsemi’s 9.125% senior notes due 2023
(which we refer to as the senior notes), issued pursuant to the indenture, dated January 15, 2016, among
Microsemi, certain of its subsidiaries party thereto as guarantors, and U.S. Bank National Association (which we
refer to as the senior notes indenture), and to provide any other cooperation reasonably requested by Microchip to
facilitate the covenant defeasance or discharge of the senior notes, if elected by Microchip, effective as of the
closing.

Additionally, Microsemi will use its reasonable best efforts to issue, upon Microchip’s written request, a
notice of optional redemption for a redemption date no earlier than the closing date for all of the senior notes.

In addition, on the closing date all obligations then outstanding under the credit agreement, dated
January 15, 2016, among Microsemi, the lenders party thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (which
we refer to as the credit agreement), will be repaid in full and Microsemi will use reasonable best efforts to cause
the release on the closing date of all liens securing obligations under the credit agreement.

Employee Benefits Matters

Microchip has agreed that employees of Microsemi and any subsidiary of Microsemi who continue to be
employed in the United States after the effective time of the merger (which we refer to collectively as the
continuing employees), will:

Additionally, from and after the effective time of the merger, Microchip has agreed to use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) take into account such continuing employee’s employment with Microsemi or any of its subsidiaries
(including their predecessors) for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits, and benefit accrual (except for
benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, unless required by applicable law), as if such service were
with Microchip, to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of Microsemi or its
subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits), (ii) cause any pre-existing condition and eligibility limitations under health or welfare benefit plans of
Microchip or its subsidiaries to be waived with respect to the continuing employees to the extent waived or
satisfied under the Microsemi benefit plans the continuing employee participated in prior to the effective time of
the merger, and (iii) give each continuing employee credit for eligible expenses for deductible, co-payments and
out-of-pocket expenses paid under the Microsemi benefit plans the continuing employee participated in prior to

agreements set forth in the merger agreement; or

Termination Fee

In certain circumstances, Microsemi may be required to pay Microchip the termination fee of $290,000,000
if the merger agreement is terminated.

The termination fee would be payable if all of the following occur:

• within 12 months following the date of such termination, Microsemi or any of its subsidiaries
consummates a transaction contemplated by an acquisition proposal or enters into a definitive
agreement providing for an acquisition transaction (in each case, the references to “20%” and “80%” in
the definition of  “acquisition proposal” being deemed to be references to “50%”); in which case we
must pay Microchip the termination fee (less the amount of Microchip expenses previously paid to
Microchip pursuant to the merger agreement) within three business days after demand by Microchip.

• if Microchip terminates the merger agreement because of a triggering event, in which case we must pay
Microchip the termination fee within two business days after demand by Microchip; or

• if prior to obtaining the stockholder approval, Microsemi terminates the merger agreement in order to
enter into an alternative acquisition agreement providing for a superior proposal, in which case
Microsemi must pay Microchip the termination fee concurrently with and as a condition to the
effectiveness of the termination of the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The termination fee would also be payable in the following circumstances:

Expenses

Except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense; provided, that costs incurred in
connection with the filing and printing of the proxy statement will be equally shared by Microchip and
Microsemi.

In addition, Microsemi will be required to pay Microchip a reimbursement fee of up to $35,000,000 for
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Microchip and its affiliates (which we
refer to as Microchip expenses), if either Microchip or Microsemi terminates the merger agreement for failure to
consummate the merger for failure to obtain the stockholder approval under circumstances in which no
acquisition proposal has been announced or otherwise become known to Microsemi.

Remedies

No termination of the merger agreement will relieve any party to the merger agreement of any liability or
damages to the other party resulting from any fraud or a knowing and willful material breach of its obligations set
forth in the merger agreement.

Except in the event of fraud or a knowing and willful material breach, the parties have agreed that if the
merger agreement is terminated and a termination fee becomes due and payable and is paid by us, the termination
fee will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Microchip and its subsidiaries against us and our subsidiaries for any
loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in the merger agreement or the failure of the
merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to be consummated. In no event will we
be required to pay the termination fee on more than one occasion.

Each party is entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the merger agreement and to obtain
an injunction restraining any breach or violation or threatened breach or violation of the provisions of the merger
agreement. There is no necessity to post a bond or other form of security with or as a condition to obtaining such
injunction or injunctions.

Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance

For six years after the effective time of the merger, Microchip will cause the surviving corporation and its
subsidiaries to honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of Microsemi and its subsidiaries under their
respective organizational documents and all agreements for indemnification, exculpation of liability or
advancement of expenses, in effect as of the date of the merger agreement between Microsemi or any of its
subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors, officers, employees and agents or any person
who becomes a director, officer, employee or agent prior to the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as
the indemnified parties).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For six years after the effective time of the merger, Microchip will cause the organizational documents of the
surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of
Microsemi and its subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the organizational documents of Microsemi and its
subsidiaries.

For a period of six years after the effective time of the merger, Microchip and the surviving corporation will
maintain in effect Microsemi’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (which we refer to as D&O
insurance), in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger, covering each
person covered by the D&O insurance immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, on terms with
respect to the coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of the D&O insurance in effect on the date of
the merger agreement; provided, however, that the surviving corporation may, at its option, substitute therefor
policies of Microchip, the surviving corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries containing terms
(including with respect to limits, coverage, amount) no less favorable to such persons than the D&O insurance;
provided further, however, that Microchip and the surviving corporation will not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of three hundred percent of the amount paid by Microsemi for coverage for its last full fiscal
year, which such three hundred percent amount we refer to as the maximum annual premium, provided further
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such maximum annual premium, Microchip and
the surviving corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the maximum annual premium. Prior to the effective time of the merger, Microsemi may purchase a
six-year “tail” prepaid policy (which we refer to as the tail policy), on the D&O insurance on terms and
conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the D&O insurance and for a per annum amount not to exceed
three hundred percent of the amount paid by Microsemi for coverage for its last full fiscal year. In the event that
Microsemi does not purchase the tail policy, Microchip may purchase a tail policy on the D&O insurance
containing terms and conditions (including with respect to limits, coverage, amount) no less favorable to each
person covered by the D&O insurance immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, in the aggregate,
than the D&O insurance. In the event that either Microsemi or Microchip purchases such a tail policy prior to the
effective time of the merger, Microchip and the surviving corporation will maintain such tail policy in full force
and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of
Microchip and the surviving corporation under the first sentence of this paragraph for so long as such tail policy
is maintained in full force and effect.

The indemnified parties have the right to enforce the provisions of the merger agreement relating to their
indemnification. Such provisions may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any indemnified party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under a tail policy (and their
heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such person.

If Microchip or the surviving corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then proper provision will be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, assumes the obligations set forth
above relating to the indemnified parties.

Amendments

Subject to applicable law and subject to the other provisions of the merger agreement, the merger agreement
may be amended by the parties thereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
each of Microchip, Merger Sub and Microsemi; provided, however, that in the event that the merger agreement
has been approved by stockholders of Microsemi in accordance with Delaware law, no amendment will be made
to the merger agreement that requires the approval of such stockholders of Microsemi without such approval.
Notwithstanding anything in the merger agreement to the contrary, sections of the merger agreement relating to
the termination of the merger agreement, amendments of the merger agreement, third party beneficiaries of the
merger agreement, liability of the financing entities, consent to jurisdiction with respect to the financing entities,
and waiver of jury trial may not be amended, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse in any respect to
any of the financing entities without the prior written consent of the entities as of the date of such amendment that
are providing the financing.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Extension; Waiver

At any time and from time to time prior to the effective time of the merger, any party or parties to the merger
agreement may, to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth in the merger agreement,
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or parties to the
merger agreement, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
party or parties to the merger agreement contained in the merger agreement or in any document delivered
pursuant thereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party
or parties contained in the merger agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party or parties to the merger
agreement to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party or parties, as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this the merger agreement
will not constitute a waiver of such right.

(1) The estimated amount listed in this column for each executive officer represents the aggregate value of cash
severance that such executive officer would be entitled to receive from Microsemi under his respective
Retention Agreement upon a “double trigger” qualifying termination, where the executive officer’s
employment is terminated without cause or by the executive officer for good reason (as such terms are
defined in the Retention Agreements) following a change in control of Microsemi. For additional
information see the section entitled “The Merger — Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger — Executive
Retention Agreements” beginning on page 57. The estimated amount also includes the fiscal 2018 cash
incentive award that will be paid on a “single trigger” basis to each executive officer in connection with the
merger, assuming the maximum level of performance is achieved. The Compensation Committee of the
Board will determine the amount of fiscal 2018 cash incentive awards in connection with the merger, and
the actual cash incentive award could range from the executive officer’s target cash incentive award amount
to the maximum incentive award amount. For additional information see the section entitled “The Merger 
— Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger — Fiscal 2018 Executive Non-Equity Incentive Awards”
beginning on page 58.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NON-BINDING, ADVISORY VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION 
FOR MICROSEMI’S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K regarding
compensation for each of Microsemi’s executive officers (including Messrs Peterson, Pickle, Hohener, Litchfield
and Goren, who are Microsemi’s “named executive officers”) that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger.
This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and
in this section we use such term to describe the merger-related compensation payable to our named executive
officers. The “golden parachute” compensation payable to these individuals is subject to a non-binding, advisory
vote of Microsemi’s stockholders, as described below in this section.

The table below sets forth, for the purposes of this golden parachute disclosure, the amount of payments and
benefits that each of Microsemi’s executive officers would receive, assuming that (1) the effective time of the
merger occurred on March 30, 2018 (which is the assumed date solely for purposes of this golden parachute
compensation disclosure), and (2) each of Microsemi’s executive officers experienced a qualifying termination at
such time. The amounts below are determined using the merger consideration of $68.78 per share, and are based
on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the
assumptions described in the footnotes to the table. These amounts are based upon the executive officer’s
compensation levels in effect on March 30, 2018 and outstanding equity awards on March 30, 2018. As a result
of the foregoing assumptions, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by an executive officer may materially
differ from the amounts set forth below.

* As noted above, the actual amount of the fiscal 2018 cash incentive award for each executive officer
will be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board and will not be less than the
executive officer’s target cash incentive award amount and will not be greater than the executive
officer’s maximum incentive award amount. For purposes of this disclosure, the maximum annual
incentive award amounts have been assumed and are included in the tables above. The fiscal 2018 cash
incentive award for each of the executive officers at the target level of performance is as follows:

(2) Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and as described in the section entitled “The Merger — 
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger — Treatment of Outstanding Equity-Based and Performance
Awards” beginning on page 55, each of the executive officer’s Microsemi PSUs (other than the PSUs
granted to Mr. Peterson in July 2016) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
“single-trigger” vest as to a percentage of the total number of shares of Microsemi common stock subject to
the award and will be settled at the effective time of the merger, with the Compensation Committee of the
Board determining the applicable vesting percentage prior to the effective time of the merger
(which percentage will in no event be less than 100% of the target number of shares subject to the award or
greater than the maximum possible vesting percentage under the terms of the award).

executive officers, including the unvested time-based Microsemi RSUs (which includes any unvested new
RSU awards) and unvested cash consideration in settlement of unvested Microsemi restricted stock will
immediately vest upon a “double trigger” qualifying termination, where the executive officer’s employment

* As noted above, the Microsemi PSUs will vest between the target and maximum levels of performance.
For purposes of this disclosure, the maximum vesting levels have been assumed and included in the
tables above. The value of the Microsemi PSUs (other than the outstanding 250,000 PSUs granted to
Mr. Peterson in July 2016, which will, if outstanding and unvested at the effective time of the merger,
terminate (without payment) at that time). for each of the executive officers at the target level of
performance is as follows:

(3) This column includes, for each executive officer, (i) a lump sum cash payment of two times the executive
officer’s car allowance in effect at the time of termination (ii) the estimated value of medical, dental and
visions benefits and life insurance premiums for two years and (iii) a lump sum payment of accrued, but
unpaid vacation leave, which will be provided to the executive officer upon a “double trigger” qualifying
termination, where the executive officer’s employment is terminated without cause or by the executive
officer for good reason following a change in control, as described in the section entitled “The Merger — 
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger — Executive Retention Agreements” beginning on page 57.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For purposes of this note and the table above, the value of the Microsemi equity awards is calculated using
the merger consideration of  $68.78 per share multiplied by the number of shares of Microsemi common
stock subject to the award. For purposes of this disclosure, the number of shares of Microsemi common
stock subject to each Microsemi PSU (other than the PSUs granted to Mr. Peterson in July 2016) is assumed
to vest at the maximum level of performance. The outstanding 250,000 PSUs granted to Mr. Peterson in July
2016 will, if outstanding and unvested at the effective time of the merger, terminate (without payment) at
that time.

The following table illustrates the allocation of the aggregate total reported in the column for each executive
officer’s (i) Microsemi unvested time-based RSUs, (ii) Microsemi PSUs (other than the PSUs granted to
Mr. Peterson in July 2016) (assuming maximum level of performance), and (iii) Microsemi restricted stock.
As of March 30, 2018, the executive officers held no Microsemi options, nor did they hold any vested
Microsemi RSUs that had not previously been settled.

(4) As described above in the section entitled “The Merger — Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger — 
Executive Retention Agreements” beginning on page 57, Mr. Peterson is entitled to a “gross-up” payment in
the event any payments or benefits paid to him (whether “single trigger” or “double trigger”) are subject to
an excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code in an amount necessary to put him in the same
after-tax position as if no excise tax had been imposed and Microsemi’s other executive officers have
entered into letter agreements with Microsemi that provide in the event any payments and benefits provided
to the executive officer under any Microsemi plan or agreement would cause the executive officer to be
subject to an excise tax for “excess parachute payments” under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, then
such payments and benefits will be reduced if and to the extent a reduction in payments or benefits would
result in the executive officer retaining a larger amount on an after-tax basis than if the executive officer
received all the payments and benefits.

(5) This column includes, for each executive officer, the value of a lump sum payment of an amount equal to all
unvested company contributions credited to the executive officer’s Microsemi 401(k) plan account at the
time of termination, which will be provided to the executive officer upon a “double trigger” qualifying
termination, where the executive officer’s employment is terminated without cause or by the executive
officer for good reason following a change in control, as described in the section entitled “The Merger — 
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger — Executive Retention Agreements” beginning on page 57.

Microsemi does not have an obligation to pay a gross-up payment to any executive officer other than
Mr. Peterson. For purposes of this table, it is assumed that the compensation and benefits for each of the
executive officers will not be reduced in order to avoid any excise taxes under Sections 280G and 4999 of
the Code.

Merger-Related Compensation Proposal

Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) thereunder, Microsemi is seeking a non-
binding, advisory stockholder approval of the compensation of Microsemi’s named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise relates to the merger as disclosed above in this section. The proposal gives Microsemi’s
stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the merger-related compensation of Microsemi’s named
executive officers.

Accordingly, Microsemi is asking Microsemi stockholders to vote in favor of the adoption of the following
resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that will or may be paid or become payable to Microsemi’s named
executive officers, in connection with the merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which
such compensation will or may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t)
of Regulation S-K in “Non-Binding, Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation for Microsemi’s
Named Executive Officers” are hereby APPROVED.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The vote on the proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation is a vote separate and apart
from the vote on the merger proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to
approve the proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation and vice versa. If the merger is
completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to Microsemi’s named executive officers to the extent
payable in accordance with the terms of the compensation agreements and arrangements even if Microsemi
common stockholders fail to approve the proposal to approve the merger-related executive compensation.

The Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger-related
executive compensation.

VOTE ON ADJOURNMENT

Microsemi’s stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give the Board authority to adjourn
the special meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor
of the merger proposal, if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof to approve the merger proposal or in the absence of a quorum. If this adjournment proposal
is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned by the Board to any date or dates. In addition, the Board
could postpone the special meeting before it commences. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Microsemi is not
permitted to postpone or adjourn the stockholders’ meeting, except to the extent that (i) there are insufficient
shares of Microsemi common stock represented to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
special meeting, (ii) Microsemi reasonably determines that postponement or adjournment is required by
applicable law, including to comply with comments made by the SEC with respect to this proxy statement, or
(iii) Microsemi reasonably determines that such postponement or adjournment is necessary to solicit sufficient
proxies to obtain the requisite company vote to adopt the merger agreement. If the special meeting is adjourned
for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be
able to revoke them at any time before their use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish
to vote on any proposal, or if you sign and return a proxy and you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the
merger proposal but do not indicate a choice on the adjournment proposal, your shares of common stock will be
voted in favor of the adjournment proposal. The vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote separate and apart
from the vote on the merger proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to
approve the adjournment proposal and vice versa.

Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast
with respect to such proposal.

The Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

The following table sets forth certain information regarding beneficial ownership of Microsemi common
stock as of April 10, 2018, at which time there were 117,956,110 shares of our common stock outstanding.
Ownership information is included for (i) our directors, (ii) our named executive officers, (iii) all of our directors
and executive officers as a group and (iv) each person or entity we know to beneficially own more than 5% of our
common stock. Except as specified below and subject to applicable community property laws, each person or
entity listed below has sole voting and investment power with respect to the stock listed next to their name.
Applicable percentage ownership is based on 117,956,110 shares of our common stock outstanding on April 10,
2018. In computing the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by a person or entity and
the percentage ownership of that person or entity, we deemed outstanding shares of our common stock subject to
stock options, stock appreciation rights or warrants held by that person or entity that are currently exercisable
within 60 days of April 10, 2018. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

If the merger is completed, Microsemi’s stockholders will be entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL, provided that they comply with the conditions set forth in that statute.

Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, if you do not wish to accept the merger consideration provided for in
the merger agreement, you have the right to seek appraisal of your shares of our common stock and to receive
payment in cash for the fair value of your shares of our common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value. The “fair value” of your
shares of our common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be less than, equal to or more
than the $68.78 per share that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement.
These rights are known as appraisal rights. Microsemi’s stockholders who do not vote in favor of the merger
proposal and who properly demand appraisal for their shares in compliance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights. Strict compliance with the statutory procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL is required. Failure to follow precisely any of the statutory requirements will result in
the loss of your appraisal rights.

This section is intended only as a brief summary of certain provisions of the statutory procedures that a
stockholder must follow under the DGCL in order to seek and perfect appraisal rights. This summary, however, is
not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the
DGCL, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which appears in
Annex C to this proxy statement. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does
it constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.

Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, when a merger agreement will be submitted for adoption at a meeting
of stockholders, Microsemi must notify the stockholders who were stockholders of record on the record date for
notice of such meeting, not less than 20 days before the meeting to vote on the merger, that appraisal rights will
be available. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL must be included with the notice.

This proxy statement constitutes Microsemi’s notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in
connection with the merger and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex C, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. If you wish to exercise your
appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 of the DGCL contained in Annex C . Failure
to comply timely and properly with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of your
appraisal rights. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal
of shares of our common stock, Microsemi believes that a stockholder considering the exercise of such rights
should seek the advice of legal counsel.

If you wish to demand appraisal of your shares of our common stock, you must satisfy each of the following
conditions: (i) you must deliver to Microsemi a written demand for appraisal of your shares of our common stock
before the vote is taken to approve the merger proposal; (ii) the written demand must reasonably inform us of the
identity of the holder of record of shares of our common stock who intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its
shares of our common stock and that such stockholder intends to demand appraisal thereby; and (iii) you must not
vote or submit a proxy in favor of the merger proposal.

If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the merger is completed, you will be entitled to
receive payment for your shares of our common stock as provided in the merger agreement, but you will not have
appraisal rights with respect to your shares of our common stock. A holder of shares of our common stock
wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares of our common stock on the date the written
demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of our common stock of record through the
effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless
revoked, be voted “FOR” the merger proposal, and it will result in the loss of the stockholder’s right of appraisal
and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a
proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must either submit a proxy containing instructions to vote
“AGAINST” the merger proposal or “ABSTAIN” from voting on the merger proposal. Voting against or failing
to vote for the merger proposal by itself does not

TABLE OF CONTENTS

constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for
appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the merger proposal.

All demands for appraisal should be addressed to the Secretary at One Enterprise, Aliso Viejo, California
92656 and must be delivered to Microsemi before the vote is taken to approve the merger proposal at the special
meeting, and must be executed by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the shares of our common stock. The
demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs Microsemi of the identity of the stockholder and the intention
of the stockholder to demand appraisal of the “fair value” of his, her or its shares of our common stock. A
stockholder’s failure to deliver to Microsemi the written demand for appraisal prior to the taking of the vote on
the merger proposal at the special meeting of stockholders will result in the loss of appraisal rights.

Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares
registered in that holder’s name. Accordingly, to be effective, a demand for appraisal by a holder of our common
stock must be made by, or on behalf of, the record stockholder. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly,
the record stockholder’s name as it appears on the stockholder’s stock certificate(s) or in the transfer agent’s
records. The demand must state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the stockholder’s shares in
connection with the merger. The demand cannot be made by the beneficial owner if he or she does not also hold
the shares of our common stock of record. The beneficial holder must, in such cases, have the registered owner,
such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares of our
common stock. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee
and you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or the other
nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by the nominee and
obtaining notice of the effective date of the merger.

If shares of our common stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or
custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal must be made in that capacity. If the shares of our common stock
are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand must be
executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint
owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the
record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting as agent
for the record owner or owners. A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds
shares of our common stock as a nominee for others, may exercise his or her right of appraisal with respect to
shares of our common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other
beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of our common stock as to
which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of our common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand
will be presumed to cover all shares of our common stock held in the name of the record owner. If a stockholder
holds shares of our common stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities
depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of
the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record owner.

Within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation in the merger must give
notice of the date that the merger became effective to each of Microsemi’s record stockholders who has complied
with Section 262 of the DGCL and who did not vote in favor of the merger proposal. At any time within 60 days
after the effective time of the merger, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined
a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the stockholder’s demand and accept the merger consideration
specified by the merger agreement for that holder’s shares of our common stock by delivering to the surviving
corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the
demand made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require written approval of the
surviving corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, with such approval conditioned upon such
terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the
right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days
after the effective time. If the surviving

TABLE OF CONTENTS

corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or,
except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such stockholder’s right to appraisal in accordance with
the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the
dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value of his,
her or its shares of our common stock determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value may be less
than, equal to or more than the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement.

Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, either the surviving corporation or
any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the
Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of our common stock held
by all such stockholders. Upon the filing of the petition by a stockholder, service of a copy of such petition shall
be made upon the surviving corporation. The surviving corporation has no obligation to file such a petition, has
no present intention to file a petition and holders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a
petition. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the holders of our common stock to initiate all necessary petitions to
perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of our common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262
of the DGCL and the failure of a stockholder to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 of
the DGCL could nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal. In addition, within 120 days
after the effective time of the merger, any stockholder who has properly complied with the requirements of
Section 262 of the DGCL and who did not vote in favor of the merger proposal will be entitled to receive from
the surviving corporation, upon written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of our
common stock not voted in favor of the merger proposal and with respect to which demands for appraisal have
been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The statement must be mailed within 10 days
after such written request has been received by the surviving corporation or within 10 days after the expiration of
the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A person who is the beneficial owner of
shares of our common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such
person’s own name, file a petition for appraisal or request from the surviving corporation such statement.

If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the
surviving corporation, then the surviving corporation will be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a
copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and
addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares of our common stock and with
whom agreements as to the value of their shares of our common stock have not been reached. After notice to
stockholders who have demanded appraisal from the Register in Chancery, if such notice is ordered by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware Court of Chancery will conduct a hearing upon the petition and
determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled
to the appraisal rights provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require
stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares of our common stock to submit their stock certificates
to the Register in Chancery for notation of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; if any stockholder fails to
comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder.
Additionally, because our common stock is (and will be, immediately prior to the effective time) publicly listed
on Nasdaq, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required under Section 262 of the DGCL to dismiss the
proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total
number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock or (2) the value
of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares of common stock exceeds $1 million.

After determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of our common stock, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the shares of our common stock, determining their fair value as of the
effective time of the merger after taking into account all relevant factors exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. When the fair value has been determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
direct the payment of such value upon surrender by those stockholders of the certificates representing their shares
of our common stock (and in the case of uncertificated stock,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

forthwith). Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded
quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established
from time to time during the period between the effective time of the merger and the date of payment of the
judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to
each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter only upon
the sum of  (1) the difference, if any, between the amount paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.

You should be aware that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view of
the consideration to be received in a sale transaction, such as the merger, is not an opinion as to fair value under
Section 262 of the DGCL. Although we believe that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as
to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and stockholders
should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value that may be less than, equal to
or more than the merger consideration. Moreover, we do not anticipate offering more than the merger
consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal
proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of our common stock is
less than the merger consideration. In determining “fair value,” the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to
take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the
factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value
by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and
otherwise admissible in court” should be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all
relevant factors involving the value of a company.” Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be
“exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede &
Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does
not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value
arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court also stated that
“elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of
the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”

Costs of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts)
may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and imposed upon the surviving corporation and the
stockholders participating in the appraisal proceeding by the Delaware Court of Chancery, as it deems equitable
in the circumstances. Upon the application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts used in the appraisal
proceeding, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of our common stock entitled to appraisal. Any
stockholder who demanded appraisal rights will not, after the effective time of the merger, be entitled to vote
shares of our common stock subject to that demand for any purpose or to receive payments of dividends or any
other distribution with respect to those shares of our common stock, other than with respect to payment as of a
record date prior to the effective time of the merger. If no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the
effective time of the merger, or if the stockholder otherwise fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or loses such
holder’s right to appraisal, then the right of that stockholder to appraisal will cease and that stockholder’s shares
will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the $68.78 cash
payment (without interest) for each of his, her or its shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement. Inasmuch as Microsemi has no obligation to file such a petition, and Microsemi has no present
intention to do so, any holder of shares of our common stock who desires such a petition to be filed is advised to
file it on a timely basis. A stockholder will fail to perfect or effectively lose the right to appraisal if no petition for
appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger. In addition, as indicated above, a
stockholder may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal solely in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL and accept the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will result in
the loss of a stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights.

In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, Microsemi’s stockholders who may wish to
pursue appraisal rights should consult their legal and financial advisors.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF COMMON STOCK

If the merger is completed, our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the
Exchange Act and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of our common stock.

OTHER MATTERS

As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board knows of no matters that will be presented for
consideration at the special meeting other than as described in this proxy statement. The persons named as
proxies will vote the proxies, insofar as they are not otherwise instructed, regarding such other matters and the
transaction of such other business as may be properly brought before the meeting, as seems to them to be in the
best interest of our company and our stockholders.

HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS

In accordance with the rules of the SEC, we are delivering only one notice or, if applicable, one proxy
statement for the special meeting to multiple stockholders that share the same address unless we have received
contrary instructions from one or more of such stockholders. Upon oral or written request, we will deliver
promptly a separate copy of the proxy materials for the special meeting to a stockholder at a shared address to
which a single copy of the proxy materials was delivered. If you are a stockholder at a shared address to which
we delivered a single copy of the proxy materials for the special meeting and you desire to receive a separate
copy of the proxy materials, or if you desire to notify us that you wish to receive a separate copy of the proxy
materials in the future, or if you are a stockholder at a shared address to which we delivered multiple copies of
the proxy materials and you desire to receive one copy in the future, please submit your request to Investor
Relations, Microsemi Corporation, One Enterprise, Aliso Viejo, California 92656, (949) 380-6100.

If a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee holds your Microsemi shares, please contact your broker, bank,
trustee or other nominee directly if you have questions, require additional copies of the proxy materials, or wish
to receive multiple copies by revoking your consent to householding.

SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

If the merger is consummated, we will not have public stockholders and there will be no public participation
in any future meeting of our stockholders. However, if the merger is not completed, we expect to hold an annual
meeting of stockholders in 2019 (which we refer to as the 2019 Annual Meeting).

The deadline to receive Stockholder proposals under Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act to be considered for
inclusion in Microsemi’s proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting is August 22, 2018 (which is 120
calendar days before the date Microsemi’s proxy statement was released to stockholders in connection with the
prior year’s annual meeting of stockholders). If the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting is changed by more than
30 days from the anniversary date of the previous year’s annual meeting on February 13, 2018, then the deadline
will be a reasonable time before we begin to print and mail proxy materials. Upon receipt of any such proposal,
we will determine whether or not to include such proposal in the proxy statement and related proxy for the 2019
Annual Meeting in accordance with regulations governing the solicitation of proxies.

Stockholder proposals submitted for consideration at the 2019 Annual Meeting but not submitted for
inclusion in Microsemi’s proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8, including
stockholder nominations for candidates for election as directors, must be made not earlier than close of business
on October 16, 2018 and not later than the close of business on November 15, 2018 (provided, however, that if
the 2019 Annual Meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days from the first
anniversary of this year’s meeting, nominations and proposals must be received no

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARTICLE I 
DEFINITIONS & INTERPRETATIONS

1.1   Certain Definitions.   For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the following capitalized terms
shall have the following respective meanings:

“Acquisition Proposal” means any offer, proposal or indication of interest from any Third Party relating to
any Acquisition Transaction.

“Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) involving: (a) any acquisition or purchase by any Third Party, directly or
indirectly, of twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of outstanding voting or equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any tender offer (including a self-tender) or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any Third Party beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of
outstanding voting or equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (b) any merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, joint venture or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction hold
less than eighty percent (80%) of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction;
(c) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the
ordinary course of business), acquisition or disposition of twenty percent (20%) or more of the assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (measured by the lesser of book or fair market value thereof as of the last day
of the Company’s last fiscal year); (d) any liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other significant corporate
reorganization of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with assets which, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company or to which twenty percent
(20%) or more of the consolidated revenues or earnings of the Company are attributable; or (e) any combination
of the foregoing.

“Affiliate” means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly controls, is

ARTICLE II 
THE MERGER

2.1   The Merger.   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation. The Company, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, is sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the “Surviving Corporation.”

2.2   The Effective Time.   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the
Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated under Delaware
Law by filing a certificate of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the “Delaware Secretary of State”) in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the
time of such filing by the Delaware Secretary of State, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Parent
and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger, being referred to herein as the “Effective Time”).

2.3   The Closing.   The consummation of the Merger shall take place at a closing (the “Closing”) to occur at
the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, One Market Street, Spear Tower,
Suite 3300, San Francisco, California, 94105, on a date and at a time to be agreed upon by Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company, which date shall be no later than the second (2 ) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted hereunder) of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their terms are only capable of being satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder), of such conditions) or at such other location, date
and time as Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall mutually agree upon in writing; provided that,
notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or written waiver
(to the extent permitted hereunder) of those conditions at the Closing), if the Marketing Period has not ended on
such date, the Closing shall not be required to occur until the earlier of  (a) any Business Day during the
Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less than three (3) Business Days’ prior notice to the Company and
(b) two (2) Business Days after the final day of the Marketing Period, but subject, in the case of each of clauses
(a) and (b), to the continued satisfaction or written waiver (where permissible) of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are only capable of being satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or written waiver (where permissible) of those conditions at the Closing), unless
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall mutually agree upon another location, date and time in writing. The
date upon which the Closing shall actually occur pursuant hereto is referred to herein as the “Closing Date”.

2.4   Effect of the Merger.   At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company

Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

2.5   Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

(a)   Certificate of Incorporation.   At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section 6.13, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth

incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law and such certificate of incorporation.

(b)   Bylaws.   At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section 6.13, the bylaws of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the bylaws of the Surviving

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2.6   Directors and Officers.

(a)   Directors.   At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified.

(b)   Officers.   At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are
duly appointed and qualified.

2.7   Effect on Capital Stock.

(a)   Capital Stock.   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, or the holders of any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

(i)   Company Common Stock.   Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) Cancelled Shares, (B) Dissenting Shares and
(C) Unvested Restricted Stock) shall be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon the
surrender of  (A) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the “Certificates”) and
(B) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the “Uncertificated Shares”) in the manner
provided in Section 2.8 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon delivery of an
affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in Section 2.10).

(ii)   Owned Company Common Stock.   Each share of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, the Company, or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company (the
“Cancelled Shares”), in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(iii)   Capital Stock of Merger Sub.   Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation, and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of
Merger Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b)   Adjustment to Merger Consideration.   If, during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock shall occur as a
result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend with a record date during such period (but, for
clarity, excluding any change that results from any exercise of options, the payment of restricted share units,
performance share units or similar awards, or as a result of the grant of new options, restricted share units,
performance share units or similar awards by the Company), the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

(c)   Statutory Rights of Appraisal.

(i)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled
Shares) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented
thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the “Dissenting Shares” until
such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder’s appraisal rights
under Delaware Law with respect to such shares)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to
payment of the appraised value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; provided
that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder’s right to
appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of
Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.7(a)(i), without interest
thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such
Uncertificated Share, as the case may be.

(ii)   The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and
any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant
to Delaware Law that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to such demands; provided,
that, all costs incurred by Parent in connection with such participation in and direction of such Legal
Proceedings shall be borne exclusively by Parent. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

(d)   Company Compensatory Awards.

(i)   Unvested Company Restricted Stock Units.   At the Effective Time, each award of Company
Restricted Stock Units (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and unsettled immediately prior to the
Effective Time, to the extent then unvested (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting pursuant
to the terms of the award in connection with the Merger), shall, by virtue of the Merger, be assumed by
Parent (each, an “Assumed RSU”). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each
Assumed RSU shall be equal to the product of  (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit award as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number, rounded
down to the nearest whole share). Such Assumed RSUs will otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions as applied to the related award of Company Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including the same vesting schedule and any accelerated vesting provisions applicable
thereto.

(ii)   Vested Company Restricted Stock Units.   At the Effective Time, each award of Company
Restricted Stock Units (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and unsettled immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is then vested or will vest pursuant to its terms in connection with the Merger
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the vested portion of the Company Restricted Stock Unit
award immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting that may
be required in connection with the Merger under the terms of the award) multiplied by (y) the Merger
Consideration (the “RSU Consideration”).

(iii)   Company Performance Stock Units.   At the Effective Time, each award of Company
Performance Stock Units (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall vest as to a percentage of the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such award to be determined prior to the Closing by the Compensation Committee of the Company
Board (which percentage, for purposes of clarity, may be greater than 100% but in no event will be less
than 100% or greater than the maximum possible vesting percentage under the terms of the award) and
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the vested portion of the Company Performance Stock
Unit award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to the foregoing
determination of the Compensation Committee and any other accelerated vesting that may be required
in connection with the Merger under the terms of the award) multiplied by (y) the Merger
Consideration (the “PSU Consideration”).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(iv)    Company Options and Company Stock Appreciation Rights.   At the Effective Time, each
Company Option and Company Stock Appreciation Right (or portion thereof) that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Parent (each,
individually an “Assumed Option” or “Assumed SAR”). Each such Assumed Option or Assumed SAR
shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the related Company Option or
Company Stock Appreciation Right immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting
schedule and any accelerated vesting provisions applicable thereto, except that (A) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed Option or Assumed SAR shall be equal to the
product of  (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Assumed Option or
Assumed SAR as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (B) the per
share exercise price of each Assumed Option or Assumed SAR shall be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing (x) the exercise price per share at which such Assumed Option or Assumed
SAR was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio
(with the resulting price per share rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Each Assumed Option so
assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as defined in
Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted under Section 422 of the Code and to the extent such
Assumed Option qualified as an incentive stock option prior to the Effective Time, and, further, that the
assumption of Assumed Options or Assumed SARs pursuant to this Section shall be effected in a
manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this Section 2.7(d)(iv) will be construed consistent with this
intent.

(v)   Restricted Stock.   Each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time and is subject to a restricted stock award agreement,
(“Unvested Restricted Stock”), shall be canceled and extinguished at the Effective Time and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration
as provided in Section 2.7(a)(i); provided, however, that the right of the holder of such Unvested
Restricted Stock to receive such cash payment shall be subject to the same vesting conditions
(including any applicable acceleration provisions provided under the terms of the award) as applied to
the share of Company Common Stock to which such payment of the Merger Consideration relates (and,
if and to the extent such vesting conditions are not satisfied, the holder will not be entitled to such
payment of the Merger Consideration). Any Merger Consideration payable with respect to the
Unvested Restricted Stock pursuant to the terms hereof shall be paid on or reasonably promptly after
(and in all events within fifteen (15) Business Days (or, as to Unvested Restricted Stock held by a
Person employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries outside of the United States, thirty (30)
Business Days) after) the applicable vesting date.

(vi)   Non-US Company Compensatory Awards.   Notwithstanding the provisions above, Parent
and the Company may, prior to the Effective Time, agree that any Company Compensatory Award that
is subject to the Applicable Laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction may be treated in a manner other than as
prescribed by this Section 2.7(d), as applicable, to the extent that (i) Parent and the Company
reasonably and in good faith determine that (A) the manner in which such Company Compensatory
Award would otherwise be treated pursuant to this Section 2.7(d) would result in a violation of
Applicable Laws or a materially adverse tax consequence to the individual holding such Company
Compensatory Award in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and (B) such different treatment is
necessary to comply with such Applicable Laws and (ii) such different treatment is, to the maximum
extent practicable, consistent with the applicable provisions of this Section 2.7(d). Parent and the
Company shall agree at least ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time to the treatment of any Company
Compensatory Award that will be treated in a manner other than as prescribed by this Section 2.7(d).

(vii)   Resolutions; Form S-8.   The Company shall adopt resolutions of the Company Board or a
committee thereof to provide for the treatment of the Company Compensatory Awards as contemplated
by this Section 2.7(d). Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than

fifteen (15) Business Days following the Effective Time), if available for use by Parent, Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) relating
to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed or converted Company
Compensatory Awards under this Section 2.7(d). Parent shall take all actions necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by, and in accordance with, this Section 2.7(d), including issuing, effective
as of the Effective Time, the Assumed RSUs, Assumed Options and Assumed SARs.

(e)   Special Shares.   The Series A-1 special shares and the Series B-1 Special Shares of Microsemi
Storage Solutions Ltd., (the “Special Shares”) a Canadian subsidiary of the Company, shall remain
outstanding, and subject to and from and after the Effective Time, the holders of each Special Share shall,
pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, be entitled to receive, upon the exchange or retraction
(i.e., redemption at the option of the holder) thereof, in lieu of the consideration that would have been
payable in respect of such MSS Special Shares, an amount in cash, without interest as determined by the
terms of the Exchange Agreement, equal to (as applicable):

(i)   for each Series 1-A Special Share, the result of  (i) $68.78 multiplied by 8 multiplied by
0.0771 plus (ii) $9.22 multiplied by 8; and

(ii)  for each Series 1-B Special Share, the result of  (i) $68.78 multiplied by 2.18448 multiplied
by 0.0771 plus (ii) $9.22 multiplied by 2.18448.

2.8   Exchange of Certificates.

(a)   Payment Agent.   Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a nationally recognized bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the
“Payment Agent”).

(b)   Exchange Fund.   Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Unvested Restricted Stock) and the Company Compensatory Awards pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II, an amount of cash equal to the sum of  (I) the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Merger
Consideration by (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) plus (II) all
such cash amounts and to be paid pursuant to Section 2.7(d) at the Closing (other than Escrowed
Compensatory Payments) (such aggregate cash amount being referred to herein as the “Exchange Fund”).
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than for the purpose provided for in this
Agreement and shall be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Cancelled Shares, Dissenting
Shares and Unvested Restricted Stock) and the holders of Company Compensatory Awards. In the event that
the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this Article II, Parent shall
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Payment Agent in an amount sufficient
to make such payments.

(c)   Payment Procedures.   As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, but in any event
within five days following the Closing Date, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment
Agent to mail (i) to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by Certificates (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form and
containing customary provisions (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent) and (B) instructions for use

Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity and

permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

party(ies) thereto (the “Debt Financing Sources”) has/have committed to provide, subject only to the terms
and conditions set forth therein, debt financing for the Merger in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the
“Debt Financing”). Any reference in this Agreement to (i) “Debt Commitment Letters” will include such
documents as amended or modified in compliance with the provisions of Section 6.15, and (ii) the “Debt
Financing” will include the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as amended or
modified in compliance with the provisions of Section 6.15. Parent has, or has caused one of its Subsidiaries
to have, fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees that have been incurred and are due and
payable in connection with the Debt Commitment Letters prior to or in connection with the execution of this
Agreement and Parent has otherwise satisfied all of the other terms and conditions required to be satisfied by
it prior to the execution of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters. Each of
the Debt Commitment Letters, in the form so delivered to the Company, is in full force and effect and is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto,
enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Limitations.
Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Article VII and assuming the accuracy of
the Company’s representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and performance by the Company
of its obligations hereunder, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no facts or circumstances in existence as
of the date hereof that would cause any of the Debt Financing Conditions to not be satisfied.

(b)   As of the date hereof, (i) none of the Debt Commitment Letters has been amended or modified,
and no such amendment or modification is contemplated by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other
party thereto (other than as set forth in the fee letters with regard to flex rights and/or to add additional
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement), and (ii) none of the respective commitments set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letters have been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Except as set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letters, as of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements relating to the Debt Financing. No event has occurred which, with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any term or condition of the
Debt Commitment Letters, or otherwise result in any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated thereby to
be unavailable. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Debt Financing or that would permit the Debt Financing Sources to reduce the total amount of
the Debt Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters in the form so delivered to the
Company (the “Debt Financing Conditions”).

4.9   Funds.    Parent will have (and will cause Merger Sub to have), immediately prior to the Effective
Time, sufficient funds to satisfy and perform all of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations under this Agreement,
including to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and all amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.7. Parent
acknowledges that its obligations under this Agreement are not conditioned upon or subject to its receipt of the
proceeds made available under the Debt Commitment Letters or any other Debt Financing.

4.10   No Reliance.    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article IV or any other provision hereof,
each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other Person on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is making (or has made) any representation or warranty
whatsoever, express or implied, written or oral, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied on, and each of
Parent and Merger Sub hereby disclaims reliance on, any representation, warranty, or other statement or omission
of the Company, any other Person acting on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, beyond those
expressly given in Article III; provided that, the foregoing shall not be deemed to limit or waive any rights or
remedies of Parent or Merger Sub with respect to fraud in connection with the making of the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in Article III.

non-public information) relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement the terms of which are no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the

similar provision that would prohibit such Third Party from making any Acquisition Proposal) and

Third Party the Company shall provide the notice required by Section 6.1(d) (and if such Acquisition
Proposal is in written form, the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof) and notice of the Company’s
intention to engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non-public information to,
such Third Party, and (2) contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information to such Person, the

Agreement; provided, however, that any such action taken by any Representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (other than any member of the Company Board, the Company Board’s financial advisor or
outside legal counsel or any member of the Company’s executive management) shall not be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 6.1 by the Company, unless such action was authorized, directed or knowingly
permitted by any member of the Company Board or any member of the Company’s executive management.

(d)   The Company shall promptly, and in all cases within twenty-four (24) hours of its receipt, advise

effect a Company Board Recommendation Change and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e)
(ii) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal at any time prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, if and only if:

(i)   (A) the Company Board has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach (or deemed breach) of Section 6.1 that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) the

breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law, (C) prior to
effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company shall have (1) given Parent at
least four (4) Business Days’ notice (the “Notice Period”) of its intention to take such action (which
notice shall include the most current version of the proposed definitive agreement and, to the extent not

their capacity as such, as such Superior Proposal (it being understood that (x) any material revision to

Company Board as of or prior to the date of this Agreement (such material fact, event, change,
development or set of circumstances, an “Intervening Event”) shall have occurred and be continuing,

failure to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law, (C)
prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company shall have (1) given
Parent at least four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which
notice shall include a written explanation of the Company Board’s basis and rationale for proposing to
effect such Company Board Recommendation Change) and (2) if requested by Parent, negotiated with
Parent in good faith during such four (4) Business Day notice period any modifications to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent, in its discretion, and (D) Parent shall not have made, within the
four (4) Business Day notice period, a written offer or proposal capable of acceptance that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside
legal counsel, would obviate the need for the Company Board to effect such Company Board
Recommendation Change.

under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act other than a “stop, look and listen”
communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act or any similar
communication to stockholders of the Company shall be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation
Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in

(f)   The Company shall not take any action to (i) approve any transaction under, or any Third Party
becoming an “interested stockholder” under, Section 203 of the DGCL, (ii) exempt any Person (other than

Stockholder Approval. Subject to Section 6.1 and Section 6.2, the Company shall solicit from stockholders of the
Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting.
Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall establish a record date

any Governmental Entity or to prevent the initiation of any lawsuit by any Governmental Entity under any
antitrust or competition law or to prevent the entry of any decree, judgment, injunction, preliminary or
permanent, or any order that would otherwise make the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
unlawful. Notwithstanding the forgoing anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is expressly
understood and agreed that: neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be under any obligation to make proposals,
execute or carry out agreements, enter into consent decrees or submit to orders providing for (A) the sale,

Company would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
material adverse effect on the business, operations, financial condition or results of operations of Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(e)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not knowingly take any
action (including the acquisition by it or its Affiliates of any interest in any Person that derives revenues
from products, services or lines of business that compete with the Company’s products, services or lines of
business) if such action would make it materially more likely that there would arise any impediments under
any Antitrust Law with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

reasonably request and (y) furnish to Parent such existing financial and operating data and other existing
information as such Persons may reasonably request, and afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable
access to officers and employees of the Company in order to discuss such data and information; provided,

Subsidiaries to, afford access or disclose any information that in the good faith judgment of the Company
would (a) violate any obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Third Party, (b) jeopardize
protections afforded the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the attorney-client privilege or attorney
work product doctrine, or (c) violate any Applicable Law or Order. In the event that the Company does not
provide access to or disclose information to Parent in reliance on the final proviso of the preceding sentence,
it shall use reasonable best efforts to communicate such information in a manner that does not result in the
violation of any such obligation, Law or Order or the jeopardy of such protections. Any investigation by
Parent pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be conducted under supervision of appropriate personnel of the
Company and in such manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the
Company, and shall not include the collection or analysis of any environmental samples.

deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided under
this Section 6.6 and Section 6.5 or otherwise as either “Outside Counsel Only Material” or “Antitrust

in advance from the Company or its legal counsel. Antitrust Restricted Material and the information
contained therein shall be given only to outside antitrust counsel and other outside Representatives of the

disclosed by such Persons to other employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission
is obtained in advance from the Company or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.6 or Section 6.5 or otherwise may
be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company and the Merger and
other confidential information, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as
necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

6.7   Notification.    The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing, and Parent shall promptly notify

contemplated hereby; (b) any written communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the

any its stockholder (on their own behalf or on behalf of it) relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and shall keep the other Parties reasonably informed regarding any
such Legal Proceeding. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding

stockholder litigation and shall not settle any such stockholder litigation without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Company have previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated November 20, 2017 (the “Confidentiality
Agreement”), which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, effective as of the execution and delivery hereof, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall be deemed to be amended so as to permit Parent to make any counter-offer or proposal contemplated by
Section 6.2(c) or Section 8.1(e)(ii) (which deemed amendment shall survive any termination of this Agreement in

Subsidiaries, unless Parent provides written notice to the Company no later than five (5) business days prior

any case adopt resolutions effective no later than the Effective Time eliminating Company stock as the
funding vehicle for matching contributions and as an available investment under any such 401(k) plan, as

401(k) plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any outstanding participant
loans from such 401(k) plans, to Parent’s 401(k) plan, except to the extent accepting such transfers would
adversely affect the tax-qualified status of the Parent 401(k) plan.

(b)   From the Effective Time through the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the “Transition
Period”), Parent will provide or cause to be provided to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time working in the United States who continues employment with Parent or any of its
direct or indirect Subsidiaries (each, an “Affected Employee”), while employed by Parent or any of its direct
or indirect Subsidiaries, compensation and benefits the value of which is not less favorable to the Affected
Employee in the aggregate to the aggregate value of the compensation and benefits provided to such
Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c)   During the Transition Period, (i) each Affected Employee, while employed by the Parent or any of
its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, will be provided base wages or salary, as applicable, that are not less than
the base wages or salary, as applicable, provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) each Affected Employee will be provided severance benefits not less favorable in
amount or with regard to terms and conditions to receive such severance benefits than those provided to the
Affected Employee by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d)   From and after the Effective Time, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any
employee benefit plans in which the Affected Employees are entitled to participate to take into account for
all purposes, including eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and benefit accrual (but not for benefit accrual
purposes under any defined benefit pension plan, unless required by Applicable Law), thereunder, service
for the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessors) as if such service were with Parent,
to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation with respect to the same period of service), and
Affected Employees will be immediately eligible to participate in any such plans, without any waiting
period, to the extent such Affected Employee was eligible to participate in the comparable Employee Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent any health or welfare benefit plan replaces an
Employee Plan that is a health or welfare benefit plan, Parent will, and will cause its direct and indirect
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) to use its or their reasonable best efforts to (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting condition exclusions, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements, and all waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Affected Employee to the
extent waived or satisfied under the replaced Employee Plan and (ii) credit each Affected Employee for any
applicable amounts (whether in the nature of co-payments or coinsurance amounts, amounts applied toward
deductibles or other out-of-pocket expenses) under the terms of the replaced Employee Plan toward
satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements under the health benefit plan
that replaces such an Employee Plan for the plan year in which the transition between plans occurs.

(e)   Nothing contained in this Section 6.12 or any other provision of this Agreement (i) will be
construed to amend or modify, as of the date of this Agreement, any Employee Plan, or any benefit,
compensation or severance plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement sponsored by the
Company, Parent or their Affiliates, (ii) will limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any benefit, compensation or severance plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or
arrangement that is assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by Parent or its Affiliates, provided any
such amendment, modification or termination must comply with the terms thereof and Applicable Law, (iii)
will create any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person (including any Affected Employee)
other than the parties to this Agreement, or (iv) will limit the right of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) to
terminate, in accordance with Applicable Law, the employment or service of any employee or other service
provider during the Transition Period.

under their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents)
and all agreements for indemnification, exculpation of liability or advancement of expenses, in effect as of
the date hereof between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former
directors, officers, employees and agents or any person who becomes a director, officer, employee or agent
prior to the Effective Time (the “Indemnified Parties”). For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

(b)   For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain in effect the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the
D&O Insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts
no less favorable than those of the D&O Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation may, at its option, substitute therefor policies of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms (including with respect to
limits, coverage, amount) no less favorable to such persons than the D&O Insurance, provided further,
however, that in satisfying its obligations under this Section 6.13(b), Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid
by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the
“Maximum Annual Premium”) (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in
Section 6.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter), provided further that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to
the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may
purchase a six-year “tail” prepaid policy (the “Tail Policy”) on the D&O Insurance on terms and conditions
no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the D&O Insurance and for a per annum amount not to exceed three
hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year. In the
event that the Company does not purchase the Tail Policy, Parent may purchase a Tail Policy on the D&O
Insurance containing terms and conditions (including with respect to limits, coverage, amount) no less
favorable to each person covered by the D&O insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time, in the
aggregate, than the D&O Insurance. In the event that either the Company or Parent shall purchase such a
Tail Policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such Tail Policy
in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this Section 6.13(b) for so
long as such Tail Policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(c)   The obligations under this Section 6.13 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under a
Tail Policy referred to in Section 6.13(b) (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written
consent of such person. Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the
D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in Section 6.13(b) (and their heirs and representatives) are
intended to be Third Party beneficiaries of this Section 6.13, with full rights of enforcement as if a party
thereto.

(d)   In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be
made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.13. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in

(b)   No Amendments to Debt Commitment Letters.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Debt Commitment Letters without the
prior written consent of the Company if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to consummate the Merger (taking into
account other sources of funding), or (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms to the Debt
Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing,
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to: (A) materially delay, prevent or impede the
consummation of the Merger, or (B) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing, or the satisfaction of
the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing, materially less likely to occur; provided, that Parent and any
of its Subsidiaries may consent to, replace or amend the Debt Financing to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as
of the date hereof. In addition to the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, not release or
consent to the termination of the Debt Commitment Letters or of any individual lender under the Debt
Commitment Letters, except for (x) assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the terms
of, and only in connection with, the syndication of the Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letters,
or (y) replacements of the Debt Commitment Letters with alternative financing commitments pursuant to
Section 6.15(c). Parent shall promptly, and in any event within three (3) Business Days, provide copies of
any executed amendment to the Debt Commitment Letters to the Company.

(c)   Alternate Debt Financing.   In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing Section 6.15(b), in
the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letters (after giving effect to all applicable flex provisions), Parent shall promptly
notify the Company, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i) obtain alternative financing from alternative sources
on terms and conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than those set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letters and in an amount at least equal to the amount (taking into account cash on hand

new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the “New Debt
Commitment Letters”), which New Debt Commitment Letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment
Letters in whole or in part. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any New Debt
Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith, which such fee letter may be redacted in a
customary manner). In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in
this Agreement to the “Debt Commitment Letters” will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters
to the extent not superseded by the New Debt Commitment Letters at the time in question and any New
Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect, and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the “Debt
Financing” means the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to
the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in
this Section 6.15 shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries be deemed or construed to require, either Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to (A) pay any fees or
any interest rates applicable to the Debt Financing in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters (including the flex provisions), or (B) agree to any “market flex” term less favorable to Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries than such corresponding market flex term contained in or contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters (in either case, whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or
otherwise).

(d)   Information.   Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of
the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing, and Parent shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Debt Financing Sources to, provide the Company with such access to the Debt Financing
Sources as the Company may reasonably request for the purpose of allowing the Company to understand the
status of Parent’s efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon
having actual knowledge of any material breach by any party of any of the Debt Commitment Letters or any
termination of any of the Debt Commitment Letters.

(e)   Company Support.

(i)   Prior to the Closing Date, subject to Section 6.15(e)(ii), the Company will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and, will use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, at
Parent’s sole expense, use reasonable best efforts to provide Parent and its Subsidiaries with all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to assist it in causing the
conditions in the Debt Commitment Letters to be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably requested by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt Financing, the Alternative Financing and
any other debt or capital markets (including private placement) financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), including any issuance of equity,
equity-linked securities or securities that are not equity-linked (together with the Debt Financing, the
“Financing”), and in each case that is customary in connection with Parent’s efforts to obtain the
Financing, including:

6.18   Actions with Respect to Existing Debt.

(a)   Provided that this Agreement shall not have been validly terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1, the Company shall, upon receiving any written request by Parent to do so, use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly commence a tender offer (the “Notes Tender Offer”) for all of the outstanding
principal amount of its 9.125% Senior Notes due in fiscal year 2023 (the “Senior Notes”); provided,
however, that if Parent so elects in its sole discretion, in lieu of or in addition to the Notes Tender Offer, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate a covenant defeasance pursuant to Section 8.03 of
the Senior Notes Indenture or a discharge pursuant to Section 11.01 of the Senior Notes Indenture upon the
prior or simultaneous occurrence of the Closing and the consummation of the Financing on the Closing
Date, in either case as reasonably requested by Parent in writing; provided that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation funds any such defeasance or discharge. As part of any Notes Tender Offer, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes to amend, eliminate or
waive certain sections (as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company) of the Senior Notes Indenture (the
“Notes Consents”“). The aggregate consideration payable to each holder of Senior Notes pursuant to the
Notes Tender Offer shall be an amount in cash established and funded by Parent. The Notes Tender Offer
shall be made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement prepared by the
Company in connection with the Notes Tender Offer in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent
and the Company; provided that any such Notes Tender Offer shall be subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 6.18(b) (as amended from time to time, the “Notes Offer to Purchase”).

(b)   The Company’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligation to accept for payment and pay for the
Senior Notes tendered pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer or make any payment for the Notes Consents shall
be subject to conditions (as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company), including that (i) the Merger shall
have occurred (or Parent and the Company shall be satisfied that it will occur substantially concurrently with
such acceptance and payment), (ii) the Financing has been obtained and (iii) such other conditions as are
customary for transactions similar to the Notes Tender Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Notes Tender Offer, substantially concurrently with the Closing, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation to accept for payment and thereafter to promptly pay for all Senior Notes (and related Notes
Consents) validly tendered and not withdrawn. The Company shall waive any of the conditions to the Notes
Tender Offer as may be reasonably requested by Parent (other than the conditions that the Notes Tender
Offer is conditioned on the Closing having occurred and the Financing as provided in clauses (i) and (ii)
above), so long as such waivers would not cause the Notes Tender Offer to violate the Exchange Act, the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”), or any other Applicable Law, and shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Notes Tender Offer or make any change,
amendment or modification to the terms and conditions of the Notes Tender Offer (including any extension
thereof) other than as agreed between Parent and the Company or as required in the reasonable judgment of
the Company to comply with Applicable Law.

(c)   Upon the request of Parent pursuant to Section 6.18(a), the Company shall prepare, as promptly as
practicable, the Notes Offer to Purchase, together with any required related letters of transmittal and similar
ancillary agreements (such documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being
referred to herein collectively as the “Notes Tender Offer Documents”), relating to the Notes Tender Offer
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be disseminated to the record holders of the Senior Notes,
and to the extent known by the Company, the beneficial owners of the Senior Notes (collectively, the
“Noteholders”) the Notes Tender Offer Documents; provided, however, that prior to the dissemination
thereof, the Company shall provide copies thereof to Parent not less than ten (10) Business Days in advance
of any such dissemination (or such shorter period of time as is reasonably practicable in light of when Parent
requests that the Company commence the Notes Tender Offer) and shall consult with Parent with respect to
the Notes Tender Offer Documents and shall include in such Notes Tender Offer Documents all comments
reasonably proposed by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company. Upon request, Parent shall
provide the Company with any information for inclusion in the Notes Tender Offer Documents which may
be required under Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Company. If at any time prior to the
acceptance of Senior Notes pursuant to the Notes Tender Offer any event should occur that is required

by Applicable Law to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Notes Tender Offer
Documents, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare and disseminate such amendment or
supplement; provided that prior to such dissemination, the Company shall provide copies thereof to Parent
not less than two (2) Business Days (or such shorter period of time as is reasonably necessary in light of the
circumstances) in advance of any such dissemination and shall consult with Parent with respect to such
amendment or supplement and shall include in such amendment or supplement all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent. The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, the TIA, and any other Applicable Law in connection with the Notes Tender Offer.

(d)   Promptly following the expiration of any consent solicitation, assuming the requisite consents
from Noteholders (including from Persons holding proxies from the Noteholders) have been received, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause an appropriate supplemental indenture (the
“Supplemental Indenture”) to become effective providing for the amendments of the Senior Notes Indenture
contemplated in the Notes Tender Offer Documents; provided, however, that notwithstanding the fact that
the Supplemental Indenture may become effective earlier, the proposed amendments set forth therein shall
not become operative unless and until all conditions to the Notes Tender Offer have been satisfied or waived
by the Company in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof and the Surviving Corporation accepts all
Senior Notes (and related Notes Consents) validly tendered for purchase and payment pursuant to the Notes
Tender Offer, whereupon such proposed amendments shall become operative. The form and substance of the
Supplemental Indentures shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company.

(e)   Provided that this Agreement shall not have been validly terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1, the Company shall, upon receiving any written request by Parent to do so, use its reasonable
best efforts to undertake an optional redemption (the “Optional Redemption”) of all the outstanding
principal amount of its Senior Notes in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture. The Optional
Redemption shall be subject to conditions (as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company), including that
(i) the Closing shall have occurred (or Parent and the Company shall be satisfied that the Closing will occur
substantially concurrently with such acceptance and payment), (ii) the Financing has been obtained and (iii)
such other conditions as are customary for similar optional redemptions. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Optional Redemption or make any change,
amendment or modification to the terms and conditions of the Optional Redemption (including any
extension thereof) other than as agreed between Parent and the Company. Upon the request of Parent
pursuant to this clause (e), the Company shall prepare, as promptly as practicable, a notice of optional
redemption relating to the Optional Redemption (the “Optional Redemption Notice”), which Optional
Redemption Notice shall satisfy all applicable requirements of the Senior Notes Indenture, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Optional Redemption Notice to be delivered to the holders of the Senior
Notes in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture; provided, however, that prior to such delivery, the
Company shall provide copies thereof to Parent not less than ten (10) Business Days in advance of any such
delivery (or such shorter period of time as is reasonably practicable in light of when Parent requests that the
Company commence the Optional Redemption) and shall consult with Parent with respect to the Optional
Redemption Notice and shall include in such Optional Redemption Notice all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company.

(f)   Company Reimbursement and Indemnification.

(i)   Upon request by the Company, Parent shall promptly (and in any event within thirty (30)
calendar days of invoice) reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented legal fees and expenses) incurred by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Section 6.17 including (a) all costs and
expenses relating to the preparation, printing, filing, mailing and publishing of any Notes Tender Offer
Documents, (b) all fees and expenses of any tender agent, (c) all advertising charges in connection with
a Notes Tender Offer, including those of any public relations firm or other person or entity rendering

9.7   Other Remedies.

(a)   Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity
upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy.

(b)   No Financing Party (i) shall have any liability or obligation to the parties hereto with respect to
this Agreement or with respect to any claim or cause of action (whether in contract or in tort, in Applicable
Law or in equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing
of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine,
including alter ego or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be
connected with, or relate to: (A) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder, (B) the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in,
in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), (C) any breach or violation of this Agreement,
and (D) any failure of the transactions contemplated hereunder to be consummated, it being expressly agreed
and acknowledged by the parties hereto that no personal liability or losses whatsoever shall attach to, be
imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Financing Party, as such, arising under, out of, in connection
with or related to the items in the immediately preceding clauses (A) through (D) or (ii) shall have any rights
or claims against the Company and of its Subsidiaries, Representatives or shareholders, arising out of this
Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with the Financing;
provided that following the Closing and the consummation of the Financing, the foregoing will not limit any
rights the Financing Sources have against the Company and its Subsidiaries under the definitive
documentation governing the Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.7(b) does not limit or
affect any rights or remedies that Parent may have against the parties to the Debt Commitment Letters.

9.8   Specific Performance.    The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) were not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to equitable relief
without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, including to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and specific performance and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in the courts described in Section 9.10, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity. The Parties acknowledge that the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties hereto have an adequate remedy
at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this Section 9.8 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order
or injunction.

9.9   Governing Law.    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of law thereof.

9.10   Consent to Jurisdiction.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARTICLE XI

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a “proceeding”), by reason
of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer,
of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification
rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability
and loss (including attorney’s fees, judgments, fines, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered
by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to
be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators: provided, however, that, except as provided in paragraph (b) hereof, the Corporation shall
indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the
right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final
disposition: provided, however, that, if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires, the
payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not
in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including
without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall
be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Section or otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide
indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing
indemnification of directors and officers.

If a claim under paragraph (a) of this Section is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after a
written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be
entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than
an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the
claimant has not met the standards of conduct which makes it permissible under the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of
proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or
she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

The right to the indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance
of its final disposition conferred in this Section shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may
have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

ANNEX B 

March 1, 2018

Board of Directors 
Microsemi Corporation 
One Enterprise 
Aliso Viejo, CA 92656

Members of the Board:

We understand that Microsemi Corporation (the “Company”), Microchip Technology Incorporated
(“Parent”), and Maple Acquisition Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), propose to
enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated March 1, 2018 (the
“Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company (the “Merger”). Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent and each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.20 per share, of the Company (“Company
Common Stock”), other than shares owned by Parent, the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent or the Company, shares as to which appraisal rights have been properly exercised and
Unvested Restricted Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into the right to receive
$68.78 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in
the Merger Agreement.

You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, other than Parent or any affiliate of Parent (the “Holders”), pursuant to, and
in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.

For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed a draft, dated March 1, 2018, of the Merger
Agreement (the “Draft Merger Agreement”), certain related documents and certain publicly available financial
statements and other business and financial information of the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-
looking information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, including financial
projections and operating data of the Company (collectively, the “Company Projections”). Additionally, we
discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior
executives of the Company. We also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for Company
Common Stock and compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of
Company Common Stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In
addition, we reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and
performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have
deemed appropriate.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to, or
discussed with, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections, we have been advised by the
management of the Company, and have assumed, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial
performance of the Company and other matters covered thereby, including that they reflect the assessment of the
management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks
associated with such technology and products. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in
accordance with the terms set forth in the Draft Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay
that would be material to our analysis. We also have assumed that the final executed Merger Agreement will not
differ in any material respect from the

Draft Merger Agreement reviewed by us. In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all
the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed
that could have an adverse effect on the Holders receiving the Merger Consideration and that would be material
to our analysis. We have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent
or otherwise) of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this
transaction and will receive a fee for our services payable upon rendering of this opinion. We will also receive an
additional, larger fee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our
expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two year period prior
to the date hereof, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst or any of its affiliates and the Company or
Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst or its affiliates; however, Qatalyst and/or its
affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company or Parent and
their respective affiliates for which we or they would expect to receive compensation.

Qatalyst provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals,
domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In the ordinary course of these
activities, affiliates of Qatalyst may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise effect
transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.

This opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice. This
opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other
purpose without our prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any
Holder should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter and does not in any manner address the prices
at which Company Common Stock will trade at any time.

Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this
opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or
reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in
the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to
the Company. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration
to be received by the Holders pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement, and we
express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the
Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to such Merger Consideration.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Merger
Consideration to be received by the Holders pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger
Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.

Yours faithfully,

/s/ QATALYST PARTNERS LP

ANNEX C 

SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE

§ 262. Appraisal rights

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a
demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares
through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this
section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing
pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the
stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used
in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and
“share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a
receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions
thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent
corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to
§ 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, §
256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights
under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository
receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of
the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a
national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no
appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if
the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as
provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are
required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256,
257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or
depository receipts in respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares
of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the
merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more
than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing
paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares
or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under
§ 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal
rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by
§ 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the
procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as
nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted for the words “merger or consolidation”, and
the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting
corporation”.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section
shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all
or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply
as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to
be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the
meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or
such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which
appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are
available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy
of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of  § 114 of this
title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the
corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand.
A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided.
Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this
subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the
merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this
title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the
surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or
series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the
merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of
stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of  § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if
given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the
effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within
20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of
this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days
after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the
appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of
the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date
of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such
constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders
on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more
than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §
251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title
and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each
stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in
accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of
the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders
entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a

record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the
notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such
effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date
shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is
otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who
has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or
consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has
complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be
entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement
setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such
written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for
such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held
either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition
or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the
surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register
in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all
stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their
shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the
surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in
Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition
by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list
at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before
the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or
such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be
approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this
section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have
demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates
of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any
stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If
immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent
corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall
dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless

(1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or
series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for
such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267
of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing
appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the

shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its
discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from
the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and
shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to
time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any
time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder
entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon
the sum of  (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by
the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or
resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in
its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an
appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation
pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that
such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the
surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such
stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented
by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s
decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or
resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court
deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of
the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded
appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or
to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions
payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation);
provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of
this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of
such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within
60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall
cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to
any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s
demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders
would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized
and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
