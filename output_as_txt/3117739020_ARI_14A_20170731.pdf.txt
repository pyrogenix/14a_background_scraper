ARI Network Services, Inc.
10850 West Park Place, Suite 1200

Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53224
July 31, 2017

To the Shareholders of ARI Network Services, Inc.:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of shareholders (the “Special Meeting”) of ARI Network Services, Inc., a
Wisconsin corporation (“ARI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), to be held on August 28, 2017, at 9:00 a.m., local time, at 10850
West Park Place, Suite 1200, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53224.

At the Special Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of
Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), dated June 20, 2017, by and among ARI, Expedition
Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), and Expedition Merger Sub, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation and a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). Parent and Merger Sub were formed by affiliates of True Wind Capital, L.P.
(“TWC”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into ARI (the “Merger”), and ARI will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. At the Special Meeting, you will also be asked to consider and vote on a non-binding,
advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection with
the Merger.

If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $7.10 in cash, without interest, for each share of common stock that you
own, which represents a premium of approximately 33% to ARI’s average closing price for the period of 60 trading days ending June
20, 2017, the date of the Merger Agreement.

The Board of Directors of ARI (the “Board” or “Board of Directors”), after considering the factors more fully described in
the enclosed proxy statement, has unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable to, fair to and in the best interests of ARI and its
shareholders; and (2) adopted and approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the approval and adoption of
the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3)
“FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the Special Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the Merger. A
copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement. The proxy statement also describes the actions and
determinations of the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. We encourage you
to read the proxy statement and its annexes, including the Merger Agreement, carefully and in their entirety, as they contain important
information.

Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, please sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed
proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone. If you
attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy that you have previously submitted.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in
accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other
nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, without your
instructions.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. We cannot complete the Merger unless the
proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the outstanding shares of ARI common stock.

If you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares, please contact our Proxy Solicitor:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 11/179

 
Parent, Merger Sub and TWC are affiliated with True Wind Capital Management, LLC (“True Wind”), a San

Francisco-based private equity firm managing $560 million focused on investing in leading technology companies.

The Merger

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub will
merge with and into ARI, and ARI will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (the “Surviving Corporation”). As a result of the Merger, ARI will cease to be a publicly traded company, all
outstanding shares of ARI common stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $7.10 per share in
cash, less any applicable withholding taxes (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”), and you will not own any shares of
the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but you will
no longer have any rights as a shareholder of ARI.

Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock, Performance Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units

The Merger Agreement provides that ARI’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the time at
which the Merger will become effective (the “Effective Time”) will be subject to the following treatment at the Effective
Time:

Options

All outstanding options to purchase shares of Company common stock (whether or not then vested or exercisable)
at the Effective Time of the Merger will be cancelled and converted into the right of the option holders to receive for
each share of common stock subject to the option holder’s option, an amount in cash equal to: (x) $7.10, minus (y) the
sum of (1) the exercise price per share of common stock of such option, and (2) any applicable withholding amounts.

Restricted Stock

All outstanding restricted shares (other than the performance restricted shares described below) immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger will vest in full and become free of restrictions and convert into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to $7.10, less any applicable withholding amounts.

Performance Restricted Shares

All or a portion of the unvested performance restricted shares (which were granted to certain employees of ARI in
March of 2015 and vest based on certain share price targets) at the Effective Time of the Merger will vest in accordance
with the terms of such grant agreements, and such vested portion of the performance restricted shares will become free
of restrictions and convert into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $7.10, less any applicable withholding
amounts.

Any performance restricted shares that remain unvested at the Effective Time will be forfeited, and the number of
shares of common stock outstanding at the Effective Time of the Merger will be reduced accordingly.

Restricted Stock Units

Any restricted stock units (“RSUs”) outstanding, if any, at the Effective Time of the Merger will entitle the holder
to receive an amount, if any, for each share of common stock in respect of which such holder received an RSU whether
or not then vested in accordance with the terms of such grant agreements, equal to (x) $7.10, less (y) any applicable
withholding amounts.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Prior to the Effective Time, the Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Board of
Directors of ARI (the “Board” or “Board of Directors”) will determine a date prior to the Effective Time on which the
then-current offering period under ARI’s 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the “Employee Stock
Purchase Plan”) will terminate, and accumulated payroll deductions with respect to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
on that date will be used to purchase the applicable number of shares of ARI common stock. The Employee Stock
Purchase Plan will terminate immediately following the termination date of the then-current offering period.

Financing of the Merger

We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger and the related transactions will be approximately
$140 million, which will be funded via equity financing and debt financing described below and potentially with the
Company’s cash on hand, which may be used to pay certain fees and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub. This
amount includes funds needed to (i) pay our shareholders the amounts due to them under the Merger Agreement; (ii)
make payments due as of the Effective Time in respect of our outstanding equity-based awards pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, (iii) pay all fees and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement and Parent’s
agreements with the Lender, and (iv) pay certain specified debt of ARI.

In connection with the Merger, Parent has (i) entered into an equity commitment letter, dated as of June 20, 2017,
with TWC, for an equity commitment of up to $93,341,000, and (ii) obtained debt financing commitments from the
Lender, pursuant to which the Lender has committed to provide Parent with up to $72.5 million under a senior credit
facility, comprised of a $7.5 million revolving credit facility, which will be available to fund a portion of the payments
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and a $55 million to $65 million term loan facility. For more information, see
the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Financing of the Merger,” beginning on page 56 of this
proxy statement.

Conditions to the Closing of the Merger

The obligations of ARI, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, to consummate the Merger are subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including (among other conditions), the following:
 

•
 

all waiting periods under the HSR Act (as defined below) will have been terminated or expired;
 

•
 

the consummation of the Merger not being made illegal or otherwise prohibited by any law or order of any
governmental authority of competent jurisdiction;

 

•
 

shareholder approval of the Merger and Merger Agreement will have been obtained and will be in full force and
effect;

 

•
 

the accuracy of the representations and warranties of ARI, Parent and Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement,
subject to materiality qualifiers (generally other than as would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in the section captioned “The Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties—ARI”) or, in the

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

ARI and Parent have agreed to use their commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all regulatory notification
requirements and obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals include the expiration or early termination of the applicable
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (“HSR Act”). Early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act was granted on July 14, 2017.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors

The Board of Directors, after considering various factors described under the caption “The Merger—
Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously: (1) determined that the
Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable to, fair
to and in the best interests of ARI and its shareholders; and (2) adopted and approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends
that you vote (1) “FOR” the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the
Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and
adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-
binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger.

Opinion of ARI’s Financial Advisor

Pacific Crest Securities, a division of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. (“PCS”), and Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc.
(“HLC”), were retained by the Board of Directors to act as financial advisors in connection with the Merger. On June
20, 2017, PCS rendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated June 20, 2017, to
the Board of Directors to the effect that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by PCS as
set forth in its written opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of ARI
common stock (other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of
view to such holders of shares of ARI common stock.

The full text of PCS’ written opinion to the Board of Directors, dated June 20, 2017, is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex B and is incorporated by reference herein. The written opinion sets forth, among other
things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the
review undertaken by PCS in rendering its opinion. You should read the written opinion carefully in its entirety.
The opinion was provided to the Board of Directors and addresses only, as of the date of the written opinion, the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares
of ARI common stock (other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and it does not
address any other aspect of the proposed transactions. It does not constitute a recommendation as to how any
shareholder should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter, and does not in any manner address the
price at which ARI common stock will trade at any time. The summary of the written opinion set forth herein is
qualified in its entirety by reference to

Interests of ARI’s Directors and Named Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to approve
and adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and named executive officers may have
interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder. In (i) evaluating and
negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii) recommending that
the Merger Agreement be approved and adopted by shareholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered
these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. These interests include the following:
 

•
 

accelerated vesting of stock options, restricted shares, and a portion of performance restricted shares and the
termination or settlement of such applicable awards that are in-the-money in exchange for cash;

 

•
 

the entitlement of each named executive officer to receive payments and benefits under either an employment
agreement or the Change in Control Agreements in connection with an involuntary termination of employment
other than for “cause,” as such term is defined in the applicable employment agreement or Change of Control
Agreement, or if the executive officer voluntarily terminates his employment for “good reason,” as such term is
defined in the applicable employment agreement or Change of Control Agreement, within the two year period
following the Effective Time;

 

•
 

continued employment of ARI’s officers by the Surviving Corporation anticipated following the Effective Time;
and

 

•
 

continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the Surviving
Corporation.

If the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement is approved, we anticipate that the shares of common
stock held by our directors and named executive officers as of the Effective Time will be treated in the same manner as
outstanding shares of common stock held by all other shareholders. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of ARI’s Directors and Named Executive Officers in the Merger,”
beginning on page 51 of this proxy statement.

Legal Proceedings Regarding the Merger

On July 21, 2017, a putative class action lawsuit was filed by a purported shareholder of ARI against ARI and its
directors in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, captioned Sean Sharkey et al v. ARI Network
Services, Inc. et al, Case No. 17-cv-1012. The action generally alleges failure to adequately disclose material
information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The
plaintiff seeks, among other things, equitable relief to enjoin consummation of the Merger, rescission of the Merger
and/or rescissory damages, and attorneys’ and experts’ fees. ARI and the individual defendants all believe that the
claims asserted against each of them are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit.

defendants, Parent, Merger Sub and TWC all believe that the claims asserted against each of them are without merit and
intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit.

Appraisal Rights

No dissenters’, appraisal or similar rights or demands are exercisable by any ARI shareholder in connection with
the merger under Section 180.1302(1) or Section 180.1302(2) of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the
“WBCL”).

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The
Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares of common
stock in the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction. Such receipt of cash by each U.S. Holder will generally
result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that
such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock
surrendered in the Merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash
in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup
withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a
valid exemption from backup withholding tax.

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger,” beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement. Shareholders should consult their own
tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax and other relevant tax consequences relating to the Merger in
light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign
taxing jurisdiction.

Acquisition Proposals

Under the Merger Agreement, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or
termination of the Merger Agreement, ARI has agreed to cease and to cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with any person or its affiliates, directors, officers, managers, employees, consultants, agents, financing
sources, attorneys, accounting, representatives and other advisors with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. ARI has
agreed that neither it nor its subsidiaries will, and ARI will not instruct, authorize or knowingly permit its and its
subsidiaries’ representatives to, directly or indirectly:
 

•
 

solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making of, or knowingly encourage, any proposal, inquiry or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the section
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals”);

 

•
 

engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any external discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any
non-public information or data, or afford access to ARI’s business, employees, properties, assets, books, or
records to any person (other than to Parent, Merger Sub or their designees) relating to, or that would reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

 

•
 

knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal;
 

•
 

approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal;

 

•
 

enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal (except for a Comparable

Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in the section captioned “The Merger Agreement—Acquisition
Proposals”)).

Notwithstanding these restrictions, under certain circumstances, prior to the approval of the Merger Agreement by
ARI shareholders, ARI may provide information of ARI and its subsidiaries to, and engage or participate in negotiations
or discussions with, and afford access to the business, employees, properties, assets, books and records of ARI, the
person that submitted such written Acquisition Proposal provided that ARI’s Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal (as defined in the
section captioned “The Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals”) or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal and not to do so would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of their
fiduciary duties. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—
Acquisition Proposals,” beginning on page 71 of this proxy statement.

Change of Recommendation

The Board of Directors has unanimously recommended that you vote for the approval and adoption of the Merger
and the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that the Board of Directors may not change its
recommendation, or take other actions constituting a Change of Recommendation, except in certain specified
circumstances. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—The
Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation,” beginning on page 72 of this proxy statement.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

The Merger Agreement may be terminated prior to the Effective Time in the following ways:
 

•
 

By mutual written consent of ARI and Parent;
 

•
 

By either ARI or Parent:
 

-
 

subject to certain exceptions, if the Merger has not been consummated on or before December 20, 2017, which
date we refer to as the “Outside Date;”

 

-
 

if there will be a permanent injunction, restraining order, ruling or decree of any nature of any governmental
entity that is in effect that restrains, enjoins or prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; and/or

 

-
 

if ARI’s shareholders fail to approve the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special
Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, at which a vote on such proposal is taken.

 

•
 

By ARI:
 

-
 

if any representation or warranty of the Parent or the Merger Sub has become untrue or upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation by the Parent or the Merger Sub, which (i) would result in the
failure of certain of ARI’s closing conditions and (ii) such failure is not capable of being cured, or is not cured
by Parent or Merger Sub, before the earlier of the Outside Date or, if curable or able to be performed by the
Outside Date, the date that is 30 calendar days following ARI’s delivery of written notice thereof, it being
understood that ARI will not be entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement if such breach has been cured prior
to termination; provided that any failures related to the financing of the Merger is provided for below;

 

-
 

at any time prior to shareholder approval of the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for a Superior Offer in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement;

transactions; and/or

-
 

if (i) all of the conditions applicable to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s closing conditions have been satisfied or, to
the extent permitted by and the Merger Agreement, waived, (ii) ARI has irrevocably notified Parent in writing
that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing, (iii) ARI has given Parent three business days’
notice prior to such termination stating ARI’s intention to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Parent and
Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger by the Closing Date, and (iv) Parent fails to complete the Closing
on the later of the expiration of the three business day period, and the Closing Date.

 

•
 

By Parent:
 

-
 

in the event the Board will have made a Change of Recommendation; and/or
 

-
 

if any representation or warranty of ARI has become untrue or upon a breach or failure to perform of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation by ARI, which (i) would result in the failure of certain of
Parent’s and Merger Sub’s closing conditions and (ii) such failure is not capable of being cured, or, if curable
or able to be performed, is not cured by Parent or Merger Sub, before the earlier of the Outside Date and the
date that is 30 calendar days following ARI’s delivery of written notice thereof, it being understood that Parent
will not be entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement if such breach has been cured prior to termination.

Termination Fees and Expense Reimbursement

Except in specified circumstances, whether or not the Merger is completed, ARI, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, are each responsible for all of their respective costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. ARI will be required to pay to
Parent a termination fee of $4,767,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances. Parent will
be required to pay to ARI a reverse termination fee of $8,264,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under different
specified circumstances. For more information on these termination fees, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expense Reimbursement,” beginning on page 81 of this
proxy statement.

Effect on ARI if the Merger is Not Completed

If the Merger Agreement is not approved and adopted by shareholders or if the Merger is not completed for any
other reason, shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, ARI will remain an
independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and we will continue to file periodic reports
with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Under specified circumstances, ARI will be required to
pay Parent a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement; under different specified circumstances,
Parent will be required to pay ARI a reverse termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement. For more
details see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expense
Reimbursement,” beginning on page 81 of this proxy statement.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote

You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of common stock at the close of business on
July 28, 2017 (the “Record Date”). You will have one vote at the Special Meeting for each share of common stock that
you owned at the close of business on the Record Date.

Purpose

At the Special Meeting, we will ask shareholders to vote on proposals to (1) approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement; (2) adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) approve, by non-binding,
advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection with
the Merger.

Quorum

As of the Record Date, there were 17,369,872 shares of ARI common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. A quorum will be present at the Special Meeting if a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the
holders of the outstanding shares of ARI common stock at the close of business on the Record Date are represented in
person or by proxy.

Required Vote

The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes that holders of the outstanding shares of ARI common stock at the
close of business on the Record Date are entitled to cast is required to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.
Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at
the Special Meeting by the holders of shares of ARI common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote
on the proposal. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable to ARI’s
executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the
Special Meeting by the holders of shares of ARI common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on
the proposal.

Share Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the
aggregate, 1,830,732 shares of ARI common stock, representing approximately 10.18% of the shares of common stock
outstanding on the Record Date. Our directors and executive officers have executed voting agreements obligating them
to vote all of their shares of common stock (1) “FOR” the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement; and (2)
“FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and have further
informed us that they currently intend to vote (3) “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation
that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Voting and Proxies

Any shareholder of record entitled to vote may submit a proxy by returning a signed proxy card by mail in the
accompanying prepaid reply envelope or granting a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, or may vote
in person by appearing at the Special Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of common stock in
“street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how
you wish to vote your shares of common stock using the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.
Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the

discretion to vote on routine matters. The proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting are non-routine matters, and
banks, brokers and other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important
that you cast your vote or instruct your bank, broker or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.

If you are a shareholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at
the Special Meeting by (1) signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it prior to the Special Meeting; (2)
submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy; (3)
delivering a written notice of revocation to ARI’s Secretary; or (4) attending the Special Meeting and voting in person
by ballot.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee
for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a
“legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

  Q:
 

What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on ARI?
 

A:
 

The proposed Merger is the acquisition of ARI by Parent. If the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement is
approved by shareholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived,
Merger Sub will merge with and into ARI, with ARI continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger,
ARI will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will
be delisted from NASDAQ. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no
longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

 

Q:
 

What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
 

A:
 

Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each share of
ARI common stock that you own. For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock, you will receive $710.00 in
cash in exchange for your shares of common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.

 

Q:
 

How does the Per Share Merger Consideration compare to the market price of the common stock?
 

A:
 

The relationship of the $7.10 Per Share Merger Consideration to the trading price of the common stock constituted a
premium of approximately 33% to ARI’s average closing price for the period of 60 trading days ending June 20, 2017,
the date of the Merger Agreement.

 

Q:
 

What do I need to do now?
 

A:
 

We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer to in
this proxy statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as
possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the
Internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street
name,” please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.
Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

 

Q:
 

Should I send in my stock certificates now?
 

A:
 

No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send your
ARI stock certificates to the paying agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of common
stock represented by your stock certificates. You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates
for the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

 

Q:
 

What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the
Special Meeting?

 

A:
 

The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is
expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of ARI common stock after the Record Date but before the
Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to
whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies ARI in writing of such special arrangements,
you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to
whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if
you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date
and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over
the Internet or by telephone.

 

Q:
 

How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?
 

A:
 

The Board of Directors, after considering the various factors described under the caption “The Merger—
Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” has

9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 22/179

    unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement are advisable to, fair to and in the best interests of ARI and its shareholders; and (2) adopted and
approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies
if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3)
“FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by ARI
to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 

Q:
 

What happens if the Merger is not completed?
 

A:
 

If the Merger Agreement is not approved and adopted by shareholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other
reason, shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of ARI common stock. Instead, ARI will remain an
independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under
the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.

   

ARI will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $4,767,000 upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under
specified circumstances, and Parent will be required to pay to ARI a reverse termination fee of $8,264,000 if the Merger
Agreement is terminated under different specified circumstances, in each case as described in the section captioned “The
Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expense Reimbursement,” beginning on page 81 of this proxy statement.

 

Q:
 

What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
 

A:
 

The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes that holders of the outstanding shares of ARI common stock at the close
of business on the Record Date are entitled to cast is required to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.

   

If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any shareholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card;
(2) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone; or (3) vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in
“street name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee
how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.

 

Q:
 

What vote is required to approve any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special
Meeting and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to
its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?

 

A:
 

Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at
the Special Meeting by the holders of shares of ARI common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote
on the proposal. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to
its named executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at
the Special Meeting by the holders of shares of ARI common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote
on the proposal.

   

The failure of any shareholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the Internet or by
telephone; or (3) vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal or
the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 23/179

    instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on the adjournment
proposal and the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by
ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Abstentions will not have any effect on the
adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become
payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 

Q:
 

Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become
payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger?

 

A:
 

SEC rules require ARI to seek a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become payable by
ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 

Q:
 

What is the compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger for purposes of this advisory vote?

 

A:
 

The compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the
Merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the Merger and payable to certain of ARI’s named executive
officers. For further detail, see the section captioned “Proposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-Related
Executive Compensation Arrangements.”

 

Q:
 

What will happen if shareholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger at the Special Meeting?

 

A:
 

Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger is not a condition to completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the compensation that will or
may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger is an advisory vote and will
not be binding on ARI or Parent. If the Merger Agreement is approved and adopted by the shareholders and the Merger
is completed, the compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection
with the Merger will or may be paid to ARI’s named executive officers even if shareholders fail to approve such
compensation.

 

Q:
 

What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
 

A:
 

If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company,
you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “shareholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and
your proxy card have been sent directly to you by ARI.

   

If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of
common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker
or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the shareholder of record. As the beneficial
owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their
instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the shareholder
of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your
bank, broker or other nominee.

 

Q:
 

How may I vote?
 

A:
 

If you are a shareholder of record (that is, if your shares of ARI common stock are registered in your name with
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:

 

•
 

by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;

14



9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 24/179

 
 

•
 

by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;
 

•
 

by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or
 

•
 

by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.
   

A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of
ARI common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting
electronically over the Internet or by telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your
shares, if you vote electronically over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and
telephone charges for which you will be responsible.

   

Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of ARI
common stock by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially
own, you may still vote your shares of ARI common stock in person by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have
previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your previous vote
by proxy will not be counted.

   

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank,
broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee,
or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone.
To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the
instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.

 

Q:
 

If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
 

A:
 

No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be
considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should
follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote of your shares. Without instructions, your
shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted against the approval and
adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, by
non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger.

 

Q:
 

May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?
 

A:
 

Yes. If you are a shareholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at
the Special Meeting by:

 

•
 

signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
 

•
 

submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 

•
 

delivering a written notice of revocation to the Secretary; or
 

•
 

attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.
   

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a
“legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

 

Q:
 

What is a proxy?
 

A:
 

A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of common stock. The
written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy
statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a “proxy card.” Our
Board of Directors has designated Roy W. Olivier, our Chief Executive Officer, and William A.

9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 25/179

    Nurthen, our Chief Financial Officer, and each of them, with full power of substitution, as the proxy holders for the
Special Meeting.

 

Q:
 

If a shareholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
 

A:
 

Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When
completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for
or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special
Meeting.

   

If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter,
the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (1) “FOR” the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies
if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3)
“FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by ARI
to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 

Q:
 

What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

A:
 

You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple
proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you
will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a
shareholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.

   

Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone) each proxy card and
voting instruction card that you receive.

 

Q:
 

Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
 

A:
 

If available, ARI may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. ARI intends to
publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All
reports that ARI files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. See the section of this proxy statement captioned
“Where You Can Find More Information.”

 

Q:
 

Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?
 

A:
 

If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”), the exchange of ARI common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, which generally will require you to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash you received pursuant to the Merger
and your adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding tax
may also apply to the cash payments made pursuant to the Merger, unless the U.S. Holder complies with certification
procedures under the backup withholding tax rules.

   

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of ARI common stock for
cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States. A Non-U.S. Holder may,
however, be subject to backup withholding tax with respect to the cash payments made pursuant to the Merger, unless
the holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup
withholding tax.

   

You should consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax and other relevant tax consequences
of the Merger to you in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any
state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences
of the Merger is

    provided under the caption “The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”
 

Q:
 

What will the holders of ARI stock options, restricted stock, performance restricted shares and restricted stock
units receive in the Merger?

 

A:
 

All outstanding options to purchase shares of Company common stock (whether or not then vested or exercisable) at the
Effective Time of the Merger will be cancelled and converted into the right of the option holders to receive an amount in
cash an amount, if any, for each share of common stock subject to the option holder’s option, equal to: (x) $7.10, minus
(y) the sum of (1) the exercise price per share of common stock of such option, and (2) any applicable withholding
amounts.

   

All outstanding restricted shares (other than the performance restricted shares described below) immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger will vest in full and become free of restrictions and convert into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $7.10, less any applicable withholding amounts.

   

All or a portion of the unvested performance restricted shares (which were granted to certain employees of ARI in
March of 2015 and vest based on certain share price targets) at the Effective Time of the Merger will vest in accordance
with the terms of such grant agreements, and such vested portion of the performance restricted shares will become free
of restrictions and convert into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $7.10, less any applicable withholding
amounts. Any performance restricted shares that remain unvested will be forfeited, and the number of shares of common
stock outstanding at the Effective Time of the merger will be reduced accordingly.

   

Any RSUs outstanding, if any, at the Effective Time of the Merger will entitle the holder to receive an amount, if any, for
each share of common stock in respect of which such holder received an RSU whether or not then vested in accordance
with the terms of such grant agreements, equal to (x) $7.10, less (y) any applicable withholding amounts.

 

Q:
 

What will happen to participants in ARI’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan?
 

A:
 

Prior to the Effective Time, the Compensation Committee will determine a date prior to the Effective Time on which the
then-current offering period under ARI’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan will terminate, and accumulated payroll
deductions with respect to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan on that date will be used to purchase the applicable
number of shares of ARI common stock. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan will terminate immediately following the
termination date of the then-current offering period.

 

Q:
 

When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
 

A:
 

We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger in the
third calendar quarter of 2017. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the
Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, many of which are outside of our control.

 

Q:
 

Am I entitled to appraisal rights?
 

A:
 

No. No dissenters’, appraisal or similar rights or demands are exercisable by any ARI shareholder in connection with the
merger under Section 180.1302(1) or Section 180.1302(2) of the WBCL.

 

Q:
 

Do any of ARI’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of ARI shareholders
generally?

 

A:
 

Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to approve and adopt the
Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that
are different from, or in addition to, the interests of ARI shareholders generally. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the
Merger Agreement; (ii) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii) recommending that the Merger
Agreement be approved and adopted by shareholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests
to the extent that they existed at the time, among

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement, the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement and information included in oral
statements or other written statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain “forward-looking statements” that
do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts. You can typically identify forward-looking statements by the use of
forward-looking words, such as “predicts,” “plan,” “expects,” “focus,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “goal,” “target,” “estimate,”
“potential,” “may,” “will,” “might,” “momentum,” “can,” “could,” “design,” “see,” “seek,” “forecast” and other words of
similar import. Shareholders are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and
may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward-looking
statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in our filings with the SEC,
including in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in
this proxy statement, and the following factors:
 

•
 

the inability to complete the Merger due to the failure to obtain shareholder approval or failure to satisfy the other
conditions to the completion of the Merger, including receipt of required regulatory approvals;

 

•
 

the failure by Parent to obtain the necessary equity and debt financing set forth in the commitments entered into in
connection with the Merger, or alternative financing, or the failure of any such financing to be sufficient to complete
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

 

•
 

the fact that, although Parent must use reasonable best efforts to obtain the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, there is a risk that the debt financing might not be obtained and that, in certain instances, ARI’s
only viable recourse would be the $8,264,000 reverse termination fee payable by Parent under the terms of the Merger
Agreement;

 

•
 

the risk that the Merger Agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay Parent a termination fee
of $4,767,000;

 

•
 

the outcome of legal proceedings, if any, that may be instituted against us and others related to the Merger Agreement;
 

•
 

risks that the proposed Merger disrupts our current operations or affects our ability to retain or recruit key employees;
 

•
 

the fact that receipt of the all-cash Per Share Merger Consideration would be taxable to shareholders that are treated as
U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

 

•
 

the fact that, if the Merger is completed, shareholders will forego the opportunity to realize the potential long-term
value of the successful execution of ARI’s current strategy as an independent company;

 

•
 

the possibility that Parent could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including restructuring efforts,
special dividends or the sale of some or all of ARI’s assets to one or more as-yet unknown purchasers, that could
conceivably produce a higher aggregate value than that available to shareholders in the Merger;

 

•
 

the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, ARI is prohibited from soliciting other alternative proposals
during the pendency of the Merger;

 

•
 

the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on ARI’s business relationships, operating results and
business generally;

 

•
 

the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger;
 

•
 

risks related to the Merger diverting management’s or employees’ attention from ongoing business operations;
 

•
 

risks that our stock price may decline significantly if the Merger is not completed; and

•
 

risks related to the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals from various domestic and foreign governmental entities
required in connection with the Merger (including any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed on these approvals)
and the risk that one or more governmental entities may deny approval.

Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this proxy statement are qualified by the
information contained or incorporated by reference herein, including (1) the information contained under this caption and (2)
the information contained under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and
information in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our most recent filings on Form 10-K and
Form 10-Q. No assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from
the forward-looking statements.

Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Shareholders are advised to consult any future disclosures that we
make on related subjects as may be detailed in our other filings made from time to time with the SEC.

THE SPECIAL MEETING

The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors for use at the Special Meeting.

Date, Time and Place

We will hold the Special Meeting on August 28, 2017, at 9:00 a.m., local time, at 10850 West Park Place, Suite 1200,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53224.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the Special Meeting, we will ask shareholders to vote on proposals to (i) approve and adopt the Merger Agreement,
(ii) adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting and (iii) approve, by non-binding, advisory vote,
compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum

Only shareholders of record as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special
Meeting. A list of shareholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal executive offices,
located at 10850 West Park Place, Suite 1200, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53224, during regular business hours beginning two
business days after the notice of the Special Meeting and at the place of the Special Meeting during the meeting.

As of the Record Date, there were 17,369,872 shares of ARI common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting.

A quorum will be present at the Special Meeting if a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the
outstanding shares of ARI common stock at the close of business on the record date are represented in person or by proxy. In
the event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit
additional proxies.

Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes that holders of the outstanding shares of ARI common stock at the close
of business on the Record Date are entitled to cast is required to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. Adoption of the
Merger Agreement by shareholders is a condition to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at
the Special Meeting by the holders of shares of ARI common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on
the proposal. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common
stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the
subject matter.

If a shareholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the shareholder voted “AGAINST”
the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement. For shareholders who attend the meeting or are represented by
proxy and abstain from voting, the abstention will have the no effect on the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later
date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the
Special Meeting no effect on the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become
payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Each “broker non-vote” will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement, but will have no effect on (i) any proposal to adjourn

the Special Meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting or (ii) the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation
that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. A “broker non-vote”
generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the
bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares.

Shares Held by ARI’s Directors and Executive Officers

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the
aggregate, 1,830,732 shares of ARI common stock, representing approximately 10.18% of the shares of common stock
outstanding on the Record Date. Our directors and executive officers have executed voting agreements obligating them to
vote all of their shares of common stock (1) “FOR” the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and (2) “FOR” the
adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting and have further informed us that they currently
intend to vote (3) “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable by
ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Voting of Proxies

If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you may
cause your shares to be voted by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid envelope, or you may
vote in person at the Special Meeting. Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone by
following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions
on the proxy card, in order to grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone. Based on your proxy cards or
Internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will vote your shares according to your directions.

If you plan to attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the Special Meeting. If
your shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting
in person. If you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any previously submitted
proxy.

Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies
received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the
shareholder. Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted (1) “FOR” approval and
adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special
Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become
payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank,
broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or
attending the Special Meeting and voting in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee. If such a
service is provided, you may vote over the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the
instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not return your bank’s, broker’s or
other nominee’s voting form, do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if
possible, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other
nominee, it will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement
but will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal or the proposal to approve, by

non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in
connection with the Merger.

Revocability of Proxies

If you are a shareholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the
Special Meeting by:
 

•
 

signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
 

•
 

submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 

•
 

delivering a written notice of revocation to ARI’s Secretary; or
 

•
 

attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you have submitted a proxy, your appearance at the Special Meeting, in the absence of voting in person or submitting
an additional proxy or revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal
proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Any adjournment, postponement or other delay of the Special Meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies, will allow shareholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the
Special Meeting as adjourned, postponed or delayed.

Board of Directors’ Recommendation

The Board of Directors, after considering various factors described under the caption “The Merger—Recommendation of
the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable to, fair to and in the best interests of ARI and
shareholders; and (2) adopted and approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the approval and
adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special
Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become
payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Solicitation of Proxies

The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by ARI. We have retained Morrow Sodali LLC, a proxy solicitation firm
(the “Proxy Solicitor”), to solicit proxies in connection with the Special Meeting at a cost of approximately $15,000 plus
expenses. We will also indemnify the Proxy Solicitor against losses arising out of its provisions of these services on our
behalf. In addition, we may reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees representing beneficial owners of shares for their
expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers
and employees, personally or by telephone, email, fax, over the Internet or other means of communication. No additional
compensation will be paid for such services.

2017.

merger under Section 180.1302(1) or Section 180.1302(2) of the WBCL.

Other Matters

At this time, we know of no other matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting. If any other matters properly come

proxy holders.

Householding of Special Meeting Materials

Unless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of this proxy statement to any household at
which two or more shareholders reside if we believe the shareholders are members of the same family. Each shareholder in
the household will continue to receive a separate proxy card. This process, known as “householding,” reduces the volume of
duplicate information received at your household and helps to reduce our expenses.

described below. Similarly, if you share an address with another shareholder and together both of you would like to receive
only a single set of our disclosure documents, follow these instructions.

10850 West Park Place, Suite 1200, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53224 or calling us at (414) 973-4300. Eligible shareholders of
record receiving multiple copies of this proxy statement can request householding by contacting us in the same manner. If a
bank, broker or other nominee holds your shares, please contact your bank, broker or other nominee directly.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

We are asking you to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the Merger Agreement and
the Merger throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the sections captioned “The Merger”
beginning on page 27 of this proxy statement and “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 63 of this proxy statement. A
copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. You are urged to read the Merger Agreement
carefully in its entirety.

Under applicable law, we cannot complete the Merger without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes that holders
of the outstanding shares of ARI common stock at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to cast on the
proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger. If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote, in
person or by proxy, or fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have the
same effect as a vote against the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 2: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or
appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time
of the Special Meeting. If shareholders approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any
adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including proxies from
shareholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies
representing a sufficient number of votes against approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to
approve and adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the
approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to
votes in favor of approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting
if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY, NON-BINDING VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-
binding basis, the payment of certain compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers
in connection with the Merger, as disclosed in the section captioned “The Merger—Interests of ARI’s Directors and Named
Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 51 of this proxy statement.

We are asking shareholders to indicate their approval of the various compensation that will or may become payable by
ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the section captioned
“The Merger—Interests of ARI’s Directors and Named Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 51 of this proxy
statement, and the accompanying footnotes. In general, the various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these
compensation payments may be made have previously formed part of ARI’s overall compensation program for our named
executive officers and previously have been disclosed to shareholders as part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis
and related sections of our annual proxy statements.

25



9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 35/179

 
These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which
is composed solely of non-management directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.

Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting:

“RESOLVED, that the shareholders of ARI Network Services, Inc. approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the
compensation that will or may become payable by ARI to its named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to
the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The Merger—Interests of ARI’s
Directors and Named Executive Officers in the Merger.” ”

Shareholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and as an advisory vote, the
result will not be binding on ARI, the Board of Directors, Parent or the named executive officers. Further, the underlying
plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to shareholder approval. Accordingly,
regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated our named executive officers will be eligible to
receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions
applicable to the underlying plans and agreements and the Merger Agreement.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

 THE MERGER
This discussion of the Merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this

proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should read the entire Merger
Agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the Merger.

ARI common stock is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “ARIS.”

Expedition Holdings LLC
c/o True Wind Capital GP, LLC
480 Pacific Avenue, Suite 200
San Francisco, CA 94133

Expedition Holdings LLC was formed on June 16, 2017, solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and has not engaged in any business activities other than in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and arranging of the equity financing and debt financing in connection
with the Merger.

Expedition Merger Sub, Inc.
c/o True Wind Capital GP, LLC
480 Pacific Avenue, Suite 200
San Francisco, CA 94133

Merger Sub is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and was formed on June 19, 2017, solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and has not engaged in any business activities other than
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and arranging of the equity financing and debt
financing in connection with the Merger.

Parent and Merger Sub are each affiliated with True Wind. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, (1) TWC has provided to Parent an equity commitment of up to $93,341,000; and (2) Parent has obtained
a debt financing commitment from the Lender for an aggregate amount of up to $72.5 million, comprised of a $7.5 million
revolving credit facility, which will be available to fund a portion of the payments contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
and a $55 million to $65 million term loan facility (in each case, pursuant to the terms and conditions as described further
under the caption “The Merger—Financing of the Merger,” beginning on page 56 of this proxy statement). After giving effect
to the Merger, ARI, as the Surviving Corporation, will be affiliated with True Wind.

Effect of the Merger

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub will
merge with and into ARI, and ARI will continue as the Surviving Corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
As a result of the Merger, our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from NASDAQ. In
addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the
SEC. If the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

27



9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 37/179

 
The Effective Time will occur upon the filing of articles of merger with the Wisconsin Department of Financial

Institutions (or at such later time as we, Parent and Merger Sub may agree and specify in the articles of merger).

Effect on ARI if the Merger is Not Completed

If the Merger Agreement is not approved and adopted by shareholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other
reason, shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, ARI will remain an independent
public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act
and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we expect that
shareholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including
risks related to the highly competitive industry in which ARI operates and risks related to adverse economic conditions.

Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be
completed, the price of our common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the
price of our common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on
the future value of your shares of common stock. If the Merger is not completed, the Board of Directors will continue to
evaluate and review ARI’s business operations, strategic direction and capitalization, among other things, and will make such
changes as are deemed appropriate. If the Merger Agreement is not approved and adopted by shareholders or if the Merger is
not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Board of Directors
will be offered or that ARI’s business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.

Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, ARI will be required to pay Parent a
termination fee of $4,767,000. Parent will be required to pay to ARI a reverse termination fee of $8,264,000 if the Merger
Agreement is terminated under different specified circumstances. For more information, please see the section captioned
“The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expense Reimbursement,” beginning on page 81 of this proxy statement.

Merger Consideration

In the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock (other than shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub) will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but you will no
longer have any rights as a shareholder of ARI.

Background of the Merger

As part of its ongoing assessment of ARI’s business, the Board of Directors, together with senior management, regularly
reviews and evaluates ARI’s business strategy, financial performance and business opportunities with a view towards
strengthening ARI’s business and identifying prospects to increase shareholder value. As part of this evaluation, the Board of
Directors has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives for ARI, including transactions and business
combinations (whether structured as a merger, sale of ARI, joint venture or transformative acquisition by ARI). During the
period since ARI’s relisting on NASDAQ in December 2013 and prior to the events described below and the process that
resulted in ARI’s entry into the Merger Agreement, ARI had, from time to time, been involved in preliminary discussions
with multiple potential strategic and financial buyers. In each case, the relevant parties determined not to pursue a transaction.

28



9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 38/179

 During December 2013, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen had a telephonic discussion with representatives from PCS, which
had expressed interest in advising ARI on exploring strategic alternatives.

During January 2015, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen had a telephonic discussion with representatives from an investment
bank (“Investment Bank B”) which had expressed interest in advising ARI on exploring strategic alternatives.

During January 2015, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen gave a presentation to a private equity firm (“Financial Party B”) that
had expressed interest in learning more about ARI. The initial presentation was based solely upon publicly available
information, since the parties had not yet entered into a confidentiality agreement. The parties subsequently entered into a
confidentiality agreement containing standstill provisions on January 20, 2015. The discussions ultimately stalled in 2015, as
Financial Party B wanted access to confidential information, which, based on discussions among ARI’s management and
Board of Directors, ARI determined not to provide in the absence of a formal indication of interest from Financial Party B.

During April 2015, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen met in New York City with representatives of an investment bank
(“Investment Bank C”) interested in advising ARI on pursuing transactions, either from a buy-side or sell-side perspective.

During November 2015, ARI was approached by a strategic party (“Strategic Party C”) expressing interest in learning
more about ARI. The parties executed a confidentiality agreement on November 20, 2015. On November 23, 2015, Mr.
Olivier visited the offices of Strategic Party C to give a presentation on ARI. Subsequent conversations with Strategic Party C
revealed that Strategic Party C had an interest in pursuing a potential transaction with ARI, but not at a premium to ARI’s
then-current trading price. Based on discussions among ARI’s management and Board of Directors, discussions with
Strategic Party C were discontinued.

In light of ARI’s recent growth trajectory and the resulting attention ARI had begun to receive from investment banking
firms and potential investors, management and the Board of Directors began informally discussing ways to explore the range
of potential alternatives available to ARI for maximizing shareholder value.

During an in-person meeting of ARI’s Board of Directors held on January 5, 2016, Mr. Nurthen presented the Board with
background information regarding conducting a formal process to evaluate strategic alternatives and the various steps and
responsibilities of the Board associated with such a process.

During February 2016, at the request of Financial Party B, there was a telephonic meeting between Messrs. Olivier and
Nurthen and representatives of Financial Party B in which Financial Party B expressed interested in restarting conversations
regarding a potential transaction. Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen also held a telephonic meeting with representatives of PCS
who expressed continued interest in advising ARI on exploring strategic alternatives.

During a meeting of ARI’s Board of Directors held on March 9, 2016, Mr. Olivier reported to the Board the ongoing
interest by Financial Party B in potentially pursuing a transaction with the Company. At that same meeting, as part of the
ongoing preliminary discussions regarding potentially exploring alternatives for maximizing shareholder value, Mr. Olivier
presented the Board with a more detailed overview of potential strategic alternatives and the process for further exploring
such alternatives.

In May 2016, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen met telephonically with representatives of Financial Party B to discuss
Financial Party B’s ongoing interest in the Company. Also, during that month, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen met in
Milwaukee with representatives of PCS to revisit discussions regarding the potential for PCS to advise ARI on exploring
strategic alternatives.

During the June 9, 2016 Board of Directors in-person meeting, there was further discussion regarding exploring strategic
alternatives and the Board began discussing and considering the first step towards financial advisor selection. The Board also
determined that, prior to providing additional confidential information to Financial Party B, ARI should request a formal
indication of interest from Financial Party B. On June 29, 2016, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen met with

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 39/179

 
representatives of PCS at their offices in Boston, at which PCS extended an invitation to Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen to
attend PCS’ Global Technology Leadership Forum in August 2016. The Company ultimately determined not to attend the
conference to avoid any appearance that the Company had begun a strategic transaction process.

On July 7, 2016, the Company received a non-binding indication of interest from Financial Party B indicating a potential
acquisition price of $6.49 per share.

On July 13, 2016, the Board assembled telephonically and invited Mark C. Witt and C.J. Wauters of Godfrey & Kahn,
S.C. (“G&K”), ARI’s outside legal counsel, to discuss and answer questions from the Board regarding a process for
evaluating ARI’s long-term strategy and the potential evaluation of strategic alternatives, and the Board’s fiduciary duties in
connection with such a process. During a subsequent telephonic Board meeting on July 20, 2016, Mr. Nurthen presented the
Board with a framework to assist them in evaluating ARI’s long-term risk adjusted stand-alone prospects relative to a
potential transaction offer price.

At an in-person Board meeting held on August 11, 2016, Messrs. Witt and Wauters of G&K provided the Board with
additional detail regarding the legal and practical considerations associated with engaging in a formal process to explore
strategic alternatives for ARI.

During the months of July and August 2016, ARI provided Party B with various due diligence materials, and on August
23, 2016, representatives of Financial Party B conducted an onsite diligence meeting at the Company’s corporate
headquarters with members of the management team. On September 9, 2016, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen visited the offices
of Financial Party B to further evaluate the potential for a possible transaction.

On October 7, 2016, a party purporting to be, along with its affiliates, the beneficial owner of approximately 5.8% of the
outstanding shares of the Company (the “Dissident Shareholder”), filed an amended Schedule 13D with the SEC indicating
that it had submitted a notice to ARI, pursuant to the Company’s by-laws, of its intention to nominate a slate of two directors
for election to three-year terms at the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders to be held in January 2017.

On October 11, 2016, a telephonic Board meeting was held at which the Board was provided with an update on the status
of the ongoing discussions with Financial Party B, as well as an update on the notice recently submitted to the Company by
the Dissident Shareholder. In light of the continuing interest of Financial Party B and the increased attention ARI had recently
received from investment banks and current and potential investors, the Board of Directors determined that it would be
prudent to more formally explore alternatives for maximizing shareholder value. Following the discussion, the Board reached
consensus to select a financial advisor to advise the Company in a process to evaluate strategic alternatives.

On October 26, 2016, the Board met in-person with PCS and Investment Bank B to have them present their
recommendations on strategic alternatives and have an opportunity to discuss their qualifications in facilitating such a
process.

On November 4, 2016, the Board met telephonically with individuals who had recently worked for Investment Bank C,
who had since joined a new firm. These representatives presented, on behalf of their new firm, recommendations on strategic
alternatives to the Board along with the representatives’ and their firm’s qualifications in facilitating a process.

On November 11, 2016, the Board reconvened telephonically to discuss the three financial advisors that they had
interviewed and determined that PCS would be the best partner to advise ARI on the exploration of strategic alternatives.
Each of the potential financial advisors interviewed by the Board, as part of its presentation to the Board, responded to a
questionnaire provided in advance by ARI inquiring as to, among other items, the firm’s relevant experience and any prior
relationships with ARI, its management, Board of Directors or advisors. The Board concluded that it would be in the best
interest of ARI’s shareholders for ARI to conduct a robust process for exploring strategic alternatives, and authorized senior
management to move forward with the negotiation of an engagement letter and fee structures with PCS. The Board selected
PCS to act as its financial advisor based on PCS’ qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business and
affairs of ARI and the industry in which ARI operates and lack of conflicts of interest.

The Board also noted that each of the three finalist financial advisors had demonstrated experience with software companies
in related vertical markets, but that PCS had recent experience selling software companies in ARI’s specific business space.

Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen met with representatives of PCS in Milwaukee on November 21, 2016 to discuss the
initiation of and strategic approach to the strategic alternatives exploration process. Negotiations regarding the formal legal
terms of the engagement with PCS continued until the parties executed an engagement letter on December 5, 2016.

During the period from November 21, 2016 through February 16, 2017, the Company and PCS held several meetings
and worked to draft marketing materials including, but not limited to, anonymous “teaser” materials, non-disclosure
agreements, a confidential information memorandum (“CIM”), presentations for introductory meetings, management meeting
presentations and financial forecasts. Drafts of these materials were presented to the Board during their January 5, 2017
meeting for their review and comment.

On January 5, 2017, the Company conducted its annual meeting of shareholders at which ARI’s shareholders voted to
elect the two directors nominated by the Company, concluding the proxy contest initiated by the Dissident Shareholder.

On January 6, 2017, representatives of PCS, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen, Robert Jones, ARI’s Vice President of Sales,
Robert Ostermann, ARI’s Chief Technology Officer, and two other ARI employees met at the Company’s headquarters in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin to conduct a detailed working session relating to the CIM.

On January 20, 2017, the Company was informed by PCS that one of the PCS investment bankers working with the
Company was no longer an employee of PCS.

On January 24, 2017, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen had a process status update conference call with a representative from
PCS.

On January 30, 2017, Mr. Nurthen and select members of the Company’s finance team participated in a finance working
session conference call with representatives of PCS.

An internal status update call was held on February 1, 2017 among Messrs. Olivier, Nurthen and representatives of PCS.
Following that call, a detailed sales “go-to-market” conference call was held on February 2, 2017 with Messrs. Jones and
Olivier and representatives of PCS.

Another finance diligence call was held on February 16, 2017 with Mr. Nurthen, select members of the Company’s
finance team and representatives from PCS.

Beginning on February 16, 2017, consistent with prior discussions with the Board of Directors, PCS and the Company
began contacting potential strategic partners in connection with the process. PCS and the Company collaborated on a list of
the highest probability strategic partners, resulting in a total of 21 potential strategic partners, including Strategic Party C,
with 15 being contacted directly and an additional six contacted through their respective financial sponsors. As a result of this
effort, the Company entered into five non-disclosure agreements, two of which led to half-day management meetings held on
March 28, 2017 and March 30, 2017, respectively.

In parallel, PCS and the Company collaborated on a calling list of financial sponsors based on sponsor criteria, fund size,
software focus, existing portfolio companies and fit with financial profile among other factors. A total of 36 financial
sponsors were contacted, including Financial Party B and TWC. The Company entered into non-disclosure agreements with a
total of 31 potential financial partners (each of which contained standstill provisions), and conducted 23 introductory
meetings or calls beginning on February 28, 2017 through March 9, 2017.

On February 28, 2017 and March 1, 2017, the Company confidentially attended PCS’ Emerging Technology Conference
in San Francisco. At the conference, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen, along with representatives of PCS, conducted meetings
with 18 potential financial buyers all of whom who had previously executed confidentiality agreements with the Company.

On March 3, 2017, the Company received an unsolicited call from an investment bank representing a client on the buy
side (the “Project Apple Party”) to discuss what subsequently became known as Project Apple. The Project Apple Party was
interested in a potential transaction

9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

to acquire certain assets of ARI, but not substantially all of the assets of ARI. A follow-up call was held between Messrs.
Olivier and Nurthen and the banking representatives of the client interested in pursuing Project Apple on March 6, 2017, to
discuss the potential divestiture of certain assets of the Company.

Representatives of PCS attended a meeting of the Company’s Board of Directors on March 8, 2017 to give a full,
detailed update on the process. PCS informed the Board that it had requested that indications of interest (“IOIs”) from
potential buyers be submitted by March 22, 2017. The Board also reviewed draft financial projections prepared by Mr.
Nurthen and the Company’s finance team.

On March 10, 2017, the Company created a virtual data room to provide due diligence materials for potential strategic
and financial buyers.

On March 13 and 16, 2017, the Company and PCS held a process update conference call.
On March 16, 2017, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen conducted an introductory call with TWC.
By March 24, 2017, the Company had received seven IOIs from financial sponsors, including one from TWC.
A telephonic meeting of the Company’s Board of Directors was held on March 27, 2017 at which PCS and management

discussed with the Board the status of the process, including a detailed review of overall process to date and timelines for
next steps in the process. PCS elaborated on the detail of each IOI received, including detailed discussion about the two most
promising participants, Financial Party H (the interest of which was ultimately determined to be contingent on another
transaction they were pursuing) and TWC. PCS recommended that the Company bring three bidders, including TWC,
Financial Party A and Financial Party B, into the next round in the process, with the potential to add a fourth financial
sponsor. In addition, PCS recommended giving the potential strategic buyers additional time to present an IOI to the
Company. After detailed discussion, the Board unanimously agreed to continue moving forward with the next stages of
process after reviewing the IOIs.

On March 28, 2017 and March 30, 2017, the Company conducted two half-day management presentations with potential
strategic buyers, Strategic Party A and Strategic Party B. The Company ultimately did not receive any IOIs from any
potential strategic buyers.

Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen held a process update call with G&K on April 6, 2017.
On April 10, 2017, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen conducted a due diligence conference call with representatives of the

Project Apple Party. On that call, the representatives of the Project Apple Party indicated that they were interested in a limited
subset of ARI’s assets, representing less than 10% of the Company’s revenue. Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen noted that there
might be some complexities in selling such a small portion of the business, which is intricately tied to other parts of the
business, and that in addition to an asset purchase agreement it was likely that a transition agreement would be required to
facilitate the best use of assets between the parties.

From April 11, 2017 through April 27, 2017, representatives of the Company met with representatives of five potential
financial sponsors at the Company’s headquarters, including TWC, Financial Party A, Financial Party B, and two other
potential financial buyers that had submitted IOIs, Financial Party C and Financial Party E.

A telephonic meeting of the Company’s Board of Directors was held on April 18, 2017 at which Mr. Olivier reviewed, at
a high level, the IOIs and responses received from various potential bidders, noting that perhaps four to six parties appeared
to remain as viable potential bidders, all of which were financial, rather than strategic, acquirers. Mr. Oliver also noted that
one of the six parties, Financial Party H, had communicated that its interest was contingent on another transaction they were
pursuing. Mr. Olivier then requested that the Board consider next steps in the process, including whether to move ahead with
the preparation of an auction draft of a merger agreement for distribution to potential bidders in connection with the next
phase of the process.

9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 42/179

 A discussion among the Board members followed regarding the process, including execution risks and market risks and
uncertainties beyond the control of management, such as the potential for general economic slowdown and the risk of
acquisition multiples declining.

After further inquiry of Mr. Olivier regarding the status of the process, the directors continued with a discussion of
several different ways of viewing the Company’s potential valuation, including as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA or as a
multiple of revenues, which would depend to some extent on specific bidders’ views of the current state of the Company and
its potential for growth. Based on an extensive discussion of these topics among all of the directors and additional input from
Mr. Olivier, it was the consensus of the Board that the nature of the IOIs and responses, including preliminary indications
regarding valuation, were sufficient to justify the continuation of the process, including the preparation of an auction draft of
a merger agreement.

Mr. Wauters of G&K discussed with the Board its fiduciary duties and various related factors for consideration. The
Board determined that a careful and ongoing evaluation should be undertaken to determine whether any potential conflicts
might exist, and to continue the discussion based on the results of the evaluation. The Board also determined that given
various factors, including the size of the Board and the absence of conflicts, that it was not necessary at that time to form a
special committee. Following the meeting, each director formally confirmed that no such conflicts existed.

During the following weeks, with substantial input from ARI’s management, representatives of G&K prepared a draft
merger agreement to be submitted to process participants in connection with the next round of bids.

An internal process update call was held between Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen and representatives of PCS on April 25,
2017.

On May 3, 2017 representatives from TWC and PCS returned to the Company’s headquarters to meet with Messrs.
Olivier and Nurthen for a detailed management diligence session as a follow-up to TWC’s review of the due diligence
materials in the data room.

On May 5, 2017, a financial due diligence call was held with representatives from Financial Party B, Mr. Nurthen and a
representative of the Company’s finance team.

On May 8, 2017, a telephonic Board meeting was held to provide an update regarding the process and to discuss
potential next steps. Mr. Olivier noted to the Board that a second member of the PCS team had resigned to join a new firm,
HLC. Mr. Olivier noted that, based on the terms of the engagement letter between the Company and PCS, the departure
triggered a right of the Company to terminate the engagement with PCS. Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen provided the Board
with their perspectives as to how to proceed with the PCS engagement and the process in general. Both stated their opinion
that a continuity plan by which PCS would enter an arrangement with HLC that would allow the former PCS investment
banker to continue working on the project would best ensure a continued sound and thorough process to produce as much
value as possible for the Company’s shareholders. The Board determined that management should work toward a continuity
plan among the Company, PCS and HLC to best leverage the skillsets of and work already performed by both PCS and the
investment banker who had departed PCS to join HLC.

On May 9, 2017, there was a dinner meeting in New York City between Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen and Adam
Clammer and Jamie Greene from TWC. At the dinner, the parties discussed further the potential for a transaction.

On May 10, 2017, Messrs. Olivier, Nurthen and representatives from PCS and TWC held a call to discuss questions
TWC had regarding ARI’s business based upon its review of the due diligence materials in the data room.

Later on May 10, 2017, Messrs. Olivier, and Nurthen held a conference call with representatives of Project Apple to
discuss their continued interest in acquiring certain assets of the Company. During the call, representatives of the Project
Apple Party verbally indicated a purchase price range, subject to further due diligence, that they believed would represent a
fair value for the assets it was interested in acquiring. As a follow-up to this call, Mr. Olivier sent an email to the Company’s
Board of Directors on May 11th, describing the valuation range that was discussed. The Company

also requested that the Project Apple Party provide a non-binding terms sheet documenting the valuation rage and the
contingencies associated with such valuation.

Also on May 10, 2017, it was noted that Financial Party F and Financial Party G had acquired a company (“Company
A”) that ARI and PCS believed could have synergies with ARI. The Company subsequently executed confidentiality
agreements with these parties and granted their representatives access to the data room.

On May 11, 2017, an additional financial due diligence call was conducted with Mr. Nurthen, the Company’s finance
team and representatives of TWC.

On May 15, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Company’s Board of Directors was held to discuss the current status of the
continuity plan of the process, which was discussed and approved in the previous Board meeting, noting that the Company
had executed a non-disclosure agreement with HLC. In parallel, it was noted that PCS had sent an amended engagement
letter to the Company under which PCS proposed to continue to retain, through an arrangement with HLC, the services of the
investment banker who had recently left PCS to join HLC in connection with the Company sale process. The Company, PCS,
and HLC ultimately executed that amendment to the engagement letter on June 19, 2017.

The Board and management also discussed the current status of the Project Apple and the potential Project Apple
transaction relative to the ongoing process, including what would be likely to create the most value for the Company and its
shareholders, taking into account the risks associated with either strategy, and whether and to what extent to formally engage
PCS in connection with the Project Apple discussions. The consensus of the Board was to continue to explore the
possibilities associated with Project Apple while also engaging in hypothetical conversations with the remaining participants
in the ongoing process regarding Project Apple in order to keep both processes moving forward. Following discussion, the
Board authorized the Company to sign a non-binding term sheet with an exclusivity provision with the Project Apple Party,
subject to final negotiation of specific terms and conditions.

On May 16, 2017, representatives of PCS sent a bid process letter and draft form of merger agreement to five parties.
The instructions in the bid process letter provided for, among other things, bidders to provide their best offers, the form of
consideration, their sources of funding, and a comprehensive mark-up reflecting any changes to the draft auction merger
agreement, by May 24, 2017. At the time, representatives of PCS indicated it was their expectation that Financial Party H
would not submit a bid, as their interest in ARI was contingent upon the occurrence of another transaction, which was not
expected to materialize.

On May 17, 2017, representatives of the Project Apple Party sent an initial diligence request list and proposed timeline to
Mr. Olivier. On May 19, representatives of Project Apple sent a non-binding term sheet to Mr. Olivier.

On May 22, 2017, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen held a follow-up conference call with Financial Party B to address its
additional outstanding diligence questions.

Also on May 22, 2017, a telephonic legal due diligence call was held between members of the Company’s executive
team, G&K, TWC, PCS and attendees from Kirkland & Ellis LLP (“K&E”), legal counsel to TWC. PCS offered to schedule
legal due diligence sessions with other process participants, but no other party requested such a session.

On May 23, 2017, a telephonic finance due diligence call was held between TWC and the Company. Later in the day, the
Company also had a conference call with G&K regarding the evaluation of Project Apple concurrently with the ongoing bid
process.

During May 17, 2017, and May 24, 2017, representatives of PCS and HLC contacted Financial Party A and Financial
Party B to inform them that they should only submit a bid letter if their offers would be higher than what was noted in the
IOIs previously submitted by the respective firms.

On May 24, 2017, TWC submitted to the Company a formal bid letter, draft exclusivity agreement, draft debt
commitment letter and a markup of the draft form of merger agreement,

34



9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 44/179

 
representing an offer of $7.10 cash per share. Financial Party A and Financial Party B did not submit a bid and noted their
continued interest, but inability to raise their bids above what they had previously submitted in their respective IOIs.
Financial Party C did not submit a final bid.

On May 25, 2017, the Company issued a press release providing a preliminary view to its earnings for the third quarter
of its fiscal 2017. An update containing the preliminary information had been made available to potential bidders in the
electronic data room on May 12, 2017. The press release was provided in anticipation of Mr. Olivier’s and Mr. Nurthen’s
attendance at the B. Riley Investor Conference in Santa Monica, California.

On May 26, 2017, a telephonic Board meeting was held to discuss the current state of the process, including that a
formal bid was presented to the Company on May 24th by TWC. Messrs. Witt and Wauters of G&K attended the meeting to
advise the Company on various legal matters, next steps and other strategic matters relating to the process and Project Apple.
It was further noted that Financial Party F and Financial Party G, who were the winning bidders in the process to acquire
Company A, Financial Party F and Financial Party G, had executed a non-disclosure agreement with the Company and
indicated some level of interest in the process, but had not responded in any additional detail or provided any indication of
interest.

The Board reviewed a detailed summary of TWC’s bid, which had been prepared by PCS.
During the ensuing discussion, one option presented to the Board was to sign an exclusivity agreement with TWC and

then move forward with negotiating the merger agreement during the exclusivity period. It was noted that, as currently
drafted, the exclusivity agreement proposed by TWC would preclude the Company from pursuing the Project Apple
transaction.

Messrs. Witt and Wauters then discussed with the Board of its fiduciary duties with respect to the strategic alternatives
review process, including the duties of care and loyalty, and reminded the Board of the need to be vigilant regarding any
potential conflicts relating to TWC, and related legal matters. Each Board member again confirmed affirmatively that he was
not aware of any such conflicts.

The Board discussed the risks of continuing to pursue Project Apple, including the possibility that it might ultimately
disrupt the process. The directors considered whether it would be possible, in a short amount of time, to obtain further clarity
as to the true extent any remaining interests on the part of Financial Party F and Financial Party G, including whether there
would be value in delaying exclusivity with TWC to allow management time to potentially meet with their representatives. It
was noted that Financial Party F and Financial Party G were aware of the bid deadline and did not submit a bid. Several
directors expressed an interest as to whether TWC’s bid represented its best and final offer from an economic perspective,
and whether and to what extent the potential Project Apple transaction affected the bid.

After further discussion, the directors concluded that, while they believed that the process had been thorough, Mr.
Olivier, through PCS, should make an effort to determine whether TWC might be willing to increase its bid, and to what
extent TWC considered the potential for the potential Project Apple transaction in preparing its bid. Messrs. Olivier and
Nurthen also agreed to provide the Board with an analysis of the potential shareholder value represented by the TWC
proposal and the potential Project Apple transaction, based on reasonable assumptions as necessary.

Following the meeting, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen requested that a representative of HLC communicate to TWC the
Board’s concerns regarding TWC putting forth their best offer and how Project Apple factored into TWC’s offer, if at all.

On May 27, 2017, Mr. Olivier and Mr. Clammer held a telephonic meeting whereby Mr. Clammer noted that the bid
received had considered Project Apple and represented TWC’s final and best offer.

The Company’s Board of Directors, along with Mr. Nurthen, and Messrs. Witt and Wauters from G&K, held another
telephonic meeting on May 30, 2017. Mr. Olivier updated the Board regarding his and Mr. Nurthen’s conversations with HLC
and Mr. Clammer. Mr. Nurthen presented the Board with an analysis of comparative valuation scenarios of the Company in
its present stand-

9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 45/179

 
alone state, adjusted based on the hypothetical consummation of Project Apple, and based upon TWC’s offer.

At the request of the Chairman, Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen provided their perspectives on the TWC bid. Each of them
expressed confidence in the thoroughness of the process and their belief that the TWC opportunity represented the best
opportunity to maximize value for the Company’s shareholders. Mr. Olivier then discussed concerns about the expectation
expressed by TWC in its bid letter that management would roll over a majority of its equity into the post-merger company,
noting that this expectation potentially posed a risk to the transaction, since the topic had not been discussed with TWC and
in light of the potential complexities associated with such a rollover, which had not yet been explored. Notwithstanding this
matter, Mr. Olivier expressed his belief that the Company should move forward with exclusivity arrangement with TWC, but
attempt to clarify the potential for an equity rollover prior to executing a definitive exclusivity agreement.

After extensive deliberation, the Board concluded that it had thoroughly considered the two strategic alternatives
(continuing as a stand-alone entity and the hypothetical consummation of the Project Apple transaction, subject to its
complexities and execution risk) against the present bid from TWC, and that the TWC bid represented the maximum
potential value for the shareholders. However, the Board indicated a desire for more certainty around the management equity
rollover issue, since it could affect the execution risk of a transaction with TWC, prior to executing an exclusivity agreement
with TWC.

Following the discussion, and with input from Mr. Witt and Mr. Wauters regarding fiduciary and strategic matters, the
Board resolved that, pending reasonable resolution of the management rollover issue, it would be in the best interests of the
Company and shareholders of the Company to enter into an exclusivity agreement with TWC. The Board authorized
management to have discussions with TWC regarding the management rollover issue, and to move forward with TWC in
exclusivity.

On June 1, 2017, Mr. Olivier had a conference call with Mr. Clammer of TWC to discuss, among other things, the
current status of the process as well as additional details regarding TWC’s expectations with respect to the level and scope of
potential management equity rollovers and the potential impact of such rollovers, if any, on the timing and execution of the
proposed merger agreement. As of the date of this proxy statement, ARI’s management has not reached any agreement,
arrangement or understanding with TWC regarding the employment of ARI’s management team following a transaction.

Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen and representatives from PCS, HLC and G&K engaged in a process status update call on
June 6, 2017.

On June 7, 2017, a management discussion was held via conference call with Messrs. Olivier, Jones, Ostermann and
Nurthen of the Company as well as a representative of HLC, representatives of PCS, and representatives of TWC.

An in-person meeting of the Company’s Board of Directors, also attended by Mr. Nurthen, was held on June 7, 2017. Mr.
Olivier discussed with the Board the status of the process, adding that management was continuing to negotiate the terms of
an exclusivity agreement with TWC. It was contemplated that the exclusivity period would run from seven to ten business
days. Mr. Nurthen discussed with the Board the implications entering of an exclusivity agreement with TWC. The Board
ratified management’s continuing work toward a definitive exclusivity agreement with TWC based on the resolution of the
few outstanding issues.

On June 8, 2017, the Company released its third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results and management conducted a call
with investors to comment on the results and respond to questions.

Also on June 8, 2017, representatives of G&K and K&E participated in a conference call to discuss the process for
conducting confirmatory due diligence and negotiating the draft merger agreement and related documents during the term of
the exclusivity period between ARI and TWC.

On June 9, 2017, the Company executed an exclusivity agreement with TWC covering a period of seven business days,
with a potential one-time extension of three business days. During the exclusivity period, numerous diligence requests were
made by TWC and fulfilled by the Company.

 On June 13, 2017, Mr. Nurthen and representatives of PCS had a conference call to discuss the financial model to be
used for the fairness opinion. PCS used a financial model that contained the same financial projections as were provided by
the Company in its CIM issued to potential buyers, with the addition of financial projections for fiscal years 2021 and 2022,
which were extrapolated from the projected fiscal years 2018 through 2020.

Also on June 13, 2017, following several extensive discussions with ARI’s management, G&K sent a revised version of
the draft merger agreement to K&E. G&K also received from K&E drafts of TWC’s equity commitment letter and limited
guaranty.

On June 15, 2017, representatives of G&K and K&E participated in a conference call to discuss a variety of open items
in the draft merger agreement, including proposed termination fees, pre- and post-termination rights and remedies of the
parties and related matters.

On June 16, 2017, G&K sent a proposed markup of the draft equity commitment letter and limited guaranty to K&E.
On June 17, 2017, representatives of G&K and K&E participated in a conference call to further discuss and come to a

tentative resolution on various open issues in the merger agreement, equity commitment letter and limited guaranty. From
June 17, 2017 through June 20, 2017, G&K and K&E also exchanged drafts of ARI’s Disclosure Letter and worked, with
ARI’s management, toward resolving open issues and finalize the Disclosure Letter.

A telephonic meeting of the Board of Directors was held on June 19, 2017, also attended by Mr. Nurthen and
representatives of G&K. The Board discussed the recent increase in trading volume and price of ARI common stock, which
would have the effect of reducing the execution date premium represented by TWC’s offer of $7.10 per share relative to the
60-day premium. The Board ultimately concluded that the recent trading activity could be short-term in nature, and did not
alter the Board’s view as to whether the continued pursuit of the proposed transaction would be in the best interest of
shareholders. The Board also reiterated its belief that the process has been deliberate, robust and responsibly conducted in the
best interests of the Company’s shareholders, determined to seek the input of PCS as to whether the recent trading activity
would in any way affect its ability to render its fairness opinion.

G&K then led a discussion with the Board regarding the status of open items in the draft merger agreement, which
included, among other less significant items, the amounts of the Company and Parent termination fees. G&K informed the
Board that it was not otherwise aware of any open issues in the merger agreement that would likely delay its execution
pending Board approval. Following the discussion, Mr. Olivier provided an update to the Board regarding his preliminary
discussions with TWC relating to TWC’s management equity rollover expectations, describing recent discussions regarding
the potential tax treatment of any such rollovers, which were ongoing but not expected to ultimately impair or delay a
potential merger agreement execution.

Throughout June 19, 2017 and June 20, 2017, G&K and K&E continued to exchange comments and drafts of the merger
agreement and related documents, culminating in the preparation of proposed execution versions in the early evening of June
20, 2017.

A telephonic meeting of ARI’s Board of Directors was held at approximately 5:00 p.m. Central time on June 20, 2017,
which was also attended by representatives of PCS, HLC and G&K. At the meeting, representatives of PCS reviewed PCS’
financial analysis of the $7.10 per share price. The representative from HLC, who had led the process beginning during his
tenure at PCS, described the process, beginning with its inception in November 2016 to its current state, noting the key
milestones.

Members of ARI’s Board of Directors and G&K questioned the representatives from PCS and HLC about a variety of
matters, including their views of the effectiveness of the process, with PCS and HLC noting, based on their professional
judgment and experience, that the process had been robust and competitive.

Following this discussion, representatives of PCS delivered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion that as of June 20,
2017 and based upon and subject to the considerations, limitations and other matters set forth in its written opinion, the $7.10
in cash per share to be paid to the holders of

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 47/179

 
ARI common stock (other than TWC and its affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.

After PCS and HLC exited the meeting, G&K presented the proposed merger agreement summary as previously
provided to the Board, highlighting, among others matters, the nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of the
parties; the covenants to which the Company would be subject to from signing to closing; the non-solicitation provisions to
which the Company would be subject, and the “fiduciary out” provisions that would permit the Board to respond, under
specified conditions, to unsolicited bona fide acquisition proposals prior to the shareholder vote; the opportunities under the
merger agreement for intervening bids; and the termination provisions, effect of termination and specific performance
remedies provided under the merger agreement.

The Chairman of the Board then opened the floor to discussion and questions regarding the terms of the draft merger
agreement, at which point robust discussion ensued regarding the same and G&K responded to several questions from
members of the Board. A discussion also ensued among G&K and members of the Board regarding the draft Limited
Guaranty, and any potential risks associated with enforcing the Limited Guaranty should it become necessary at some point to
do so.

As it related to the tax issue surrounding management’s potential rollover of equity into the new entity, Mr. Olivier noted
that as of yet there had been no specific arrangements made regarding equity rollovers, and no resolution had been reached as
to whether a rollover could or would be structured as a taxable or tax-free transaction.

Messrs. Olivier, Witt and Wauters noted that G&K was still in the final process of reviewing the presumed execution
version of the Merger Agreement, Limited Guaranty and Equity Commitment Letter, and that it would be appropriate to
adjourn the meeting so the documents could be reviewed and circulated to the Board, along with proposed resolutions, prior
to any final determinations by the Board. Mr. Olivier noted that the press release and other communications materials had
been reviewed by the Company, TWC and its counsel, K&E, and by G&K.

Lastly, the Board discussed the fact that the Company’s stock had closed at a price near the proposed per share
consideration, and whether and how that fact affected their views with respect to proceeding with the proposed transaction.
The consensus of the Board was that the trading price on a given day does not accurately speak to the fairness of the proposed
transaction and the recent run-up in price was likely not directly related to the value of the business and that, despite every
effort by the parties to maintain strict confidentiality, it may have been affected by the process. Considering that, the Board
noted that the proposed $7.10 per share price still represented a meaningful premium over the “unaffected” trading price of
the stock. The Board discussed in particular PCS’ stated view that the recent share price activity did not affect its ability to
render the Fairness Opinion.

With no further business to discuss, the Board adjourned at approximately 7:00 p.m. Central time, to reconvene at 10:00
p.m. Central time to continue discussions regarding the proposed transaction.

The Board, Mr. Nurthen, and representatives of G&K reconvened via telephone at approximately 10:00 p.m. Central
time to continue discussions relating to the proposed transaction.

Upon reconvening the meeting, Mr. Olivier provided the other members of the Board with an update on the discussions
between K&E and G&K as to whether a potential management equity rollover could be structured as a tax-free or tax-
deferred transaction. Mr. Olivier and G&K described the potential for a structure that may permit a tax-efficient rollover, and
a minor change that had been made to the draft merger agreement to potentially allow for tax-efficient rollovers. Mr. Olivier
again noted that no definitive arrangements or agreements had been reached regarding any equity rollovers. After discussion,
the Board determined that the issue had been adequately addressed as to significantly mitigate execution risk relating to the
issue.

G&K reminded the Board of its fiduciary duties in connection with the approval of the proposed merger agreement. All
members of the Board renewed their confirmations that no matters

9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

had arisen that could create a conflict or appearance of a conflict in connection with the proposed transaction.

Following this discussion, G&K led a discussion summarizing potential reasons for and against the proposed transaction
that had been discussed by the Board of Directors over the course of the process and the Board’s review of the potential
transaction (see below under the heading “—Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger—
Reasons for the Merger”), and requested input from the Board with respect to the factors.

Prior to the meeting, the Board had been provided with the proposed execution versions of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, Equity Commitment Letter and Limited Guaranty, along with proposed resolutions relating to the transaction. With
no additional questions surrounding the merger documents, the Board paused to review the resolutions relating to the
proposed merger agreement and related matters. The Board then unanimously approved the proposed resolutions as
presented.

Following the Board of Directors meeting on June 20, 2017, the parties executed the Merger Agreement, Equity
Commitment Letter and Limited Guaranty.

The morning of June 21, 2017, prior to the opening of trading of the ARI common stock on NASDAQ, the Company
issued a press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger

Recommendation of the Board of Directors

The Board of Directors has unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable to, fair to and in the best interests of ARI and its
shareholders; and (2) adopted and approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the approval and adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special
Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may
become payable by ARI to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Reasons for the Merger

In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, ARI’s Board of Directors consulted with
outside legal counsel, its financial advisors and ARI’s senior management. In recommending that ARI’s shareholders vote in
favor of approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors considered numerous positive factors
relating to the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including
the following material factors (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
 

•
 

The current and historical financial condition and results of operations of ARI.
 

•
 

The risks associated with ARI’s business (as reflected in the “Risk Factors” section in ARI’s Form 10-K and Form 10-
Q filings with the SEC, as applicable).

 

•
 

The risk-adjusted probabilities associated with achieving ARI’s long-term strategic plan as a stand-alone company, as
compared to the opportunity afforded to ARI’s shareholders via the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

•
 

The alternatives to the Merger and the feasibility, risks and uncertainties associated with each alternative.
 

•
 

The competitive risks to ARI’s business from existing and new entrants to ARI’s industry.

•
 

The financial presentation of PCS, including its opinion, dated June 20, 2017, to the effect that, as of such date and
based on and subject to the matters described in the opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration is fair, from a
financial point of view, to holders of shares of ARI common stock who are entitled to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

 

•
 

The process undertaken by the Board to explore alternatives to the Merger, which included contact with multiple
strategic and financial parties, including TWC, to determine their interest in the transaction.

 

•
 

The fact that the consideration to be received by ARI’s shareholders in the Merger will consist entirely of cash, which
will provide liquidity and certainty of value to shareholders.

 

•
 

The recommendation of ARI’s senior management team in favor of the transaction.
 

•
 

The Board’s belief that the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the parties’ representations, warranties and
covenants and the conditions to their respective obligations, are fair and reasonable.

 

•
 

The Board’s belief that the terms of the Merger Agreement, taken as a whole, provide a significant degree of certainty
that the Merger will be consummated, including the fact that the Merger Agreement contains limited closing
conditions.

 

•
 

TWC has agreed to furnish an equity commitment letter pursuant to which TWC commits to provide the equity
funding to the Parent to enable it to provide the equity financing for the transactions contemplated under the proposed
agreement up to $93,341,000, as well as a fully executed debt commitment letter pursuant to which the Lender
committed to provide debt financing to the Parent for an aggregate amount of up to $72.5 million, comprised of a
$7.5 million revolving credit facility, which will be available to fund a portion of the payments contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, and a $55 million to $65 million term loan facility.

 

•
 

The nature of the financing commitments received by TWC with respect to the Merger, including (i) the conditions to
the obligations of the institutions providing such commitments to fund their commitments and (ii) the identities of
those institutions and their experience in consummating transactions such as those contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

 

•
 

TWC has agreed to deliver a limited guaranty of the Parent’s obligations under the Merger Agreement in favor of ARI.
 

•
 

The terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and the course of negotiation thereof, including:
 

-
 

the closing conditions to the Merger, including the condition that the Merger Agreement is subject to the approval of
ARI’s shareholders;

 

-
 

ARI’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a superior proposal, subject to certain conditions
(including allowing TWC to amend its Merger terms) and the payment to Parent of a termination fee of $4,767,000,
plus reimbursable expenses;

 

-
 

the limitation on ARI’s liability for its failure to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement $4,767,000;
and

 

-
 

the fact that the Parent is required to pay ARI a termination fee of $8,264,000, plus reimbursable expenses, if it fails
to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement, including if it fails to obtain its financing for the Merger.

 

•
 

The fact that resolutions approving the Merger Agreement were unanimously approved by the Board of Directors,
which is comprised of a majority of independent directors who are neither affiliated with TWC nor employees of ARI
or any of its subsidiaries, and which retained and received advice from ARI’s outside legal counsel and financial
advisor in evaluating, negotiating and recommending the terms of the Merger Agreement.

In the course of reaching the determinations and decisions and making the recommendation described above, the Board
of Directors, in consultation with ARI’s senior management, outside legal counsel and financial advisor, considered the risks
and potentially negative factors relating to the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger

Agreement, including the following material factors (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative
importance):
 

•
 

Following the Merger, ARI’s shareholders will cease to participate in any future earnings growth of ARI or benefit
from any future increase in its value.

 

•
 

The relationship of the Per Share Merger Consideration to the unaffected trading price of ARI common stock,
constituting a premium of approximately 33% to ARI’s average closing price for the period of 60 trading days ending
June 20, 2017, the date of the Merger Agreement, as well as ARI’s rising stock price from the date the exclusivity
agreement was entered into to the date of the Merger Agreement.

 

•
 

The perceived risks and benefits of a variety of strategic alternatives for ARI, including but not limited to, discussions
with the Project Apple Party regarding the potential divestiture of certain assets of ARI.

 

•
 

The difficulties and challenges inherent in consummating any merger.
 

•
 

The difficulty TWC would have completing the Merger if the financing described in the equity commitment letter and
debt commitment letter entered into by TWC with the Lender, or an alternative financing, were unavailable.

 

•
 

The risk that the Merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all in the event of a failure of certain
closing conditions, including a failure of TWC to obtain financing for the Merger, which would allow Parent/TWC to
terminate the Merger Agreement after paying a termination fee of $8,264,000.

 

•
 

ARI is not entitled to specific performance if TWC, subject to the certain conditions, is unable to finance the Merger.
Instead, ARI is entitled to the termination fee of $8,264,000.

 

•
 

The possibility that if the Merger is not consummated, ARI would have incurred significant transaction and
opportunity costs.

 

•
 

The restrictions on ARI’s ability to solicit or participate in discussions or negotiations regarding alternative acquisition
proposals, subject to specified exceptions, including providing the Parent the ability, for a limited time period, to
modify the Merger terms in response to the Board’s change in recommendation.

 

•
 

Parent is entitled to ARI’s termination fee if:
 

-
 

the Merger Agreement is terminated because the Board (i) withholds, withdraws, qualifies, amends or modifies (or
publicly proposes or resolves to do so), in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the recommendation by the
Board of the Merger Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approves, recommends or otherwise declares advisable or
proposes or resolve to approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable (publicly or otherwise), any Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) takes any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender
or exchange offer, (iv) fail to publicly reaffirm the recommendation by the Board of the Merger Agreement or the
Merger within ten business days after Parent so requests in writing (it being understood that ARI will not be
obligated to make such reaffirmation on more than one occasion), or (v) fails to include the recommendation by the
Board of the Merger Agreement or the Merger in this proxy statement.

 

-
 

the Merger Agreement is terminated by ARI in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior
Offer in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement; and/or

 

-
 

(A) the Merger Agreement is validly terminated (x) by either party if there is a failure to close within six months of
the signing date or if shareholder approval is not obtained or (y) by Parent if ARI breached or failed to perform any
representation or warranty such that the conditions to ARI’s obligations to effect the Merger cannot be satisfied;
(B) following the execution of the Merger Agreement but prior to the termination as detailed in (A), an Acquisition
Proposal is publicly announced or privately submitted to the Board and not withdrawn; and (C) within a one-year

transaction.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the cash Merger consideration will be taxable to ARI’s shareholders that are
entitled to receive such consideration.

 

•
 

The possible disruption to ARI’s business that might result from the announcement of the Merger, such as litigation,
and the resulting distraction of the attention of ARI’s management.

 

•
 

The restrictions on the conduct of ARI’s business prior to completion of the Merger, which could delay or prevent ARI
from undertaking business opportunities that might arise pending completion of the Merger.

The Board of Directors believed that, overall, the potential benefits of the Merger to ARI’s shareholders outweighed the
risks and uncertainties of the Merger.

The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Board of Directors contains the material factors considered by the
Board of Directors, but is not in any way intended to be exhaustive. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection
with its evaluation of the Merger, the Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise
assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determinations and recommendations. Each member
of the Board of Directors applied his or her own business judgment to the process and may have given different weight to
different factors. The Board of Directors did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor or any
particular aspect of a factor supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Board of Directors based its
recommendation on the totality of the information presented.

Opinion of ARI’s Financial Advisor

ARI retained Pacific Crest Securities, a division of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., to act as financial advisor to the
Board of Directors in connection with a potential transaction such as the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
and to evaluate whether the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of ARI common stock (other
than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. ARI
selected PCS to act as its financial advisor based on PCS’ qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of the business
and affairs of ARI and the industry in which ARI operates. At the meeting of the Board of Directors on June 20, 2017, PCS
rendered its oral opinion, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the considerations, limitations and other matters
set forth in its written opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of ARI common stock
(other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.

The full text of PCS’ written opinion, dated June 20, 2017, is attached hereto as Annex B and is incorporated by
reference herein. The written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by PCS in rendering its opinion. You should read the
written opinion carefully in its entirety. The opinion was provided to the Board of Directors and addresses only, as of the date
of the written opinion, the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to the
holders of shares of ARI common stock (other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and it does
not address any other aspect of the proposed transactions. It does not constitute a recommendation as to how any shareholder
should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter, and does not in any manner address the price at which ARI
common stock will trade at any time. The summary of the written opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the written opinion.

In connection with its opinion, PCS reviewed and analyzed, among other things, the following:
 

•
 

a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated June 19, 2017, which PCS understood to be in substantially final form;
 

•
 

certain publicly available information concerning ARI;

42



9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 52/179

 
 

•
 

certain other internal information, primarily financial in nature, including projections, concerning the business and
operations of ARI furnished to PCS by ARI for purposes of its analysis;

 

•
 

certain publicly available information concerning the trading of, and the trading market for, ARI common stock;
 

•
 

certain publicly available information concerning TWC, an affiliate of Parent, and its financing sources;
 

•
 

certain publicly available information with respect to certain other publicly traded companies that PCS believes to be
comparable to ARI and the trading markets for certain of such other companies’ securities; and

 

•
 

certain publicly available information concerning the nature and terms of certain other transactions that PCS considers
relevant to its inquiry.

PCS also discussed the business, financial condition, operations and prospects of ARI with certain officers and
employees of ARI, as well as other matters it believed relevant to its inquiry. PCS also performed such other financial studies
and analyses and considered such other data and information as PCS deemed appropriate.

In its review and analysis and in arriving at its opinion, PCS assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of
all of the financial and other information provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with PCS or publicly available,
and PCS assumed that the representations and warranties of ARI, Parent and Merger Sub contained in the Merger Agreement
are and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. PCS was not engaged to, and did not independently
attempt to, verify any of such information or its accuracy or completeness. PCS also relied upon the management of ARI as
to the reasonableness and achievability of the financial and operating projections (and the assumptions and bases therefor)
provided to PCS (described below under the caption “—Certain Financial Projections”) (the “Financial Projections”) and,
with the consent of ARI, PCS assumed that the Financial Projections were reasonably prepared on bases that reflect the best
currently available estimates and judgments of management of ARI of the future financial performance of ARI and other
matters covered thereby. PCS was not engaged to assess the reasonableness or achievability of the Financial Projections or
the assumptions on which they were based, and PCS expresses no view as to such projections or assumptions. In addition,
PCS did not conduct a physical inspection, valuation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities of ARI, and PCS was not
furnished with any such inspection, valuation or appraisal. PCS also assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other
consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on ARI or
the Merger that would be meaningful to its analysis.

PCS was neither asked to, nor did PCS, offer any opinion as to the material terms of the Merger Agreement or the form
of the Merger. In rendering its opinion, PCS assumed, with ARI’s consent, that the final executed form of the Merger
Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft that PCS examined, and that the conditions to the Merger
as set forth in the Merger Agreement would be satisfied and that the Merger would be consummated on a timely basis on the
terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without waiver or modification of any term or condition that would be meaningful to
PCS’ analysis.

PCS’ opinion was based on economic and market conditions and other circumstances existing on, and information made
available to PCS as of, June 20, 2017 and does not address any matters subsequent to such date or time period after the
delivery of the opinion. In addition, PCS’ opinion was limited to the fairness, as of the date hereof, from a financial point of
view, of the consideration to be paid to the holders of ARI common stock (other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the
Merger Agreement and does not address ARI’s underlying business decision to engage in the Merger or any other terms of
the Merger or the fairness of the Merger, or any consideration paid in connection therewith, to creditors or other
constituencies of ARI. In addition, PCS did not express any opinion as to the fairness of the Merger or the amount or the
nature of the compensation paid or to be paid to any of the directors, officers or employees of ARI, or class of such persons,
relative

9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

to the consideration to be paid to public shareholders of ARI. PCS did not express any opinion as to the impact of the Merger
on the solvency or viability of ARI, Parent or its affiliates or the ability of ARI, Parent or its affiliates to pay their respective
obligations when they come due. Although subsequent developments may affect PCS’ opinion, PCS does not have any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. PCS’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of PCS.

The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by PCS in connection with its opinion dated June
20, 2017. The analyses and factors described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses
or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process
underlying PCS’ opinion. For purposes of its analyses, PCS used the Financial Projections. Some of the summaries of the
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to
more fully understand the financial analyses used by PCS, the tables must be read together with the full text of each
summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of PCS’
financial analyses.

Selected Companies Analysis

PCS compared selected financial information and public market multiples for ARI with publicly available information
and public market multiples for selected companies. The companies used in this comparison included those companies listed
below, which were selected from publicly traded companies in ARI’s industry by PCS based on its professional judgment and
experience.
 

•
 

Infomedia Ltd.
 

•
 

GoDaddy Inc.
 

•
 

Web.com Group, Inc.
 

•
 

Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc.
 

•
 

MAM Software Group, Inc.
 

•
 

CDK Global, Inc.

For purposes of this analysis, PCS analyzed the ratio of the implied enterprise value (“EV”), which PCS calculated as
equity market capitalization plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents, to actual revenues and adjusted EBITDA (earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of ARI for the 12-month period ended April 30, 2017, of Infomedia Ltd.
for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2016 and of the other selected companies for the 12-month period ended March
31, 2017, which was the latest publicly available data as of June 20, 2017. PCS also analyzed the estimated revenues and
estimated adjusted EBITDA for calendar year 2017 of ARI and each of the selected companies. For purposes of this analysis,
PCS used the latest equity market capitalization data and estimates of revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the selected
companies prepared by equity research analysts that were publicly available as of June 20, 2017. Estimated revenue and
estimated adjusted EBITDA of ARI for calendar year 2017 were based on management’s estimates included in the Financial
Projections. For purposes of this analysis, PCS added back certain non-recurring expenses to estimated adjusted EBITDA for
the fiscal year ending July 31, 2017 that was included in the Financial Projections.

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the selected companies, PCS determined the medians of
EV/revenue and EV/adjusted EBITDA for the selected companies for the 12-month periods ending on the dates indicated
above and for calendar year 2017. Based on the number of fully diluted shares of ARI common stock outstanding (calculated
using the treasury stock method) as of June 13, 2017 as provided by ARI’s management (the latest information available at
the time of calculation), and the medians of EV/revenue and EV/adjusted EBITDA of

No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to ARI. In evaluating the selected companies, PCS

made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the control of ARI, such as the impact of competition on
ARI’s business and the industry in general, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in ARI’s
financial condition and prospects of or the industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as
determining the arithmetic mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.

Premiums Paid Analysis

PCS reviewed publicly available data for acquisitions of U.S. publicly traded companies completed from January 1, 2013
to June 20, 2017 across all industries. PCS reviewed the prices offered by the purchasers and calculated the median of
implied premiums of the offered prices over the historical trading prices of the stock of the targets at multiple points in time
prior to the announcement of the transactions. PCS performed the analysis at multiple points in time prior to the
announcement of the transactions in order to mitigate the effect on the analysis of premiums that could have been affected by
factors such as the public becoming aware of the possibility of a transaction. Based on its professional judgment and
experience, PCS applied the median one-month premium of the completed transactions to the closing price of ARI common
stock on May 19, 2017. This analysis indicated the following implied value per share for ARI common stock:

No company or transaction used in the premiums paid analysis is identical to ARI or the Merger. Accordingly, an
evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations
and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition or other values of the companies or transactions to which ARI and the Merger were compared.

Selected Transactions Analysis

PCS compared seven selected transactions announced between June 2014 and February 2016 involving companies that
PCS selected as being similar to ARI based on its professional judgment and experience. PCS selected the transactions based
on operational, business and industry similarities between the target companies and ARI, size of the transactions, the solution
delivery model of the

For each of the transactions listed above, PCS reviewed, among other things, the implied enterprise value of the target

company as a multiple of its revenue for the 12-month period ended on the last day of the latest fiscal quarter preceding the
announcement date of each listed transaction for which data was publicly available. Based on the analysis of such metrics for
the transactions noted above, PCS determined that the median multiple was 2.6x. PCS applied the median multiple to ARI’s
revenue for the 12-month period ending April 30, 2017 to determine an implied enterprise value of ARI. Based on the
calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a value per share of ARI common stock of $6.70.

No company or transaction used in the selected transactions analysis is identical to ARI or the Merger. In evaluating the
selected transactions, PCS made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, market and financial conditions
and other matters, many of which are beyond ARI’s control, such as the impact of competition on ARI’s business or the
industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in ARI’s financial condition or the
industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate
value of the transactions to which they are being compared. Because of the unique circumstances of each of these
transactions and the proposed transactions, PCS cautioned against placing undue reliance on this information.

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

PCS performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to imply a potential, present value per
share of ARI common stock as of June 20, 2017. This analysis was calculated based on the Financial Projections as follows:
 

•
 

Determining an illustrative enterprise value for ARI by:
 

-
 

the implied net present value of projected future free cash flows of ARI, with free cash flows determined based on
the projected earnings before interest and tax included in the Financial Projections for the years ending July 31,
2018 through July 31, 2022, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, including the impact of
income taxes, adding non-cash expenses comprising depreciation, amortization of intangibles and amortization of
software, and subtracting uses of cash comprising changes in net working capital, capital expenditures and
capitalized software development costs, and discounting the projected free cash flows for those periods to present
value by a discount rate of 13.6% using the mid-year convention, based on an estimated weighted average cost of
capital for ARI; and

 

-
 

the implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of ARI, calculated by multiplying adjusted EBITDA
of ARI for the year ending July 31, 2022 by an exit multiple of 12.0 and discounting the product to present value by
a discount rate of 13.6%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for ARI;

 

•
 

Subtracting projected net debt of ARI as of July 31, 2017, including long-term debt, contingent liabilities and capital
lease obligations; and

 

•
 

Dividing the result by the number of fully diluted shares of ARI common stock outstanding (calculated using the
treasury stock method) as of June 13, 2017, as provided by ARI’s management (the latest information available at the
time of calculation).

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 56/179

 
Based on the calculations described above, this analysis implied a value per share of ARI common stock of $6.72.

Illustrative Leveraged Buyout Analysis

PCS performed a hypothetical leveraged buyout analysis to determine the price at which a financial sponsor might effect
a leveraged buyout of ARI. In preparing this analysis, PCS used projected financial information from the Financial
Projections and added back certain non-recurring expenses to estimated adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ending July 31,
2017 that was included in the Financial Projections. PCS determined an illustrative enterprise value for ARI based on:
 

•
 

a transaction date of July 31, 2017;
 

•
 

a subsequent exit transaction by the financial sponsor at July 31, 2022;
 

•
 

a multiple of 5.1x of total debt to actual adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended April 30, 2017, annualized;
 

•
 

debt financing at a rate of LIBOR plus 600 basis points (with a minimum LIBOR rate of 1.00%), amortizing at a rate
of 1% per year;

 

•
 

an exit multiple of 12.0x projected adjusted EBITDA for the year ended July 31, 2022;
 

•
 

a targeted annualized internal rate of return for the financial sponsor of 17.5%; and
 

•
 

financing fees and transaction expenses of $3.8 million in at entry.

PCS selected the leverage multiple, financing terms, exit multiple, target internal rate of return, and fees and expenses
based upon the application of its professional judgment and experience. From the illustrative enterprise value, PCS subtracted
projected net debt of ARI as of July 31, 2017, including long-term debt, contingent liabilities, capital lease obligations and
the redemption premium payable under ARI’s existing credit facility, and divided the result by the number of fully diluted
shares of ARI common stock outstanding (calculated using the treasury stock method) as of June 13, 2017, as provided by
ARI’s management (the latest information available at the time of calculation).

Based on the calculations described above, this analysis implied a value per share of ARI common stock of $6.92.

Miscellaneous

In connection with the review of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the Board of Directors, PCS
performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a
financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description. In
arriving at its opinion, PCS considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight
to any analysis or factor it considered. PCS believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all
analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In
addition, PCS may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have
deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the valuations resulting from any
particular analysis described above should not be taken to be PCS’ view of the actual value of ARI. In performing its
analyses, PCS made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond ARI’s control. Any estimates contained in PCS’ analyses
are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by such estimates.

PCS conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of ARI common stock (other than Parent and its
affiliates) pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and in connection with the delivery of its opinion to the Board of Directors.

9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 57/179

 
PCS’ opinion and its presentation to the Board of Directors was one of many factors considered by the Board of

Directors in deciding to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Consequently, the
analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Board of Directors with respect to
the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by holders of shares of ARI common stock pursuant to the Merger
Agreement or of whether the Board of Directors would have been willing to agree to different consideration. The Per Share
Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between ARI and Parent and was approved by the
Board of Directors. PCS provided advice to ARI during these negotiations. PCS did not, however, recommend any specific
consideration to ARI or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated December 5, 2016 (the “PCS Engagement Letter”), as amended, PCS provided ARI
with financial advisory services in connection with the proposed transaction for which it will be paid approximately $2.4
million, $50,000 of which was payable in connection with the execution of its engagement letter, $300,000 of which was
payable upon delivery of its opinion, and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, the Closing. ARI
has also agreed to reimburse PCS for its expenses incurred in performing its services. ARI has also agreed to indemnify PCS
and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, partners and controlling persons against certain liabilities and
expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with PCS’ engagement. In a letter agreement dated May 17, 2017, ARI
consented to PCS’ collaborating with HLC, in connection with the engagement under the PCS Engagement Letter, and ARI
agreed to indemnify HLC and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, partners and controlling persons against
certain liabilities and expenses related to, arising out of or in connection with PCS’ engagement. Of the amount paid by ARI
to PCS for financial advisory services in connection with the proposed transaction, PCS will pay approximately $0.6 million
to HLC for its services. Except for the engagement of PCS and HLC in connection with the Merger, neither ARI nor its
affiliates have had any material relationships with PCS and HLC during the past two years preceding the date of PCS’
opinion described herein.

Certain Financial Projections

While ARI has from time to time provided limited financial guidance in its regular earnings press releases and other
investor materials, which may have covered, among other items, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, ARI’s
management has not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclosed projections or internal projections as to future
performance, earnings or other results due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates.

In connection with the Board of Directors’ review of potential strategic alternatives and its evaluation of a potential sale
transaction, ARI’s management team prepared estimates and projections of ARI’s financial performance for the fiscal years
2017 through 2022 (the “Financial Projections”). ARI prepared the Financial Projections in a manner consistent with the
methodology it uses to prepare its internal budgets in the ordinary course, which does not account for any potential future
acquisitions. The Financial Projections for fiscal years through 2020 were prepared to assist potential buyers participating in
the process in valuing the Company. Management prepared the financial projections for fiscal years 2021 to 2022 for use by
PCS based on straight-line extrapolation from the projected fiscal years 2018 through 2020. The Board of Directors reviewed
the Financial Projections, and management provided the Financial Projections to PCS and HLC, and (for fiscal years through
2020) to potential buyers, including TWC. In addition, PCS used the Financial Projections in connection with performing its
financial analyses and rendering its fairness opinion to the Board of Directors as described above under “—Opinion of ARI’s
Financial Advisor.”

The Financial Projections were prepared on a different basis, for a different purpose, and at a different time from ARI’s
public guidance as to its projected financial and operational results and on a different basis, for a different purpose and at a
different time from any other internal financial projections that ARI’s management may prepare or have prepared for its own
use or for the use of

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 58/179

 
the Board of Directors in evaluating ARI’s business. As a consequence, the Financial Projections do not, and were not
intended to, correspond to ARI’s public guidance as to its projected financial and operational results for the upcoming fiscal
year or fiscal quarter, and do not, and were not intended to, update or revise ARI’s public guidance as to its projected
financial and operational results for the upcoming fiscal year or fiscal quarter.

A summary of the Financial Projections is set forth below. ARI uses EBIT, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, financial
measures that are not in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental measures to evaluate its operational performance. While
ARI believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information, there are limitations
associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. The summary of the Financial Projections contains
reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in
accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are not reported by all of ARI’s competitors and may not be
directly comparable to similarly titled measures of such competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of
calculation. Please read carefully “—Important Information About the Financial Projections” below.

Important Information About the Financial Projections

While the Financial Projections summarized above were prepared in good faith and based on information available at the
time of preparation, no assurance can be made regarding future events. The estimates and assumptions underlying the
Financial Projections involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and
financial market conditions and future business decisions that may not be realized and that are inherently subject to
significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, including, among others, risks
and uncertainties described under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”
and information in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our most recent filings on Form 10-K
and Form 10-Q, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of ARI. There can be no
assurance that the underlying assumptions will prove to be accurate or that the projected results will be realized, and actual
results will likely differ, and may differ materially, from those reflected in the Financial Projections, whether or not the
transaction is completed. As a result, the Financial Projections cannot be considered a reliable predictor of future operating
results, and this information should not be relied on as such.

The Financial Projections were not created with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with
the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
prospective financial data, published guidelines of the SEC regarding forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP
measures or GAAP. In the view of ARI management, each set of projections prepared by them was prepared on a reasonable
basis based on the best information available to ARI management at the time of preparation taking into account the
assumptions underlying the relevant alternative scenario for such Financial Projections. The Financial Projections, however,
are not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results of ARI, and readers of this proxy
statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information. The inclusion of the Financial Projections in this
proxy statement shall not be deemed an admission or representation by ARI that such information is material. None of the
Financial Projections reflects any impact of the Merger.

Neither ARI’s independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants has examined,
compiled or otherwise performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained in the
Financial Projections and, accordingly, no independent registered public accounting firm has expressed any opinion or given
any other form of assurance with respect thereto and no independent registered public accounting firm assumes any
responsibility for the prospective financial information.

Neither ARI nor any of its representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the ultimate

performance of ARI compared to the Financial Projections. The Financial Projections cover multiple years, and such
information by its nature becomes subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. ARI does not undertake any
obligation, except as required by law, to update or otherwise revise the Financial Projections contained in this proxy
statement to reflect circumstances existing since their preparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or to
reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are
shown to be in error.

The summary of the Financial Projections is not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any ARI shareholder
to vote in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the Special
Meeting.

Interests of ARI’s Directors and Named Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to approve and
adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and named executive officers have interests in the
Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of shareholders generally, as more fully described below. The
Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other
matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and recommending that the Merger Agreement be approved and
adopted by shareholders.

Treatment of Equity-Based Awards

Treatment of Stock Options in the Merger

As of July 11, 2017, there were 679,001 outstanding options to acquire ARI common stock of which 100% were “in-the-
money,” that is with an exercise price less than $7.10 per share. ARI’s directors and named executive officers hold 603,500
“in-the-money” options. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option, whether or not vested, will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable tax withholding) equal to the product of (1)
the total number of shares of common stock subject to such outstanding option as of the Effective Time; and (2) the amount,
if any, by which $7.10 exceeds the exercise price per share applicable to such outstanding option.

Treatment of Restricted Shares and RSUs in the Merger

As of July 11, 2017, there were 173,186 outstanding restricted shares and 4,000 RSUs (rights to receive ARI shares),
133,374 of these restricted shares of which were held by our directors and named executive officers. As of the Effective
Time, each outstanding restricted share and RSU will vest in full and become free of restrictions and be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable tax withholding) equal to the product of (1) the total number of
shares of common stock subject to such award of restricted shares or RSUs as of the Effective Time; and (2) $7.10.

Treatment of Performance Restricted Stock in the Merger

As of July 11, 2017, there were 308,000 outstanding performance restricted shares (rights to receive ARI shares),
231,000 of which were held by our named executive officers. The performance restricted shares generally vest at varying
percentages when the 30-day volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) per share reaches $7.00, $8.00, and $9.00,
respectively. Upon a “change of control,” which the consummation of the Merger will constitute, the Merger Consideration
will be substituted for the 30-day VWAP and the number of shares that vest at the price threshold below (which have not
already vested) and immediately above the Per Share Merger Consideration will vest. As of the Effective Time, each
outstanding performance restricted share that vests in accordance with such terms shall become free of restrictions and be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash

(subject to any applicable tax withholding) equal to the product of (1) the total number of performance restricted shares of
common stock subject to such award of restricted shares as of the Effective Time; and (2) $7.10. All unvested performance
restricted shares as of the Effective Time shall be forfeited. Based on the Merger Consideration, 132,000 of these outstanding
performance restricted shares held by our named executive officers will vest as of the Effective Time (or earlier, if the VWAP
reaches $7.00 prior to the Effective Time) and the remaining 99,000 held by them shall be forfeited.

Director Equity Awards

Non-employee members of the Board of Directors receive equity awards in consideration of their service on the Board of
Directors. All such awards will vest in full as of the Effective Time and all outstanding options and restricted shares will be
cancelled or converted and paid out as described above. The non-employee members of the Board of Directors will be
entitled to receive $789,420 in respect of such awards (based on the $7.10 merger consideration and the awards outstanding
as of July 11, 2017).

Equity Interests of ARI’s Executive Officers and Non-Employee Directors

The following table sets forth the number of shares of common stock and the number of shares of common stock
underlying equity awards (both vested and unvested) that are in-the-money (at the $7.10 Per Share Merger Consideration in
the case of options) and are currently held by each of ARI’s named executive officers and non-employee directors, in each
case that either are currently vested or that will or may vest in connection with the Merger, assuming that the Effective Time
occurs on July 11, 2017. The table also sets forth the values of these shares and equity awards based on the $7.10 Per Share
Merger Consideration (minus the applicable exercise price for the in-the-money options). No new shares of common stock or
equity awards were granted to any named executive officer or non-employee director in contemplation of the Merger.

Employment Agreements

ARI has entered into employment agreements with each of its named executive officers. For Mr. Olivier, if Mr. Olivier’s
employment is terminated by ARI other than due to cause, or if he terminates for “good reason” as of the Effective Time,
ARI will pay Mr. Olivier his base salary for 24 months following his date of termination and a bonus equal to the average of
his annual bonus for the three fiscal years ending prior to the effective date of the termination. For Mr. Nurthen, if Mr.
Nurthen’s employment is terminated by ARI other than due to “cause,” or if he terminates for “good reason” as of the
Effective Time, ARI will pay Mr. Nurthen his base salary for nine months following his date of termination and a prorated
bonus payment. For Mr. Ostermann, if Mr. Ostermann’s employment is terminated by ARI other than due to “cause,” or if he
terminates for “good reason” as of the Effective Time, ARI will pay Mr. Ostermann his base salary for six months following
his date of termination and a prorated bonus payment.

“Cause” and “good reason” have the meaning set forth in each named executive officer’s individual employment
agreement.

Change of Control Agreements

ARI has entered into Change of Control Agreements with Mr. Olivier and Mr. Nurthen, which generally provide certain
severance payments and benefits (described below) in the event of a qualifying termination of the employment during the 24-
month period immediately following a change in control of ARI (which will occur upon the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement). Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen are entitled to the greater of the severance provided
under the Change of Control Agreements or under the officer’s employment agreement. In each case, the benefits under the
Change of Control Agreements are greater than the named executive officers’ employment agreement. Under the Change of
Control Agreements, if Messrs. Olivier’s and Nurthen’s employment is terminated without “cause” or due to “good reason”
within the 24 months following the Merger each named executive officer will receive severance benefits equal to two times
the sum of salary and targeted bonuses and medical and dental plan continuation for two years. In addition, each of Messrs.
Olivier and Nurthen will receive a prorated portion of his average annual bonus for the preceding three fiscal years. The
severance amounts for the named executive officers are set forth below in the “Golden Parachute Compensation” section of
this proxy statement.

For purposes of the Change of Control Agreements, “cause” means (i) the willful and continued failure by the named
executive officer to substantially perform his duties with ARI (other than any such failure resulting from the his incapacity
due to physical or mental illness) for a period of at least ten days after a written demand for substantial performance is
delivered to the named executive officer which specifically identifies the manner in which he has not substantially performed
his duties, or (ii) the willful engaging by the named executive officer in misconduct which is demonstrably and materially
injurious to ARI, monetarily or otherwise. For purposes of the Change of Control Agreements, no act or failure to act on the
named executive officer’s part shall be considered “willful” unless done or omitted to be done by the named executive officer
not in good faith and without reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interest of ARI. “Good reason”
for purposes of the Change of Control Agreements means (i) a material diminution of or interference with the officer’s duties
and responsibilities; (ii) a change in the principal workplace of the officer to a location outside of a 50-mile radius from
Milwaukee, Wisconsin; (iii) a reduction or adverse change in the salary, bonus, perquisites, benefits, contingent benefits or
vacation time previously provided to the officer; or (iv) an unreasonable increase in the workload of the officer.

Merger-Related Payment

ARI has allocated an aggregate pool of $150,000 to pay bonuses to certain officers and employees, which may include
some or all of our named executive officers, in recognition of their extraordinary efforts in connection with the Merger,
contingent upon the consummation of the

Merger. No specific payment amounts have been allocated to any individual under the pool as of the date of this proxy
statement.

Golden Parachute Compensation

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger that will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers in connection with
the Merger. Please see the previous portions of this section for further information regarding this compensation. The amounts
indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable assuming, solely for purposes of this table,
that the Merger was consummated on July 11, 2017, and that the employment of each of the named executive officers was
immediately terminated other than for cause on that date. ARI’s executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified
deferred compensation, tax reimbursement or other benefits in connection with the Merger. Some of the amounts set forth in
the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the Merger. In addition to the assumptions regarding the
consummation date of the Merger and the termination of employment, these estimates are based on certain other assumptions
that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table below. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named
executive officer in connection with the Merger may differ from the amounts set forth below.

This amount represents the “double-trigger” cash severance payments to which Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen may become
entitled under the Change of Control Agreements and the cash severance payments Mr. Ostermann is entitled to under
employment agreement upon termination. Under the Change of Control Agreements and Mr. Ostermann’s employment
agreement, the amounts become payable in the event that the employment of the applicable named executive officer is
terminated without cause or for good reason. For Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen this amount represents two years’ of base
salary and target bonus and a prorated portion of the officer’s average annual bonus for the preceding three fiscal years
(offset by any quarterly bonus payments already made toward the fiscal 2017 bonus). For Mr. Ostermann, this amount
represents six months of base salary continuation and a prorated bonus payment (also offset by any quarterly bonus
payments already made toward his fiscal 2017 bonus). For Mr. Olivier, this is equal to two times his $340,000 base salary
plus two times his $190,000 target bonus, plus a prorated average annual bonus payment of $150,453, offset by $142,500
in quarterly bonus payments made to him already in fiscal 2017. For Mr. Nurthen, this equals two times his $251,250
base salary plus two times his $83,750 target bonus, plus a prorated average annual bonus payment of $78,663, offset by
$62,812.50 in quarterly bonus payments made to him already in fiscal 2017. For Mr. Ostermann, this amount represents
six months of base salary continuation ($110,000) and a prorated target bonus payment of $61,260, offset by $48,750 in
quarterly bonus payments made to him already in fiscal 2017.

 

(2)
 

This amount includes the product of (a) $7.10 per share multiplied by (b) the number of shares subject to each named
executive officer’s unvested restricted shares as of July 11, 2017. The total amount for each named executive officer is as
follows: Mr. Olivier $380,993, Mr. Nurthen $147,460, and Mr. Ostermann $92,392. A portion of these shares, with
respect to each executive, are currently scheduled to vest on August 1, 2017.

 

(3)
 

This amount includes the cancellation and cashout of the named executive officers’ options, whether vested or unvested
as of July 11, 2017 to purchase ARI common stock in connection with the Merger. All options are “in-the-money” and
each named executive officer upon the

    options being cancelled and cashed out will receive the following amounts: Mr. Olivier $2,052,500, Mr. Nurthen
$288,750, and Mr. Ostermann $265,189. Of these amounts, the following represents the value of the unvested options:
Mr. Olivier $95,000, Mr. Nurthen $72,188, and Mr. Ostermann $0.

 

(4)
 

This amount includes the product of (a) $7.10 per share multiplied by (b) the number of shares subject to each named
executive officer’s unvested performance restricted shares held as of July 11, 2017 that are expected to vest prior to or as
of the Effective Time based on Per Share Merger Consideration equal to $7.10 (44,000 each). The total amount for each
named executive officer is $312,400.

 

(5)
 

This amount equals the estimated value of the “double-trigger” COBRA benefits to which Messrs. Olivier and Nurthen
may become entitled under the Change of Control Agreements. These COBRA benefits are payable for the 24-month
period following the applicable named executive officer’s termination in the same circumstances described in footnote 1.

The payments and benefits described above that are or may be payable to our executive officers in connection with the
Merger could be subject to decrease (but not increase) in the event that it is determined that (i) the payment of the full amount
of such payments and benefits would subject the executive officer to “golden parachute” excise taxes and (ii) a reduction in
such payments and benefits would result in the executive being in a better after-tax position than the executive would be in if
the full amount of payments and benefits were received. In the event a reduction of payments and benefits is applied, it would
be the minimum reduction necessary so that the executive officer would not be subject to such “golden parachute” excise
taxes.

Indemnification and Insurance of Directors and Officers

After the Effective Time, Parent will cause all rights to exculpation, indemnification and reimbursement and
advancement of expenses from liabilities, and all limitations of liability, existing in favor of any current and former directors
or officers or member of the board of directors or board of managers (or comparable governing body) of ARI or any of its
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Covered Persons”) as provided in their respective governing or organizational documents and
any indemnification or other similar agreements of ARI or any of its subsidiaries in effect as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement and will
continue in full force and effect. All such rights of exculpation, indemnification and reimbursement and advancement of
expenses from liabilities, and all limitations of liability, will not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Covered Person without the consent of such affected Covered Person. From and after the Effective Time, Parent,
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will pay all costs and expenses to any Covered Person, as incurred in connection
with enforcing the exculpation, indemnity, reimbursement, advancement, limitations or other rights or obligations.

At the Effective Time, Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to obtain, maintain and
fully pay for irrevocable “tail” officers’ and directors’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policies naming the
Covered Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six years after the Effective Time with respect to acts
or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date. The insurance policies will contain coverage terms and be in an
amount not less favorable than the Covered Persons’ coverage currently maintained by ARI and will be reviewed and
approved in advance by ARI. In satisfying these obligations, the Surviving Corporation is not obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by ARI for coverage in ARI’s fiscal 2016.

If the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain such insurance coverage, it will obtain the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding 300% of the amount paid by ARI in fiscal 2016 from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating than ARI’s current insurance carrier. In the event a Covered Person is entitled to coverage under this “tail”
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy and such policy has lapsed,
terminated, been repudiated or is otherwise in breach or default as a result of the Parent’s or Surviving Corporation’s failure
to maintain and fulfill its obligations thereunder, Parent will or will

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 65/179

 
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Covered Person such amounts and provide any other coverage or benefits as the
Covered Persons would have received pursuant to this policy.

In any proceeding arising before, at or after the Effective Time where a Covered Person would be entitled to rights of
exculpation, indemnification, reimbursement and advancement of expenses and any limitations on liability under the
applicable governing or organizational documents and any indemnification or other similar agreements of ARI, is made on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions and benefits related to indemnification and insurance of
the Covered Persons will continue in full effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation. For more information, see the section captioned “The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance,”
beginning on page 78 of this proxy statement.

Executive Officers Following the Merger

As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers has entered into any new agreement or arrangement
with ARI, TWC or any of their affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of,
the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to or following the closing of the Merger, however, certain of
our executive officers have had and may continue to have discussions, or may enter into agreements with, Parent or Merger
Sub or their respective affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the
Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates.

During the one-year period following the Closing Date, Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
ARI’s employees so long as they continue to be employed by the Surviving Corporation substantially comparable or greater
base salary and substantially comparable target annual bonus opportunity (excluding cash long-term incentives and other
broad-based equity-based incentive opportunities) to what is currently paid, as well as with respect to each employee
substantially comparable or greater, in the aggregate, compensation and employee benefits (excluding deferred compensation
and cash long-term incentive and equity-based incentive opportunities) to what is currently provided. As of the Closing Date,
the Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with all terms of all ARI employment agreements covering
ARI employees. For the purposes of this section, “ARI employee” means an employee of ARI immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

During the one-year period following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation will provide each ARI employee
whose employment is involuntarily terminated (other than for cause) with severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance benefits such employee would have received with respect to termination following ARI’s severance practices
and employment agreements covering ARI employees as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

The Parent will or will cause the Surviving Company to give ARI employees credit for the purposes of eligibility and
vesting (other than vesting of future equity awards) and for purposes of determining future vacation accruals and severance
amounts under any benefits plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in which such employee participates to
the same extent and for the same purpose as recognized by ARI. Such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition is a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

Financing of the Merger

We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the Merger and the related transactions will be approximately $140
million. This amount includes funds needed to (i) pay our shareholders the amounts due to them under the Merger
Agreement, (ii) make payments due as of the Effective Time in respect of our outstanding equity-based awards pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, and (iii) pay all fees and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement
and Parent’s and Merger Sub’s agreement with the Lender. These payments are expected to be funded through a combination
of (i) equity financing of $93,341,000, and (ii) borrowings under a senior credit facility of up to $72.5 million.

Equity Financing

On June 20, 2017, Parent entered into an equity commitment letter (the “Equity Commitment Letter”) with TWC,
pursuant to which TWC has committed to contribute to Parent cash in an amount up to $93,341,000 at or prior to the Closing,
directly or indirectly through one or more of TWC’s affiliated funds, subject to certain closing conditions, including the
availability of the debt financing described below and the contemporaneous completion of the Merger. The Equity
Commitment Letter provides, among other things, that ARI is an express third party beneficiary of the commitment in
connection with ARI’s exercise of its rights related to specific performance under the Merger Agreement. The Equity
Commitment Letter may not be waived, amended or modified except by an instrument in writing signed by ARI, TWC and
Parent. TWC’s obligation to fund its commitment will terminate on the earliest to occur of (i) the Effective Time, (ii) valid
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (iii) the date on which any claim (other than those
specifically excepted) is brought or action is initiated against TWC by ARI under the Equity Commitment Letter, the Merger
Agreement or any transaction contemplated by those agreements, and (iv) ARI or any of its affiliates or related persons seeks
to impose liability on TWC or any related party of the Parent in excess of $8,264,000 or any other limit on the liability of
TWC under the Equity Commitment Letter or the Merger Agreement. TWC may assign any portion of its commitment to one
or more of its affiliates, financing sources or other investors.

Debt Financing

Merger Sub (referred to as the “Borrower” in connection with the debt financing) and Parent have entered into a debt
commitment letter with the Lender dated as of June 20, 2107 (the “Debt Commitment Letter”). Pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Lender has committed to provide to the Borrower a senior secured credit facility (the “Senior Credit
Facility”). The Senior Credit Facility will consist of (i) a term loan of up to $55 million to $65 million, and (ii) a $7.5 million
revolving credit facility. The Senior Credit Facility will be used to (i) finance a portion of the payments contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, (ii) finance working capital and general corporate purposes of ARI, and (iii) pay fees and expenses
associated with the Merger and related transactions. All obligations under the Senior Credit Facility will be unconditionally
guaranteed by Parent and, with limited exceptions, each of Parent’s existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or
indirect subsidiaries.

The Lender will also serve as administrative agent and collateral agent in connection with the Senior Credit Facility and
we refer to the Lender in those capacities as the agent (the “Agent”). Agent may select another entity to serve as
administrative agent or collateral agent. The Lender will also act as sole lead arranger in connection with the Senior Credit
Facility and, under certain circumstances, may arrange for one or more banks, financial institutions or other institutional
lenders to co-invest with respect to any portion of the Lender’s commitment under the Debt Commitment Letter.

If the Borrower submits a written request to the Agent, the Borrower may increase the size of the term loan and/or add
one or more incremental term loan facilities, subject to certain conditions and limitations, including a limitation of $25
million of aggregate principal amount of all incremental term loan facilities and the satisfaction of a leverage ratio test.

The Senior Credit Facility will close on the date on which (i) the Senior Credit Facility loan documents have been
executed by all parties, (ii) the borrowings under the term loan are made, and (iii) all applicable conditions precedent in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Senior Credit Facility loan documents have been satisfied or waived by the Lender. The
maturity date of the Senior Credit Facility will be the five-year anniversary of the Closing Date.

The availability of the Senior Credit Facility is subject to the following conditions, among others:
 

•
 

the Merger shall have been completed in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement substantially
concurrently with the initial funding under the Senior Credit Facility (without giving effect to any material waiver,
modification, supplement or amendment to the Merger

•
 

the terms of an equity contribution and related agreements shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Lender;

have been terminated, and all liens or security interests related to the indebtedness shall have been terminated or
released;

 

•
 

the Lender shall have received (i) unqualified audited financial statements of ARI for each of the three fiscal years
ending more than 90 days prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) unaudited financial statements for any quarterly interim
period or periods of ARI ending more than 45 days prior to the Closing Date, together with unaudited financial
statements for the corresponding period of the prior year;

 

•
 

at the time of funding, the total amount of indebtedness shall be limited such that the ratio of (a) total indebtedness of
the Borrower and its subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the Merger, to (b) consolidated adjusted
LTM EBITDA (described below under the caption “—Certain Financial Projections”) will not be greater than
6.50:1.00;

 

•
 

all reasonable costs, fees, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses) and other
compensation contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the related fee letter payable to the Agent or the
Lender shall have been paid to the extent due, the Borrower shall have complied with all of its obligations under the
related fee letter, and the Borrower shall have caused ARI to become liable in all respects with all of its obligations
under the Debt Commitment Letter and the related fee letter, effective upon the completion of the Merger on the
Closing Date; and

 

•
 

all definitive documentation shall have been executed and delivery of certain customary closing documents (including,
among others, customary closing certificates, customary legal opinions and information required under anti-money
laundering rules and regulations) will have been completed in accordance with the documentations principles set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter.

The commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter are made to the Borrower and may not be assigned by the
Borrower without the prior written consent of the Lender. The Lender may assign its commitments and agreements under the
Debt Commitment Letter, in whole or in part, to any of its affiliates, provided that no assignment may release the Lender of
its obligations to make available its entire commitment under the Debt Commitment Letter if an assignee fails to do so on the
Closing Date. Subject to certain limitations, other lenders, if any, may assign all or part of their loans and commitments under
the Senior Credit Facility to (i) an affiliate of another lender, (ii) an approved fund, or (iii) one or more banks, financial
institutions or other entities that are eligible assignees under the loan documents executed in connection the Senior Credit
Facility and are reasonably acceptable to the Lender and the Borrower.

The commitment of the Lender will terminate upon the first to occur of (i) the consummation of the Merger, (ii) the
abandonment or termination of the definitive documentation for the Merger, including the Merger Agreement, (iii) a material
breach by the Borrower or a failure of a condition of the Debt Commitment Letter or the related fee letter, and (iv) December
20, 2017, unless the closing of the Senior Credit Facility has been completed on or before that date on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that are relevant
to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of common stock whose shares are converted into
the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”), and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of
which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect.

This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). This discussion does not describe any of the tax
consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign tax jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S.
federal tax law other than income taxation (such as estate or gift taxation, the alternative minimum tax, or the Medicare net
investment income surtax) that may be relevant or applicable to a particular holder in connection with the Merger. For
purposes of this discussion, a “holder” means either a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S. Holder (each as defined below) or both, as
the context may require.

This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to
holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
 

•
 

holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as banks or other financial
institutions; tax-exempt organizations; partnerships or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for
U.S. federal income tax purposes (or an investor in a partnership); retirement or other tax deferred accounts; S
corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(or an investor in a S-corporation or other pass-through entity); insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in stocks
and securities; traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities;
regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; or
certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; or, except as noted below, holders that own or have
owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) five percent or more of ARI’s common stock (by vote or value);

 

•
 

holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reduction
transaction;

 

•
 

tax consequences to holders whose shares constitute qualified small business stock within the meaning of Section 1202
of the Code;

 

•
 

holders that received their shares of common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax qualified retirement
plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;

 

•
 

holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the
Merger;

 

•
 

U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or
 

•
 

holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located,
organized or resident outside the United States.

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will
generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding
shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger.

No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger
described below. No assurance can be given that the IRS will agree

with the views expressed in this discussion, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS
CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND OTHER RELEVANT TAX CONSEQUENCES
RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY
CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAXING
JURISDICTION.

U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S. federal
income tax purposes:
 

•
 

a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
 

•
 

a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or
any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

 

•
 

an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 

•
 

a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more
United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid election in effect under
applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered
pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the
shares, as adjusted for certain corporate actions. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital
gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the
Merger. Such gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is one
year or less at the time of the completion of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term
capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). There are limitations on the deductibility of capital
losses. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder
must determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss separately with respect to each block of common stock.

A U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding in connection with the Merger. Certain
U.S. Holders are exempt from backup withholding, including corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations. A U.S.
Holder will be subject to backup withholding if such holder is not otherwise exempt and such holder:
 

•
 

Fails to furnish the holder’s taxpayer identification number, which for an individual is ordinarily his or her Social
Security number;

 

•
 

Furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number; or
 

•
 

Fails to certify under penalties of perjury that the holder has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed
as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely
furnished to the IRS.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 71/179

 
Non-U.S. Holders

The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a
Non-U.S. Holder. The term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of common stock that is, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes:
 

•
 

a nonresident alien individual;
 

•
 

a foreign corporation; or
 

•
 

a foreign estate or trust.

Special rules, not discussed herein, may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders, such as:
 

•
 

certain former citizens or residents of the United States;
 

•
 

controlled foreign corporations;
 

•
 

passive foreign investment companies;
 

•
 

corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; and
 

•
 

pass-through entities, or investors in such entities.

Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax
consequences that may be relevant to them in light of their particular circumstances.

In general, any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax unless:
 

•
 

the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S.
Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates
generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the
branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);

 

•
 

such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year in
which the gain is realized, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty); or

 

•
 

ARI is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the
Code (“USRPHC”) at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or such Non-U.S.
Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of common stock, which we refer to as the “relevant
period,” and such Non-U.S. Holder owns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than 5% of
our common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the
branch profits tax will not apply. Although we can make no assurances in this regard, we believe that we are not, and
have not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the Merger.

Payments made to Non-U.S. Holders in the Merger may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding.
Non-U.S. Holders generally can avoid backup withholding and information reporting by providing the paying agent with the
applicable and properly executed IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) certifying the holder’s non-U.S. status or
by otherwise establishing an exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may also be made available
under an applicable tax treaty or information exchange agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S.
Holder resides or is established.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed
as a refund or credit against a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely
furnished to the IRS.

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters

Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be completed until ARI and Parent file a
notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the “DOJ”) under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A transaction
notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of waiting period following the parties’ filing of their
respective HSR Act notification forms (typically, a 30 day period) or the early termination of the waiting period. ARI and
Parent made the necessary filings with the FTC and the DOJ on July 5, 2017. Early termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act was granted on July 14, 2017.

At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the
HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary under the applicable
statutes, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or
requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time
before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act,
any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary. Such action could include seeking to enjoin
the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or
hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal
action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

Legal Proceedings Regarding the Merger

On July 21, 2017, a putative class action lawsuit was filed by a purported shareholder of ARI against ARI and its
directors in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, captioned Sean Sharkey et al v. ARI Network
Services, Inc. et al, Case No. 17-cv-1012. The action generally alleges failure to adequately disclose material information in
violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The plaintiff seeks, among
other things, equitable relief to enjoin consummation of the Merger, rescission of the Merger and/or rescissory damages, and
attorneys’ and experts’ fees. ARI and the individual defendants all believe that the claims asserted against each of them are
without merit and intend to vigorously defend against this lawsuit.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger
Agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by
reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this
proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety because this
summary may not contain all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and
obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any
other information contained in this proxy statement.

Capitalized terms used in this section but not defined in this proxy statement have the meaning ascribed to them in
the Merger Agreement.

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (1)
were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the
parties to the Merger Agreement; and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental
information agreed to by ARI, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement.
The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally
applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC, and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to
Parent and Merger Sub by ARI in connection with the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties
may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk among ARI, Parent and
Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties
that differ from those applicable to investors. Shareholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and
should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations
of the actual state of facts or condition of ARI, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the
Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the
respective businesses of ARI, Parent and Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly
permitted in the confidential disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate
party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and
included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other
factual information regarding ARI, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations,
warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the
information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding ARI and our business.

Effects of the Merger; Directors and Officers; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws

The Merger Agreement provides that, under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in
accordance with the WBCL, at the Effective Time, (1) Merger Sub will be merged with and into ARI, and (2) the separate
existence of Merger Sub will cease, and ARI will continue to exist as the Surviving Corporation and as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.

At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will be the same as the Articles of
Incorporation of ARI immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation will be the by-
laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (with the name of the Surviving Corporation changed,
as appropriate). The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, and the officers of ARI immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal.

Closing and Effective Time

The closing of the Merger take place at 9:00 a.m., Eastern time on the second business day following the satisfaction
and/or waiver of all conditions to closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (described below under

WBCL. The Merger will become effective when the articles of merger are filed with the Wisconsin Department of Financial
Institutions, or at such later time as the parties agree and specify in the articles of merger.

Merger Consideration

Common Stock

Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties to the Merger Agreement or by Parent and the applicable shareholder, at
the Effective Time, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
ARI treasury stock, which will be automatically cancelled and retired for no payment or distribution) will be cancelled and
automatically into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (which is an amount in cash equal to $7.10 per
share without interest). All shares converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration will no longer be
outstanding and will be automatically be cancelled at the Effective Time.

Outstanding Equity Awards and Warrants

The Merger Agreement provides that ARI’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be subject to the following treatment at the Effective Time:

Options. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties to the Merger Agreement or by Parent and the applicable
option holders, ARI will take all requisite action so that each option to purchase shares of common stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, will be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount, if any, for each share of common stock subject to such option, equal to (x) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, minus (y) the sum of (1) the exercise price per share of common stock of such option and (2) any applicable
tax withholding amounts.

Restricted Shares. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties to the Merger Agreement or by Parent and the
applicable holders of restricted shares of common stock, ARI will take all requisite action so that at the Effective Time,
restricted shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest in full and become free of restrictions,
and will be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per Share
Merger Consideration less any applicable tax withholding amount.

Performance Restricted Shares. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties to the Merger Agreement or by Parent
and the applicable holders of performance restricted shares, at the Effective Time, all or a portion of the unvested
performance restricted shares will vest in accordance with the applicable provisions of the respective performance restricted
share agreements, and such vested portion of the performance restricted shares will become free of restrictions and will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration less any
applicable tax withholding amount. Any performance restricted shares that remain unvested at the Effective Time will be
forfeited.

Restricted Stock Units. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties to the Merger Agreement or by Parent and the
applicable holders of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), as of the Effective Time, each holder of restricted stock units will be
entitled to receive an amount, if any, for each share of common stock in respect of which such holder received a RSU,
whether or not then vested in accordance with the terms of the applicable restricted stock unit agreement, equal to the Per
Share Merger Consideration less any applicable tax withholding amount.

Warrants. In accordance with the terms of each warrant to purchase shares of common stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless otherwise elected by a warrant holder with respect to a warrant,
at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will purchase such warrants by paying to each warrant holder an amount of
cash equal to the Black

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 75/179

 
Scholes Value of the remaining unexercised portion of such warrant holder’s warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the Compensation Committee of ARI’s Board of Directors
will determine a date prior to the Effective Time on which the then-current offering period under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan will terminate, and accumulated payroll deductions with respect to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan on that
date will be used to purchase the applicable number of shares of ARI common stock. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan will
terminate immediately following the termination date of the then-current offering period.

Merger Fund and Payment Procedures

At or before the closing of the Merger, Parent will deposit in trust with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to ARI, which we refer to as the “paying agent,” cash in the aggregate amount (which we refer to as
the “merger fund”) equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, (ii) the aggregate amount of unpaid
fees and expenses incurred by ARI in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (provided that
the parties will determine in good faith the payment of some or all of the fees and expenses amount with cash on ARI’s
balance sheet at the time of closing), and (iii) unless otherwise agreed by the parties in good faith, the aggregate amount of
certain specified debt of ARI outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing and the amount payable in respect of any
warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Closing. The merger fund will be applied to pay (w) the consideration in
respect of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, (x) the amounts payable in respect of
warrants, (y) the fees and expenses amount to each recipient of any payments of such amount, and (z) the specified debt
amount to each recipient of any payments of such amount, except to the extent that, in the cases of clauses (x), (y) and (z), the
payment is made in another manner as agreed by the Parties pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

Promptly after the Effective Time, the paying agent will mail to each holder of record of ARI common stock a letter of
transmittal to be completed, executed and delivered by such holder to receive such holder’s portion of the merger fund, along
with and instructions for effecting the surrender of stock certificates and uncertificated shares in exchange for the Per Share
Merger Consideration. Upon proper completion, execution and delivery by a holder of record of shares of common stock to
the paying agent of a letter of transmittal and all other documentation required by the letter of transmittal (including surrender
of a stock certificate or certificates for cancellation or an affidavit of lost stock certificate as required by the letter of
transmittal), such holder shall be entitled to receive, in exchange for each share of common stock, the Per Share Merger
Consideration (less any applicable required tax withholding amounts with respect to such holder, as determined by ARI in
good faith), and the surrendered stock certificates or uncertificated shares will be cancelled.

If any cash deposited with the paying agent for purposes of payment of the consideration in exchange for shares of
common stock remains unclaimed one year after the Effective Time, the remaining cash will be returned to Parent, or its
designee, automatically, and any holder of shares of common stock who has not converted such holder’s shares of common
stock into the Per Share Merger Consideration prior to that time will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of such amount, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of common
stock five years after the Effective Time will become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest.

In the event that any stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the paying agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof. Parent or the paying agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of such Per Share Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificates to
deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that

may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the paying agent with respect to the stock certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

the Merger under the applicable provisions of the WBCL.

Acquisition Proposals

Under the Merger Agreement, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or
termination of the Merger Agreement, ARI has agreed, among other things, to:
 

•
 

cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any person or its affiliates, directors, officers,
managers, employees, consultants, agents, financing sources, attorneys, accounting, representatives and other advisors
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), and to request the prompt return or destruction of all non-
public information concerning ARI or its subsidiaries furnished to any such person with whom a confidentiality
agreement was entered into at any time within the six month period immediately preceding the date of the Merger
Agreement;

 

•
 

cease providing any further information with respect to ARI or any Acquisition Proposal to any such person or its
representatives; and

 

•
 

terminate all access granted to any such person and its representatives to any physical or electronic data room.

ARI has also agreed that neither it nor its subsidiaries will, and ARI will not instruct, authorize or knowingly permit its
and its subsidiaries’ representatives to, directly or indirectly:
 

•
 

solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making of, or knowingly encourage, any proposal, inquiry or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

 

•
 

engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any external discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-
public information or data, or afford access to ARI’s business, employees, properties, assets, books, or records to any
person (other than to Parent, Merger Sub or their designees) relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal;

 

•
 

knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal;
 

•
 

approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal;

 

•
 

enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal (except for a Comparable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below)).

Notwithstanding these restrictions, at any time prior to obtaining the approval of the Merger by ARI’s shareholders, ARI,
in response to any written Acquisition Proposal delivered to after the date of the Merger Agreement that did not result from
or arise in connection with a breach by ARI of the restrictions set forth above, may provide, subject to an executed
Comparable Confidentiality Agreement, information relating to ARI and its subsidiaries to, and engage in discussions or
negotiations with, and afford access to the business, employees, properties, assets, books and records of ARI to, the person
that submitted such written Acquisition Proposal and its representatives, provided that ARI’s Board (or a committee thereof)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial and legal advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Offer (as defined below) and that failure to engage in such discussions or
negotiations would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. ARI has
agreed to promptly (and in any event within one (1) business day) make available to Parent any non-public information
concerning ARI and its subsidiaries that is provided to any such person or its representatives that was not previously made
available to Parent.

ARI will promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) business day) notify Parent of the receipt of any inquiry, offer or
proposal that constitutes as Acquisition Proposal. Any such notice must include the identity of the person or group of persons
making the offer or proposal, copies of any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Acquisition Agreement (as defined below)
related thereto and a summary of the material terms and conditions of any unwritten Acquisition Proposal. ARI will keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any and
all Acquisition Proposals, and promptly notify Parent of any scheduled meeting of ARI’s Board or committee thereof at
which it is reasonably likely that the

9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 82/179

 
Board will consider any Acquisition Proposal, and of any determination by the Board or any committee thereof that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer.

For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement:

“Acquisition Proposal” means any bona fide indication of interest, proposal or offer from any person or group (as
defined pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) (other than Parent, Merger Sub and any of their affiliates) to
purchase, license or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (i) assets
of ARI and its subsidiaries (including securities of subsidiaries) that account for more than 20% of ARI’s consolidated assets
or from which more than 20% of ARI’s revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are derived or (ii) more than 20% of
ARI’s outstanding common stock pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital
stock, tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction;

“Alternative Acquisition Agreement” means any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal (except for a Comparable Confidentiality
Agreement);

“Comparable Confidentiality Agreement” means a confidentiality agreement containing terms not materially less
favorable in the aggregate to ARI than the terms set forth in the confidentiality agreement entered into between ARI and
Parent (except that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a “standstill” or similar provision that prohibits the
counterparty thereto from making any Acquisition Proposal, acquiring ARI or taking any other similar action);

“Intervening Event” means a positive material event, occurrence, change, effect, condition, development or state of facts
or circumstances (other than related to an Acquisition Proposal) arising after the date of the Merger Agreement that (i) was
neither known to, nor reasonably foreseeable by, ARI’s Board prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) does not
relate to any Acquisition Proposal or the mere fact, in and of itself, that ARI meets or exceeds any internal or published
projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period
ending on or after the date of the Merger Agreement, or changes after the date of the Merger Agreement in the market price
or trading volume of ARI common stock or ARI’s credit rating; and

“Superior Offer” means any bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal (a) was not obtained or made as a result of a breach
of the non-solicitation provisions described above, and (b) contains terms and conditions that the Board (or any committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, having taken into
account the financing aspects of the proposal and the likelihood and timing of consummation of the transaction contemplated
by such Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the person making the proposal and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal
that the Board deems relevant, to be more favorable from a financial point of view to ARI’s shareholders than the Merger
(taking into account any revisions to the Merger Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent during the three business
day period beginning on the date on which ARI notifies Parent that it intends to change the recommendation of the Board or
terminate the Merger Agreement in connection with a Superior Offer; provided, however, that for purposes of this definition,
the references to 20% in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of “Acquisition Proposal” will each be deemed to be a reference
to “50%.”

The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, ARI’s Board of Directors has recommended that the
holders of shares of ARI common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the
Merger. The Merger Agreement provides that the Board of Directors may not effect a Change of Recommendation except as
described below.

The Board of Directors may not (with any action described in the following being referred to as a “Change of
Recommendation”):

  •
 

withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or
modify), in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the recommendation by the Board of the Merger Agreement or
the Merger;

 

•
 

approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable or propose or resolve to approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable (publicly or otherwise), any Acquisition Proposal;

 

•
 

take any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or exchange offer,
other than a recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look and listen” communication by ARI’s Board to ARI’s
shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar
communication) (it being understood that ARI’s Board may refrain from taking a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the tenth (10th) business day after the commencement of a tender
or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of the
non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement;

 

•
 

fail to publicly reaffirm the recommendation by the Board of the Merger Agreement or the Merger within ten business
days after Parent so requests in writing (it being understood that ARI will not be obligated to make such reaffirmation
on more than one occasion); or fail to include the recommendation by the Board of the Merger Agreement or the
Merger in this proxy statement.

Prior to the Special Meeting, and notwithstanding the restrictions described above in “—Acquisition Proposals,” ARI’s
Board of Directors is permitted in certain circumstances and subject to ARI’s compliance with certain obligations (as
summarized below), to make a Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Offer and/or terminate the Merger
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate a Superior Offer, which did not result from any material
breach by ARI of the non-solicitation provisions described above, if the Board or any committee thereof determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, if and only if prior to any Change of
Recommendation or termination of the Merger Agreement in connection with a Superior Offer:
 

•
 

ARI has provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Sub, at least three business days in advance (which period
we refer to as the “Superior Offer Notice Period”), of the intention of the Board to effect a Change of
Recommendation or to terminate the Merger Agreement in connection with a Superior Offer, which notice, if
concerning an intended Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Offer or concerning an intended
termination the Merger Agreement in connection with a Superior Offer, must specify the identity of the person (or
group of persons) making such Superior Offer and the material terms and conditions of the Superior Offer (or of any
material modification thereto) and include an unredacted copy of the Superior Offer and an unredacted copy of the
then-current proposed draft alternative acquisition agreements;

 

•
 

if requested by Parent, ARI has negotiated with, and caused its representatives to negotiate with, Parent in good faith
during the Superior Offer Notice Period to make any bona fide modifications proposed by Parent to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement so that such Superior Offer would cease to constitute a “Superior Offer;”

 

•
 

either (A) Parent has not, prior to the expiration of the Superior Offer Notice Period, made a written offer to modify
the terms of the Merger Agreement in a manner that would cause such Superior Offer to cease to constitute a “Superior
Offer,” which written offer would be binding on Parent upon ARI’s acceptance, or (B) the Board (after consulting with
its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) has considered in good faith any changes to the Merger
Agreement offered in writing by Parent to modify the terms of the Merger Agreement, and has determined that the
Superior Offer continues to constitute a Superior Offer if such changes were to be given effect, and that failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law (it
being understood that any change to the financial or other material terms of an Acquisition

    Proposal that was previously the subject of a notice would require a new notice to Parent as described above, but with
respect to any such subsequent notices the Superior Offer Notice Period would be one business day rather than three
business days); and

 

•
 

in the event of any termination of the Merger Agreement in order to cause or permit ARI or any of its subsidiaries to
enter into a definitive agreement to consummate a Superior Offer, ARI will have validly terminated the Merger
Agreement.

The Board of Directors is permitted to make a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial and outside legal
advisors) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable law, and it has:
 

•
 

provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Sub, at least three business days in advance, of the intention of the
Board to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event and specifying in reasonable detail
the reasons for such Change of Recommendation; and

 

•
 

the Board or any committee thereof (after consulting with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) has
considered in good faith any changes to the Merger Agreement offered in writing by Parent with respect to an intended
Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event, and has determined that the failure to make a Change
of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable
law.

The Merger Agreement does not prohibit ARI or the Board of Directors or any committee thereof from (i) issuing a
“stop, look and listen” communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with its obligations
under Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act in response to an Acquisition Proposal, or making any disclosure to its
shareholders required (after consultation with outside legal advisors) under applicable law. In addition, the Merger
Agreement provides that a factually accurate public disclosure that describes ARI’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the
operation of the Merger Agreement with respect thereto will not be deemed a Change of Recommendation.

Employee Benefits

During the one-year period following the Closing Date, Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
ARI’s employees so long as they continue to be employed by the Surviving Corporation or any other affiliate of Parent,
substantially comparable or greater base salary and substantially comparable target annual bonus opportunity (excluding cash
long-term incentives or other equity-based incentive opportunities) to what is currently paid, as well as compensation and
employee benefits (excluding deferred compensation and cash long-term incentive and equity-based incentive opportunities)
that, with respect to each such employee, are substantially similar or greater. in the aggregate, to the compensation and
benefits provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date under ARI’s existing plans. As of the Closing
Date, the Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with all terms of all ARI employment agreements
covering ARI employees. For the purposes of this section, “ARI employee” means an employee of ARI or any of its
subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date.

During the one-year period following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation will provide each ARI employee
whose employment is involuntarily terminated (other than for cause) with severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance benefits such employee would have received with respect to termination following ARI’s severance practices
and employment agreements covering ARI employees as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date under ARI’s existing
employee plans.

The Parent will or will cause the Surviving Company to give ARI employees credit for the purposes of eligibility and
vesting (other than vesting of future equity awards) and for purposes of determining future vacation accruals and severance
amounts under any benefits plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in which such employee participates to
the same extent and for

the same purpose as recognized by ARI. Such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition is a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

Financing Efforts

Parent and Merger Sub have represented to ARI, subject to specified qualifications and assumptions, that:
 

•
 

Parent has delivered to ARI true, complete and correct copies of (i) the fully executed Equity Commitment Letter
pursuant to which TWC has committed to provide, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, equity funding
to Parent to enable Parent to provide the equity financing for the transactions contemplated under the Merger
Agreement (which we refer to as the “Equity Financing”), and (ii) a fully executed Debt Commitment Letter (together
with the Equity Commitment Letter, the “Financing Commitment Letters”) pursuant to which the Lender has
committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, to provide debt financing to Merger Sub for the
purpose of financing the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement and for other general corporate
purposes (collectively, the “Debt Financing,” and together with the Equity Financing, the “Financing”).

 

•
 

The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to provide, that ARI is a third party beneficiary thereof.
 

•
 

Each of the Financing Commitment Letters is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and each of the other
parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and, to the Parent’s knowledge, each such other party in accordance with its
terms (subject to customary exceptions), and is in full force and effect. As of the date of the Merger Agreement,
neither Parent nor, to Parent’s knowledge, any other counterparty thereto has committed any breach of any of its
covenants or other obligations set forth in, or is in default under, any of the Financing Commitment Letters, and to
Parent’s knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that would or would reasonably be expected to (i)
constitute or result in a breach or default on the part of any person under any of the Financing Commitment Letters,
(ii) constitute or result in a failure to satisfy any of the terms or conditions set forth in any of the Financing
Commitment Letters, (iii) make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Financing
Commitment Letters inaccurate in any material respect or (iv) otherwise result in any portion of the Financing not
being available. Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition
to be satisfied by it contained in the Financing Commitment Letters. None of the Financing Commitment Letters have
been withdrawn, repudiated, rescinded or terminated, or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect,
and Parent has no reason to believe that the Financing contemplated by any of the Financing Commitment Letters will
not be available as of the closing of the Merger. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amounts of the Financing, other than as set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters. Parent has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees and amounts required by any of the Financing Commitment
Letters to be paid on or before the date of the Merger Agreement. The aggregate proceeds of the Financing constitute
all of the financing required for the constitute all of the financing required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions applicable to Parent’s and Merger
Sub’s obligations to consummate the closing and that the Debt Financing and Equity Financing are funded in
accordance with their terms, the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing will be sufficient at the closing to enable
Parent to consummate on a timely basis the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub is aware of any direct or indirect limitation or other restriction on the ability of the lender parties in the
Debt Financing to provide financing for other potential purchasers of ARI.

Parent has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the

Financing on the terms set forth in the Financing Commitments Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to:
 

•
 

comply with and maintain in full force and effect the Financing Commitment Letters on the terms set forth therein, and
to promptly negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions
contained in the Financing Commitment Letters (which we refer to as the “Definitive Financing Agreements”) (and
comply with and maintain in effect the Definitive Financing Agreements);

 

•
 

satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the Financing set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters and
the Definitive Financing Agreements that are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub, and to consummate the Financing
at or prior to the Closing, including using its reasonable best efforts to cause the sources of the Financing to fund the
Financing at the Closing; and

 

•
 

enforce its rights under the Financing Commitment Letters and Definitive Financing Agreements (provided that
neither Parent nor Merger Sub will be required to seek specific performance against any financing source).

The Merger Agreement provides that, without the prior written consent of ARI, Parent may not directly or indirectly take
any action that would be reasonably likely to result in the Financing not being available, or agree to or permit any
amendment, supplement, replacement or modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of, any provision or remedy under,
any of the Financing Commitment Letters or Definitive Financing Agreement, if such amendment, supplement, replacement
or modification would or would be reasonably likely to:
 

•
 

reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing, as applicable, below the amount required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

 

•
 

impose new or additional conditions precedent, or amend, expand or modify the conditions precedent, to the Debt
Financing or the Equity Financing or any other terms of the Financing Commitment Letters in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the closing or make the funding of the Debt Financing or the
Equity Financing materially less likely to occur; or

 

•
 

adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments or
the Financing Agreements.

Subject to specified conditions, that Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, may amend the Financing Commitment Letters
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities. Upon any amendment, supplement,
modification or replacement of, or waiver of, any Financing Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement, Parent shall
deliver a copy thereof to ARI and references in the Merger Agreement to “Financing Commitments,” “Debt Commitment
Letter,” “Equity Commitment Letter” and “Definitive Financing Agreements” will include and mean such documents as
amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or waived.

If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to satisfy its obligations, the Debt Commitment Letter
expires or is terminated, or the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter otherwise becomes unavailable,
in whole or in part, for any reason, Parent is required to promptly notify ARI of such expiration, termination or unavailability
and the reasons therefor and/or the circumstances giving rise thereto and use its reasonable best efforts promptly, and in any
event prior to the closing, to arrange for alternative financing from other sources (which alternative financing shall be in an
amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, which shall not include any conditions to
funding or availability that are more onerous than, or in addition to, the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
that expired or terminated, or for which the Debt Financing contemplated thereby became unavailable, and which shall not
otherwise include terms that would reasonably be expected to make the likelihood that the Alternative Debt Financing would
be funded less likely) (the “Alternative Debt Financing”) to replace the Debt Financing contemplated by the expired or
terminated Debt Commitment Letter or which otherwise became unavailable, and to obtain a new financing commitment
letter with respect to such Alternative Debt Financing (the “Alternative Debt Commitment Letters”), copies of which shall be
promptly provided to ARI. Failure to arrange for such Alternative Debt Financing

does not relieve Parent of any of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. In the event any Alternative Debt Commitment
Letters are obtained, any reference in the Merger Agreement to the “Financing” or the “Debt Financing” will mean the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified, and any reference in the Merger Agreement to the
“Financing Commitment Letters” or the “Debt Commitment Letter” will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter
to the extent not superseded by an Alternative Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any Alternative Debt
Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect.

Parent is required under the Merger Agreement to give ARI prompt written notice upon becoming aware of (A) any
breach or default by any party to the Financing Commitment Letters or any Definitive Financing Agreements, (B) any failure
to carry out any of the terms of the Financing Commitment Letters or any the Definitive Financing Agreements by any party
thereto, (C) any actual or threatened withdrawal, rescission, termination or repudiation of any of the Financing Commitment
Letters or any Definitive Financing Agreements by any party thereto, (D) any material dispute or disagreement between or
among any of the parties to any of the Financing Commitment Letters or any Definitive Financing Agreements, or (E) the
occurrence of an event or development that Parent expects to have a material and adverse impact on the ability of Parent to
obtain all or any portion of the Financing. Parent will keep ARI informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters.

ARI, at Parent’s sole expense, has agreed to reasonably cooperate with and reasonably assist the Parent and Merger Sub
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, provided, that such cooperation and assistance will only be
required upon reasonable advance notice and in a manner as would not be unreasonably disruptive to the business or
operations of ARI or any of its subsidiaries, and shall only include such matters that would customarily be done in connection
with the arrangement of credit facilities of the same nature as the Debt Financing, including using its reasonable best efforts
to:
 

•
 

furnish Parent with the financial information required to be delivered pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter,
including any information reasonably necessary to prepare the pro forma financial statements required to be furnished
by Parent and/or Merger Sub pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, to the extent reasonably available to ARI;

 

•
 

facilitate obtaining executed payoff letters and releases of existing liens (to the extent required under the Merger
Agreement or in the Debt Commitment Letter), provided that any obligations and releases of liens contained in all
such agreements and documents will be subject to the occurrence of the closing and become effective no earlier than
the Closing Date;

 

•
 

furnish Parent with all documentation and other information reasonably required or requested with respect to the Debt
Financing under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations to the extent
requested in writing;

 

•
 

assist in the preparation of schedules and other disclosures required pursuant to the definitive financing documents as
may be reasonably requested by Parent; and

 

•
 

cooperate in Parent and Merger Sub’s efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter or any definitive document relating to the Debt Financing to the extent satisfaction thereof requires the
cooperation, or is within the control, ARI, its subsidiaries or their respective representatives (including assisting with
the return and delivery of any original stock certificates or other possessory collateral in the possession of existing
lenders or any other third party, and execution and delivery of any payoff documentation as may be required to be
delivered pursuant to the Debt Commitment letter or any of the definitive financing documentation).

Parent has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless ARI, its subsidiaries, its shareholders, its equity award holders and any
of their respective affiliates, and any employees, officers, directors, managers, members, shareholders, partners,
representatives, advisors and agents thereof, from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, penalties, costs and
expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with ARI’s cooperation and assistance with respect to the Debt
Financing or

the provision of any information utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent arising from fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by ARI. Parent will from time to time, promptly upon request by ARI, reimburse ARI for all of its
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection such cooperation.

Indemnification and Insurance

After the Effective Time, Parent will cause all rights to exculpation, indemnification and reimbursement and
advancement of expenses from liabilities, and all limitations of liability, existing in favor of the Covered Persons as provided
in their respective governing or organizational documents and any indemnification or other similar agreements of ARI or any
of its subsidiaries in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated under the Merger Agreement and will continue in full force and effect. All such rights of exculpation,
indemnification and reimbursement and advancement of expenses from liabilities, and all limitations of liability, will not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Covered Person without the consent of such affected
Covered Person. From and after the Effective Time, Parent, Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will pay all costs and
expenses to any Covered Person, as incurred in connection with enforcing the exculpation, indemnity, reimbursement,
advancement, limitations or other rights or obligations.

At the Effective Time, Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to obtain, maintain and
fully pay for irrevocable “tail” officers’ and directors’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policies naming the
Covered Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six years after the Effective Time with respect to acts
or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date. The insurance policies will contain coverage terms and be in an
amount not less favorable than the Covered Persons’ coverage currently maintained by ARI and will be reviewed and
approved in advance by ARI. In satisfying these obligations, the Surviving Corporation is not obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by ARI for coverage in ARI’s fiscal 2016.

If the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain such insurance coverage, it will obtain the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding 300% of the amount paid by ARI in fiscal 2016 from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating than ARI’s current insurance carrier. In the event a Covered Person is entitled to coverage under this “tail”
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy and such policy has lapsed,
terminated, been repudiated or is otherwise in breach or default as a result of the Parent’s or Surviving Corporation’s failure
to maintain and fulfill its obligations thereunder, Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Covered
Person such amounts and provide any other coverage or benefits as the Covered Persons would have received pursuant to this
policy.

In any proceeding arising before, at or after the Effective Time where a Covered Person would be entitled to rights of
exculpation, indemnification, reimbursement and advancement of expenses and any limitations on liability under the
applicable governing or organizational documents and any indemnification or other similar agreements of ARI, is made
against any Covered Person on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions and benefits related to
indemnification and insurance of the Covered Persons will continue in full effect until the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

Other Covenants

Shareholders Meeting

ARI will take all action necessary to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special Meeting for the purpose of
obtaining the requisite shareholder approvals, and hold the Special Meeting as promptly as practicable after the
commencement of mailing the proxy statement to ARI shareholders. Parent will cause all shares of common stock owned by
Parent or Merger Sub (if any) to be voted in favor of the Merger Agreement.

Shareholder Litigation

Prior to the Effective Time, ARI will provide Parent with prompt notice of all shareholder litigation and keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. ARI will give Parent the opportunity to participate in, but not control,
the defense and settlement of any ARI shareholder litigation against ARI or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated under the Merger Agreement and any ancillary documents, and that settlement will not be agreed to without
Parent’s prior written consent. In the event litigation is brought against Parent or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated under the Merger Agreement and any ancillary documents, Parent will promptly notify ARI of such litigation
and keep ARI informed on a current basis with respect to the status thereof and give ARI the opportunity to participate in, but
not control, the defense and settlement of any litigation.

Parent of the following conditions:

•
 

By mutual written consent of ARI and Parent prior to the Effective Time;
 

•
 

By either ARI or Parent:

the conditions to obligations of the terminating party to consummate the Merger prior to the Outside Date or the
failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to the Outside Date;

Merger by the Closing Date, and (iv) Parent fails to complete the Closing on the later of the expiration of the three
business day period, and the date on which the parties are required to close the Merger in accordance with the terms of
the Merger Agreement.

Specific Performance

Prior to any valid termination of the Merger Agreement, each of the parties has the right to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the provisions of the Merger Agreement and to enforce its rights thereunder not
only by action(s) for damages but also by action(s) for specific performance, injunctive and/or equitable relief.

However, ARI will be only entitled to specific performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and cause Parent

have been satisfied or waived, (B) Parent fails to complete the Closing by the date on which the Closing is required to have
occurred, (C) ARI has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that (x) if specific performance is granted and the Debt

will be funded and available at Closing (if the Equity Financing is funded).

Amendment

The Merger Agreement may be amended in writing by the parties to the Merger Agreement at any time before or after
the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by shareholders. However, after the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement by shareholders, no amendment that requires further approval by such shareholders without obtaining such
required approval under the WBCL.

Governing Law

The Merger Agreement is governed by Wisconsin law, provided that any disputes involving the debt financing sources
with respect to the debt financing and the performance thereof by the lenders shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

each shareholder, or group of affiliated shareholders, known to us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding
common stock;

for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person, but we do not treat them as outstanding for the

the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent and the Paying Agent, as applicable, a schedule (the “Closing
Disbursement Schedule”)), which shall set forth estimates of the following (such estimates to be updated and adjusted, if

Disbursement Schedule for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

(c) The Per Share Merger Consideration will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to
the Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

Section 2.6 Merger Fund and Payments.

(a) At or before the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with a bank or trust company
designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (such bank or trust company, the “Paying Agent”), cash
in the aggregate amount equal to the sum of (i) the Common Stock Merger Consideration, (ii) the Fees and Expenses
Amount, provided that the Parties will determine in good faith the payment of some or all of the Fees and Expenses
Amount with cash on the Company’s balance sheet at the time of Closing, and (iii) unless otherwise agreed by the Parties
in good faith, the Specified Debt Amount and the Warrant Amount (such deposit, the “Merger Fund”). The Merger Fund

benefit of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Shareholders, Warrantholders, recipients of the Fees and Expenses
Amount and recipients of the Specified Debt Amount, as the case may be, and the Merger Fund shall not be used for any

 portion of the Merger Fund comprised of the Fees and Expenses Amount, (ii) distribute to Warrantholders the portion of
the Merger Fund payable to such Warrantholders pursuant to Section 2.4(h), (iii) distribute to each recipient of any
payments of such amount the portion of the Merger Fund comprised of the Specified Debt Amount, except to the extent
that, in the cases of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the payment is made in another manner as agreed by the Parties pursuant to
Section 2.6(a), and (iv) mail to each holder of record of Shares (A) a letter of transmittal in a customary form reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to be completed, executed and delivered by such holder to receive such holder’s portion of
the Merger Fund and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of Stock Certificates and uncertificated shares in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon proper completion, execution and delivery by a holder of record
of shares of Common Stock to the Paying Agent of a Letter of Transmittal and all other documentation required by the
Letter of Transmittal (including surrender of a Stock Certificate or Stock Certificates for cancellation or an affidavit of
lost Stock Certificate as required by the Letter of Transmittal), such holder shall be entitled to receive, in exchange for
each share of Common Stock, the Per Share Merger Consideration (less any applicable Required Withholding Amounts
with respect to such holder, as determined by the Company in good faith) and the Stock Certificates or uncertificated
shares so surrendered will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of shares of
Common Stock on the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Stock Certificates. Until
surrendered, outstanding Stock Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof. At or prior to the
Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the (i) Options Payment Amount, plus (ii) the Restricted Shares Payment Amount, plus (iii) the Performance
Restricted Shares Payment Amount, plus (iv) the RSUs Payment Amount. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Optionholders in respect of Options, Awardholders in respect of Restricted Share and Performance Restricted Shares,
and RSUholders in respect of RSUs, will receive a payment from the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll system
or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such holders. All such payments will be less any Required
Withholding Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of cannot be made through the
Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such
payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly following the Closing
Date (but in no event more than two Business Days thereafter). If payment is to be made to a Person other than a
registered holder of shares of Common Stock represented by the Stock Certificate or Stock Certificates in exchange
therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Stock Certificate or Stock Certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment being made to a Person other than the
registered holder of such shares of Common Stock or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable.

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, such Stock Certificates shall be cancelled,
retired and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article
II.

(d) If any cash deposited with the Paying Agent for purposes of payment of the consideration in exchange for shares
of Common Stock in accordance with this Section 2.6 remains unclaimed one (1) year after the Effective Time, such
cash shall be returned to Parent, or its designee, automatically, and any holder of shares of Common Stock who has not
converted each of such holder’s shares of Common Stock into the Per Share Merger Consideration prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of such amount, without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by

entitled thereto.

(e) In the event that any stock certificate have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.4. Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Per Share Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
stock certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the stock certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the

(i) The Company has filed with the SEC all forms, documents and reports required to be filed or furnished prior
to the date hereof by it since July 31, 2014 (the “Company Reports”). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as
of the date of the last such amendment, the Company Reports complied, or if not yet filed or furnished, will comply,
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933 (the
“Securities Act”), as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of
the Company Reports at the time they were filed contained, or if not yet filed, will not contain, any untrue statement

 applied on a consistent basis (except as expressly disclosed in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial position
of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations
and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of any unaudited
interim financial statements, which are not material, individually or in the aggregate).

(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations that would be required to
be reflected in, or reserved against, or otherwise described on, a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP
(whether accrued or fixed, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, whether due or to become due and
regardless of when or by whom asserted), other than (A) liabilities or obligations reflected in, or reserved against, or
otherwise described in, the Historical Financial Statements, (B) liabilities or obligations which were incurred in the
Ordinary Course of Business after the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, (C) liabilities or obligations incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, or (D) liabilities or obligations that
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(iv) The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP in all material respects. The Company (i) maintains disclosure controls
and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Company’s filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents and
(ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company’s outside
auditors and the Board (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (2) any
fraud, known to the Company, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Since July 31, 2015 and through the date
of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company, no events, facts or circumstances have occurred such that
management would not be able to complete its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal
year ending July 31, 2017, and conclude, after such assessment, that such system was effective. Since July 31, 2015,
the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications required
by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has
received notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or
manner of filing of such certifications. The Company is in compliance with the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules of NASDAQ, except for any non-compliance that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company
Reports.

(f) No Conflict or Violation. The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents to which it is (or will be) a party, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, will not (i) assuming that all filings, registrations, notifications, authorizations,
consents and approvals described in Section 3.1(b) have been made or obtained (or the expiration of any applicable
waiting period), violate any applicable Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, (ii) assuming all
necessary consents required under the agreements set forth on Schedule 3.1(f) have been obtained prior to the Closing,
conflict with, result in a

 violation or breach of, constitute a default or any event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default, under, result in the acceleration of any obligations under, or require any notice under, any Company Contract, or
(iii) conflict with or violate the articles or certificate of incorporation or formation, by-laws, limited liability company
agreement or such other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except with respect to the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(g) Legal Proceedings. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no material Actions pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective
officers or members of the board of managers or board of directors (or comparable governing body) in connection with
the Business), before any Governmental Entity. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no Actions pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries challenging the validity of or
which would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay, affect or prohibit, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any material judgments, settlements, writs, decrees, injunctions or orders of any Governmental Entity.

(h) Personal Property. Except as may be reflected in, reserved against, or otherwise described on the Historical
Financial Statements (including any notes thereto), the Company and its Subsidiaries have good, marketable and valid
title to (or, in the case of leased tangible personal property, a valid and subsisting leasehold interest in), free and clear of
any Encumbrances (except for Permitted Encumbrances), all of the tangible personal property reflected in the Interim
Balance Sheet and all tangible personal property acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries since the date of the
Interim Balance Sheet, except for (i) sales or other dispositions of personal property that are replaced by similar assets or
properties, (ii) personal property sold, consumed, used or otherwise disposed in the Ordinary Course of Business since
the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, (iii) dispositions of used, worn out, obsolete or surplus assets or properties since
the date of the Interim Balance Sheet or (iv) personal property, the failure of which to have good and valid title to (or a
valid and subsisting leasehold interest in) would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The material facilities, machinery, equipment and other tangible assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been maintained in accordance with normal industry practice. The Company and its Subsidiaries own
or lease under valid leases all material facilities, machinery, equipment and other tangible assets necessary for the
conduct of the Business as currently conducted.

(i) Real Property.

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any fee title interest in real property.

(ii) Schedule 3.1(i)(ii) identifies each material written lease to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries leases interests in real property (the “Leased Real
Property”).

(iii) The Company or its applicable Subsidiary has valid leasehold title to each written lease to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the Leased Real Property (each, a “Company Lease,”
and collectively, the “Company Leases”), in each case, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances). The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all Company
Leases (including all material amendments, modifications and supplements thereto).

(iv) None of the Company Leases has been amended or extended subsequent to the date of the Interim Balance
Sheet, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has sent written notice to any landlord of any Leased
Real Property claiming that such landlord is in default under any of the Company Leases, which default remains
uncured. To the

 Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach of or default
pursuant to any Company Lease.

(v) Subleases. Section 3.1(i)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedules contains a true, correct and complete list
of all of the existing material subleases, licenses or similar agreements (each, a “Sublease”) granting to any Person,
other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any right to use or occupy, now or in the future, any Leased Real
Property. With respect to each of the Subleases, (i) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no disputes with
respect to such Sublease; and (ii) the other party to such Sublease is not an Affiliate of, and otherwise does not have
any economic interest in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(j) Taxes.

(i) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(j)(i), the Company and its Subsidiaries have accurately (in all material
respects) and timely filed (taking into account extensions) all income and all other material Tax Returns required to
have been filed by them and have timely paid all material Taxes due (whether or not shown to be due thereon). The
most recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve (in
accordance with GAAP) for all Taxes accrued but not then payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries through the
date of such financial statements. The Company and its Subsidiaries have timely paid or withheld with respect to
their employees and other third Persons (and paid over any amounts withheld to the appropriate Tax authority) all
material Taxes required to be paid or withheld.

(ii) As of the date hereof, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened Actions for the
assessment or collection of material Taxes owed or owing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No audits or
other examinations with respect to Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries are presently in progress or have been
asserted or proposed to the Company or its Subsidiaries in writing. No written claim has ever been made to the
Company or its subsidiaries by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, is or may be subject
to tax in that jurisdiction.

(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has executed or filed with any Taxing Authority any
agreement extending the period for assessment or collection of any Taxes which has not since expired.

(iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is a party to or bound by, or currently has any material
liability pursuant to, any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or obligation, other than any such
agreement or obligation entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business; or (ii) has any material liability for the
Taxes of any Person other than the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 (or
any similar provision of state, local or non-United States law) as a transferee or successor, or otherwise by operation
of law.

(v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have entered into, or participated in, any “listed
transaction” within the meaning of Section 6707A(c)(2) of the Code.

(vi) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a “distributing corporation” or a
“controlled corporation” in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment pursuant to Section 355
of the Code.

(vii) The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 3.1(j) shall constitute the Company’s sole
representations and warranties with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns.

(k) Absence of Certain Changes. Since July 31, 2016, until the date of this Agreement, there has not occurred any
Material Adverse Effect. Except as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, since the date
of the Interim Balance Sheet until the date of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries have operated the
Business in the Ordinary Course of Business in all material respects (subject to the effects resulting from the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction

beneficiary thereof as set forth therein. On or prior to the date hereof, Parent has also delivered to the Company a true,
complete and correct copy of the fully executed fee letter (which fee letter may be redacted as customary for financings
of this type) that relates to the Debt Financing (the “Fee Letter”). Each of the Financing Commitment Letters is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and each of the other parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, each such other party in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and is in full force and
effect. Assuming the accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1 of this
Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other counterparty
thereto has committed any breach of any of its covenants or other obligations set forth in, or is in default under, any of
the Financing Commitment Letters, and to the Knowledge of Parent no event has occurred or circumstance exists that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute or result in a
breach or default on the part of any Person under any of the Financing Commitment Letters, (ii) constitute or result in a
failure to satisfy any of the terms or conditions set forth in any of the Financing Commitment Letters, (iii) make any of
the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters inaccurate in any material
respect or (iv) otherwise result in any portion of the Financing not being available. Assuming the accuracy of the
Company’s representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement,
Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition to be satisfied by
it contained in the Financing Commitment Letters. None of the Financing Commitment Letters have been withdrawn,
repudiated, rescinded or terminated, or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect (and no such
withdrawal, repudiation, rescission, termination, amendment, supplement or modification is contemplated), and Parent
has no reason to believe that the Financing contemplated by any of the Financing Commitment Letters will not be
available as of the Closing. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amounts of the Financing, other than as set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters. Except for the Fee Letter (which
contains no additional conditions to those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter), there are no agreements, side
letters, Contracts, understandings or arrangements to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party relating to the
Financing Commitment Letters or the Financing. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees and
amounts required by any of the Financing Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. The
aggregate proceeds of the Financing constitute all of the financing required for the payment by Parent of the Merger
Consideration, the Specified Debt Amount, the Fees and Expenses Amount, and all

 fees and expenses incurred by Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents or for which Parent is liable pursuant hereto or thereto. Assuming (x) satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 4.1 and (y) the Debt Financing and Equity Financing are funded in accordance with their
terms, the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing will be sufficient at the Closing to enable Parent to consummate on a
timely basis the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor MergerSub is aware of any direct or
indirect limitation or other restriction on the ability of the lender parties in the Debt Financing to provide financing for
other potential purchasers of the Company.

(i) Solvency. As of the Closing, and after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be Solvent. Each of Parent and
MergerSub do not intend, in consummating the transactions contemplated herein, to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors.

(j) Proxy Statement. None of the information with respect to Parent or MergerSub that Parent furnishes in writing to
the Company expressly for use in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the
Shareholders or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof or at the time of the Company Shareholders’
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(k) Ownership of Common Stock. None of Parent, MergerSub or True Wind Capital, L.P. or any of its affiliated
investment funds beneficially owns (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) any shares
of Common Stock or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Common Stock or other securities of, or any other
economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Company.

(l) Interests in Competitors. Neither Parent nor MergerSub owns any interest, nor do any of their respective
Affiliates own any interest insofar as such Affiliate-owned interest would be attributed to Parent or MergerSub under the
HSR Act, in any Person that derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the same or a substantially similar line of
business as the Business.

(m) Litigation. There is no suit, action or other proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or MergerSub that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
impair or delay Parent’s or MergerSub’s performance of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents to which it is (or will be) a party, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, nor is there any decree, injunction, judgment, order, ruling, assessment or writ of any Governmental Entity
outstanding against or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or MergerSub that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay Parent’s or MergerSub’s performance
of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents to which it is (or will be) a party, or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

(o) Absence of Certain Agreements. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any contract,
agreement, arrangement or understanding, or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any binding contract,
agreement, arrangement or understanding, pursuant to which any Shareholder would be entitled to receive consideration
of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any Shareholder (a) agrees to vote to
approve this Agreement or the Merger (b) agrees to vote against any Superior Offer or (c) as of the date hereof, has
agreed to provide equity capital, directly or indirectly, to Parent or MergerSub to finance in whole or in part the Merger.
There are no Contracts or commitments to enter into any such Contracts to which the Parent, the MergerSub or any of
their Affiliates is party pursuant to which any current employee of the Company has agreed to (i) remain as an employee
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries following the Effective Time at compensation levels in excess of
levels currently in effect (other than pursuant to any Company Benefit Plans or Contracts with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in effect as of the

 date hereof), (ii) contribute any portion of such employee’s shares of Common Stock, Options or RSUs to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or the Parent or any of its Affiliates or (iii) receive any capital stock or equity securities of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the Parent or any of its Affiliates.

(p) RELIANCE/ACKNOWLEDGMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS TO THE CONTRARY, PARENT
AND MERGERSUB ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY MADE BY THE COMPANY IN SECTION 3.1 OF THIS AGREEMENT (AS

WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY OR ANY SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY OR
THEIR RESPECTIVE OPERATIONS OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE MERGER; (II) PARENT AND MERGERSUB HAVE NOT EXECUTED OR AUTHORIZED THE

CONDITION, VALUE, QUALITY OR PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANY, ANY SUBSIDIARIES OF THE
COMPANY, ANY ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY OR ANY SUBSIDIARIES OF THE
COMPANY OR THE BUSINESS OR ANY PART THEREOF; AND (III) NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR
ANY OTHER PERSON HAS MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, AS TO THE ACCURACY
OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY PROJECTION, FORECAST, STATEMENT OR INFORMATION MADE,
COMMUNICATED OR FURNISHED (ORALLY, IN WRITING, ELECTRONICALLY OR OTHERWISE) TO
PARENT OR MERGERSUB OR ANY OTHER PERSON IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANY OTHER
PERSON WILL HAVE OR BE SUBJECT TO ANY LIABILITY TO PARENT OR MERGERSUB FROM THE

with each other before Parent, MergerSub or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates issues, and in advance of such
issuance give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and neither Parent nor MergerSub nor
the Company nor any of their respective Affiliates shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law or court process. The
Company and Parent agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this

transactions contemplated hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement by and
between the Company and Parent dated March 20, 2017 (the “Confidentiality Agreement”). The terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement are hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which
time the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, subject to Section 6.1(c) hereof.

Section 5.4 Access to Information. Subject to Section 5.3 hereof, from the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, at Parent’s
expense, afford the advisors, representatives, officers, directors, employees, auditors and other agents of Parent (provided,
that Parent shall cause such advisors, representatives, officers, directors, employees, auditors and other agents to treat any
information gained thereby as confidential) reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
written notice, and subject to reasonable rules and regulations of the Company, to (a) the Specified Company Employees and,
with the prior written consent of a Specified Company Employee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), any of the other employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to which any Specified Company Employee
provides his consent, (b) the properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (c) to the extent
not prohibited by Law, all books and records, and all financial, operating and other data and information, with respect to the
Business that are in the possession of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as Parent may reasonably request;
provided, however, (i) if the Company so requires, Parent’s representatives conducting any physical inspection of the
properties, offices or other facilities of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries shall be accompanied by one or more
representatives of the Company and (ii) the Company shall not be required to provide any such access to the extent that it
would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (w) disclose information subject to attorney-client privilege as
advised by the Company’s outside counsel (after taking into account the potential for a “continuity of interest” or similar
agreement; provided, that, in any event, the Company will disclose to Parent that it is withholding information in reliance
upon this Section 5.4), (x) disclose information that would cause significant competitive harm to the Company or its
Subsidiaries if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, (y) violate applicable Law, or (z)
violate any confidentiality obligations to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound. All requests for such access
shall be directed to a Specified Company Employee or such other person as the Company may designate in writing to Parent
from time to time. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the Closing, without the express prior written
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, neither Parent nor MergerSub, nor any of their
advisors, representatives, officers, directors, employees, auditors or other agents shall contact any customers to, or vendors or
suppliers of, the Company, or shall have any right to perform sampling or any invasive or subsurface investigations of any
properties or facilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In exercising its rights hereunder, Parent shall, and shall
cause its advisors, representatives, officers, directors, employees, auditors and other agents to conduct themselves so as not to
unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the Business of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Parent shall,
at its sole cost and expense, promptly reimburse the Company for any loss or damage arising from or caused by Parent’s
exercise of its rights under this Section 5.4 and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries
from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by
any of them relating to any injury or damage to any Person or property arising or resulting therefrom.

Section 5.5 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall
cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill as promptly as practicable the conditions
precedent to the parties’ obligations hereunder that are within their respective control.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.5(a), the Company and Parent shall make all filings, applications and
submissions required by the HSR Act or any other applicable competition Laws no later than ten (10) Business Days
following the date of this Agreement,

 and promptly file any additional information requested as soon as practicable after receipt of such request therefor. In
connection with any filing, application or submission under the HSR Act or any other applicable competition Law: (i)
the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and shall furnish to the other party all information necessary or
desirable in connection with making any filing, application or submission under the HSR Act or any other applicable
competition Law, and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry by any Governmental Entity under
any competition Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly inform the other of any communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or
agreement with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such filing, application or submission, or any such investigation
or other inquiry; (iii) neither the Company nor Parent shall participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any such filing, application, submission, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party
reasonable prior notice of the meeting and, if requested by the other party, the Company or Parent (as applicable) shall
request that the other party be permitted to attend the meeting; and (iv) each of the Company and Parent shall consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either such party in connection with all meetings, actions
and proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other applicable competition Laws; provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Company nor Parent (nor their respective ultimate
parent entities, as such term is used in the HSR Act) shall be required to disclose to any other party, any information
contained in its HSR Notification and Report Form (or other applicable form, filing, application or submission made or
submitted under any other applicable competition Law) which such party, in its sole and reasonable discretion, deems
confidential. Each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be
required to cause the termination or expiration of the waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other applicable
competition Laws as promptly as possible after the date of this Agreement (including, without limitation, specifically
requesting early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act or other applicable competition Laws).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent agrees to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under the HSR Act and any other applicable competition Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity or any other Person so as to enable the parties to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated hereby,
including consenting to any divestiture of assets or other structural or conduct relief in order to obtain clearance from any
Governmental Entity under the HSR Act and any other applicable competition Laws and, at the request of the Company,
Parent and its Affiliates shall be obligated to contest, administratively or in court, any ruling, order or other Action of
any Governmental Entity or any other Person respecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
shall bear its own costs in connection with the preparation or the making of any filing under the HSR Act or any other
applicable competition Law, or resolving any investigation or other inquiry by any Governmental Entity under the HSR
Act or any other applicable competition Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
that Parent shall be solely responsible for the payment of any applicable filing fees under the HSR Act and any other
applicable competition Law.

Section 5.6 Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification.

(a) After the Effective Time, all rights to exculpation, indemnification and reimbursement and advancement of
expenses, and all limitations on liability, existing in favor of any current or former officer or member of the board of
directors or board of managers (or comparable governing body) of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the “Company Indemnitees”), as provided in the articles or certificate of incorporation or formation,
limited liability company agreement, by-laws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and/or in any agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for similar
rights and limitations in favor of any of the Company Indemnitees, in any such case as in effect as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall

 survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and continue in full force and effect, and Parent shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to, honor all such rights and limitations
after the Effective Time in accordance with their terms. All such rights of exculpation, indemnification and
reimbursement and advancement of expenses, and all such limitations on liability, shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnitee without the consent of such affected Company
Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Company Indemnitees shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
5.6). From and after the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries of the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all costs and expenses to any Company Indemnitee, as incurred, in connection with enforcing the
exculpation, indemnity, reimbursement, advancement, limitations or other rights or obligations provided for in this
Section 5.6(a).

(b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, obtain,
maintain and fully pay for irrevocable “tail” officers’ and directors’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
policies naming the Company Indemnitees as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six (6) years after the
Effective Time in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, such insurance policies to
contain terms with respect to coverage and to be in an amount not less favorable than the officers’ and directors’ liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the
date of this Agreement and shall be reviewed by, and approved in advance by, the Company (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.6(b), the
Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the
Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance carrier. In the event that any Company Indemnitee is entitled to coverage under any such officers’ and
directors’ liability insurance policy or fiduciary liability insurance policy pursuant to this Section 5.6(b) and any such
policy has lapsed, terminated, been repudiated or is otherwise in breach or default as a result of Parent’s, the Surviving
Corporation’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ failure to maintain and fulfill its obligations pursuant to such policy, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary to, pay to the Company Indemnitee such amounts and
provide any other coverage or benefits as the Company Indemnitee shall have received pursuant to such policy.

(c) The articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers
than are presently set forth in the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Company in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

(d) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary (or their respective successors and assigns) shall assume in
writing the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) with respect to which a Company Indemnitee would be entitled to rights to exculpation, indemnification,
reimbursement and advancement of expenses

 and any limitations on liability under the applicable articles or certificate of incorporation or formation, limited liability
company agreement, by-laws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and/or in any
agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for similar rights and limitations in
favor of any of the Company Indemnitees, is made against any Company Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions and benefits of this Section 5.6 shall continue in full effect until the
final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(f) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a Company
Indemnitee is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.6 shall survive
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that
may be to the contrary, and expressly are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Company
Indemnitees and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

Section 5.7 Notification of Certain Matters.

(a) The Company may, at any time and from time to time after the date of this Agreement, supplement or amend any
of the Company Disclosure Schedules, or may add any additional Company Disclosure Schedules for informational
purposes only and without limiting Parent’s rights pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing
until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VI and the Effective Time, the
Company will give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by the Company to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and MergerSub to consummate the Merger set forth
in Section 4.1(a)(i) or Section 4.1(a)(ii) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing, except that no such notification will affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and MergerSub to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this
Agreement.

(c) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing
until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article V and the Effective Time, Parent will
give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by Parent or
MergerSub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by Parent or
MergerSub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure
would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the
Merger set forth in Section 4.2(a)(i) or Section 4.2(a)(ii) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing, except that no such
notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or MergerSub set forth in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to
the Parties under this Agreement.

Section 5.8 No Solicitation.

(a) After the date of this Agreement and until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement, the Company will cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person or its
Affiliates, directors, officers, managers, employees, consultants, agents, Financing Sources, attorneys, accounting,
representatives and other advisors that would be prohibited by this Section 5.8, request the prompt return or destruction
of all non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries theretofore furnished to any such Person with
whom a confidentiality agreement was entered into at any

 time within the six month period immediately preceding the date of this Agreement and will (A) cease providing any
further information with respect to the Company or any Acquisition Proposal to any such Person or its directors, officers,
managers, employees, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and representatives (the
“Representatives”); and (B) terminate all access granted to any such Person and its Representatives to any physical or
electronic data room. After the date of this Agreement and until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall not instruct, authorize or
knowingly permit its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, propose or induce
the making of, or knowingly encourage, any proposal, inquiry or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any external discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data, or afford access to the business, employees,
properties, assets, books, or records of the Company, to any Person (other than to Parent, MergerSub or any designees of
Parent or MergerSub) relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any
proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; or (v) enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an
Acquisition Proposal (except for a Comparable Confidentiality Agreement) (any such letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal, an
“Alternative Acquisition Agreement”).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, the Company, in response to any written Acquisition Proposal delivered to the
Company after the date of this Agreement that did not result from or arise in connection with a material breach by the
Company of Section 5.8(a), may provide, if prior to providing such information the Company receives from the Person
so requesting such information an executed Comparable Confidentiality Agreement, information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, and engage in discussions or negotiations with, and afford access to the business,
employees, properties, assets, books and records of the Company to, the Person that submitted such written Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives, provided that the Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Offer and that failure to engage in such discussions or negotiations would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company
will promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) make available to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives that was not
previously made available to Parent.

(c) The Company agrees that it shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day) notify Parent of the
receipt of any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes as Acquisition Proposal which must include (i) the identity of the
Person or “group” of Persons making such offer or proposal, (ii) copies of any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative
Acquisition Agreement related thereto, (iii) a summary of the material terms and conditions of any unwritten Acquisition
Proposal, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of any material developments, discussions or
negotiations regarding any and all Acquisition Proposals. The Company shall (A) promptly notify Parent of any
scheduled meeting of the Board (or any committee thereof) at which it is reasonably likely that the Board (or any
committee thereof) will consider any Acquisition Proposal, and (B) promptly notify Parent of any determination by the
Board (or any committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer.

(d) Subject to paragraph (e) below, the Board shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify (or publicly
propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent or MergerSub, the
recommendation by the Board of

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/879796/000093041317002760/c88844_defm14a.htm 152/179

 this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable or propose or resolve to approve,
recommend or otherwise declare advisable (publicly or otherwise), any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) take any formal action
or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a
recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) to the Company Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain
from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the 10th Business Day after
the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action
being considered a violation of this Section 5.8); (iv) fail to publicly reaffirm the Board Recommendation within 10
Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (it being understood that the Company will have no obligation to make
such reaffirmation on more than one occasion), or (v) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement (any action described in clauses (i) through (v), a “Change of Recommendation”).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to, but not after, the time the
Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Board may effec ta Change of Recommendation in response to a
Superior Offer and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(viii) to enter into a definitive agreement to
consummate a Superior Offer as contemplated herein, which Superior Offer did not result from any material breach by
the Company of Section 5.8, if the Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, if and only if prior to any Change of Recommendation or termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(viii):

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and MergerSub, at least three (3) Business
Days in advance (the “Superior Offer Notice Period”), of the intention of the Board (or any committee thereof) to
effect a Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(viii), which notice, if
concerning an intended Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Offer or concerning an intended
termination pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(viii) of this Agreement, shall specify the identity of the Person (or group of
Persons) making such Superior Offer and the material terms and conditions thereof (or of any material m odificatio
n thereto ) and includean unredacted copy of the Superior Offer an dan unredacted copy of the then-current
proposed draft alternative acquisition agreements;

(ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated with, and shall have caused its representatives to
negotiate with, Parent in good faith during the Superior Offer Notice Period to make any bona fide modifications
proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Offer would cease to
constitute a “Superior Offer” hereunder;

(iii) either (A) Parent shall not have, prior to the expiration of the Superior Offer Notice Period, made a written
offer to modify the terms of this Agreement in a manner that would cause such Superior Offer to cease to constitute
a “Superior Offer” hereunder, which written offer would be binding on Parent upon the Company’s acceptance
thereof or (B) the Board (or any committee thereof) (after consulting with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement offered in writing by Parent to
modify the terms of this Agreement, and shall have determined that such Superior Offer continues to constitute a
Superior Offer if such changes were to be given effect and that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed
that any change to the financial or other material terms of an Acquisition Proposal that was previously the subject of
a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to any such subsequent
notices

 references herein to “three (3) Business Days” shall be deemed references to “one (1) Business Day”); and
(iv) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or permit the Company or any of its

Subsidiaries to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate a Superior Offer, the Company will have validly
terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1(a)(viii).

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to (but not after) obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, the Board (or any committee thereof) may make an Change of Recommendation in response to a
positive material event, occurrence, change, effect, condition, development or state of facts or circumstances (other than
related to an Acquisition Proposal) arising after the date of this Agreement that (i) was neither known to, nor reasonably
foreseeable by, the Board prior to the date of this Agreement, and (ii) does not relate to (A) any Acquisition Proposal or
(B) the mere fact, in and of itself, that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts,
estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period ending on or after the
date of this Agreement, or changes after the date of this Agreement in the market price or trading volume of the
Common Stock or the credit rating of the Company (an “Intervening Event”) (it being understood that the underlying
cause of any of the foregoing in this clause (B) may be considered and taken into account in determining whether an
Intervening Event has occurred), only if the Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors’ exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that no Change of
Recommendation may be made unless (i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and
MergerSub, at least three (3) Business Days in advance, of the intention of the Board (or any committee thereof) to effect
a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for
such Change of Recommendation and (ii) the Board (or any committee thereof) (after consulting with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement offered
in writing by Parent with respect to an intended Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event, and
shall have determined that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) from issuing a “stop, look and listen” communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from
making any disclosure to the Company’s Shareholders required (after consultation with outside legal advisors) under
applicable Law, it being understood that nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Board to
effect a Change of Recommendation other than in accordance with Section 5.8(e) or (f). For the avoidance of doubt, a
factually accurate public statement that describes the Company’s receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of
this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a Change of Recommendation.

(h) The Company agrees that any material breach of this Section 5.8 by any of its Representatives will be deemed to
be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

Section 5.9 Proxy Statement.

As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (any in any event within thirty (30) days), the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form. The Company may not file the
Proxy Statement or any Other Filing with the SEC without first providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the Company will give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent or its counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC all Other Filings, if any, that are required pursuant

 to applicable Law to be filed by such party in connection with the Merger, and the Company shall cause the Proxy
Statement (and all other proxy materials) to be mailed to the Shareholders as promptly as practicable after the earlier of
(x) receiving notification that the SEC or its staff is not reviewing the Proxy Statement, (y) the expiration of the 10-day
period after filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement, in the event the SEC has failed to affirmatively notify the
Company within such period that it will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement, or (z) the conclusion of any SEC
or staff review of the Proxy Statement. If necessary to comply with applicable Law, after the Proxy Statement shall have
been mailed, the Company shall promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy material, and, if
required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Shareholders (if
applicable) and at the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting, neither the Proxy Statement nor any Other Filing will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.
The Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, MergerSub and their respective Affiliates, on the other
hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing
without first providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such written communication,
and each party will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the other
parties or their respective counsel. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and MergerSub, on the other hand, will
advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any
amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing; (ii) any receipt of comments from the SEC or its
staff on the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing; or (iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for additional
information in connection therewith.

Section 5.10 Company Shareholders’ Meeting.

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary under all applicable Law to call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of the Shareholders (the “Company Shareholders’ Meeting”) for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, (ii) the Company Shareholders’ Meeting shall be held as promptly as practicable after the
commencement of the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Shareholders, and (iii) Parent shall cause all shares of
Common Stock owned by Parent or MergerSub, if any, to be voted in favor of the approval of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the
Company Shareholders’ Meeting (x) to the extent it reasonably believes is necessary to comply with any applicable Law
or (y) if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders’ Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of such Company Shareholders’ Meeting or to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval (it being understood
that the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting more than two times pursuant to this
clause (y) without Parent’s prior written consent).

(b) The Company shall establish a record date in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation, the Bylaws,
NASDAQ rules and applicable Law, for purposes of determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to notice of and
vote at the Company Shareholders’ Meeting (the “Record Date”).

(c) Subject to Section 5.8 of this Agreement and provided there shall not have been a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with Section 5.8 of this Agreement, (i) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the
Board (x) has determined and believes that the Merger is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company
and its Shareholders, (y) has approved this Agreement and the Merger, and (z) recommends that the Shareholders vote to
approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Shareholders’ Meeting, and (ii) the Company shall

Section 5.11 Financing.

Financing Agreements), (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the Financing set forth in the Financing
Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements that are applicable to Parent and MergerSub, and to
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using its reasonable best efforts to cause the sources of
the Financing to fund the Financing at the Closing, and (iv) enforce its rights under the Financing Commitment Letter
and Definitive Financing Agreements (provided that nothing herein shall be construed to require Parent or MergerSub to
seek specific performance against any Financing Source). Parent shall provide the Company with drafts (when available)
and thereafter true and complete and executed copies on or prior to the date of this Agreement of the Financing
Commitment Letters (including the Fee Letter which may be redacted as customary for financings of this type) and shall
give the Company prompt written notice upon becoming aware of (A) any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
breach or default) by any party to the Financing Commitment Letters or any Definitive Financing Agreements, (B) any
failure to carry out any of the terms of the Financing Commitment Letters or any the Definitive Financing Agreements
by any party thereto, (C) any actual or threatened withdrawal, rescission, termination or repudiation of any of the
Financing Commitment Letters or any Definitive Financing Agreements by any party thereto, (D) any material dispute or
disagreement between or among any of the parties to any of the Financing Commitment Letters or any Definitive
Financing Agreements, or (E) the occurrence of an event or development that Parent expects to have a material and
adverse impact on the ability of Parent to obtain all or any portion of the Financing. Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters. Without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent shall not
(A) agree to or permit any amendment, supplement, replacement or modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of,
any provision or remedy under, any of the Financing Commitment Letters, the Fee Letters or Definitive Financing
Agreement, if such amendment, supplement, replacement or modification would or would be reasonably likely to (i)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing, as applicable, below the amount required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) impose new or additional conditions precedent, or
amend, expand or modify the conditions precedent, to the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing or any other terms of
the Financing Commitment Letters in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
Closing or make the funding of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing materially less likely to occur, or (iv)
adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments or the
Financing Agreements (collectively, the “Restricted Commitment Letter Amendments”) (provided, that Parent or
MergerSub, as applicable, may amend the Financing Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Financing Commitment Letters as of the date hereof, but
only if the addition of such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in (i) the occurrence of a
Restricted Commitment Letter Amendment, (ii) any waiver of any right or remedy under the Commitment Letters if such
waiver would result in the occurrence of a Restricted Commitment Letter Amendment, or (iii) early termination of the
Financing

 Commitment Letters), or (B) directly or indirectly take any action that would or would be reasonably expected to result
in the Financing not being available. Upon any amendment, supplement, modification or replacement of, or waiver of,
any Financing Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement in accordance with this Section 5.11(a), Parent shall
deliver a copy thereof to the Company and references herein to “Financing Commitments,” “Debt Commitment Letter,”
“Equity Commitment Letters” and “Definitive Financing Agreements” shall include and mean such documents as
amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or waived in compliance with this Section 5.11(a), and references to
“Financing,” “Debt Financing” and “Equity Financing” shall include and mean the financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitments or Definitive Financing Agreements as amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or waived
in compliance with this Section 5.11(a), as applicable.

(b) Without limiting the effect of Section 5.11(c), if, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to
satisfy its obligations under Section 5.11(a), the Debt Commitment Letter expires or are terminated, or the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter otherwise becomes unavailable, in whole or in part, for any
reason, Parent shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such expiration, termination or unavailability and the reasons
therefor and/or the circumstances giving rise thereto and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts promptly, and in any event
prior to the Closing, to arrange for alternative financing from other sources (which alternative financing shall be in an
amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, which shall not include any conditions
to funding or availability that are more onerous than, or in addition to, the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter that expired or terminated, or for which the Debt Financing contemplated thereby became unavailable, and which
shall not otherwise include terms that would reasonably be expected to make the likelihood that the Alternative Debt
Financing would be funded less likely) (the “Alternative Debt Financing”) to replace the Debt Financing contemplated
by the expired or terminated Debt Commitment Letter(s) or which otherwise became unavailable, and to obtain a new
financing commitment letter with respect to such Alternative Debt Financing (the “Alternative Debt Commitment
Letters”), copies of which shall be promptly provided to the Company (which Fee Letter may be redacted in a customary
manner (so long as the redaction does not cover terms that would adversely affect the conditionality, availability or
termination of the Debt Financing)). It is understood and agreed by Parent that the failure to arrange for such Alternative
Debt Financing does not relieve Parent of any of its obligations under this Agreement. In the event any Alternative Debt
Commitment Letters are obtained, (x) any reference in this Agreement to the “Financing” or the “Debt Financing” shall
mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to clause (y) below and (y)
any reference in this Agreement to the “Financing Commitment Letters” or the “Debt Commitment Letters” shall be
deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded by an Alternative Debt Commitment Letter
at the time in question and any Alternative Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, at the sole cost and expense of Parent, reasonably cooperate with
and reasonably assist the Parent and MergerSub in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing; provided,
that such cooperation and assistance shall only be required upon reasonable advance notice and in a manner as would not
be unreasonably disruptive to the business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall only
include such matters that would customarily be done in connection with the arrangement of credit facilities of the same
nature as the Debt Financing, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) to the extent not available in the Company
Reports, furnish Parent with the financial information required to be delivered pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter
(including pursuant to paragraph 3 of Exhibit B thereof, and including, to the extent not available in the Company
Reports or otherwise publicly filed, any information reasonably necessary to prepare the pro forma financial statements
required to be furnished by Parent and/or MergerSub pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter (or the analogous
provision in any amendment, restatement, amendment and restatement, replacement, substitution, supplement or other
modification thereof that is required or permitted hereunder)), to the extent reasonably

 available to the Company, (ii) facilitate obtaining executed payoff letters and releases of existing Liens (to the extent
required hereunder or in the Debt Commitment Letter), provided that any obligations and releases of Liens contained in
all such agreements and documents shall be subject to the occurrence of the Closing Date and become effective no
earlier than the Closing Date, (iii) furnish (at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) Parent with all
documentation and other information reasonably required or requested with respect to the Debt Financing under
applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations to the extent requested in writing at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (iv) assist in the preparation of schedules and other disclosures
required pursuant to the definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, and (v) cooperate in
Parent and MergerSub’s efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive document relating to the Debt Financing to the extent satisfaction thereof requires the cooperation, or is within
the control, of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective representatives (including assisting with the return and
delivery of any original stock certificates or other possessory collateral in the possession of existing lenders or any other
third party, and execution and delivery of any payoff documentation as may be required to be delivered pursuant to the
Debt Commitment letter or any of the definitive financing documentation). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the Company’s Subsidiaries, the Shareholders, the Awardholders and any of their respective Affiliates, and
any employees, officers, directors, managers, members, stockholders, partners, representatives, advisors and agents
thereof, from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, penalties, costs and expenses suffered or incurred by any
of them in connection with the Company’s cooperation and assistance with respect to the Debt Financing or the
provision of any information utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent arising from fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by the Company. Parent shall from time to time, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with this Section 5.11(c).

(d) Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company, nor the Company’s Subsidiaries, the Shareholders,
the Awardholders nor any of their respective Affiliates, nor any employees, officers, directors, managers, members,
stockholders, partners, representatives, advisors or agents thereof, shall have any responsibility for any financing that
Parent may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent arising from fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than, if the Closing occurs, the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date). Any offering memorandum, bankers’ book or other materials prepared by or on
behalf of Parent or its Affiliates, or Parent’s Financing Sources, in connection with the Parent’s financing activities
related to the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, “Offering Materials”) that include any information
provided by or on behalf of the Company, the Company’s Subsidiaries, the Shareholders, the Awardholders or any of
their respective Affiliates, or any employees, officers, directors, managers, members, stockholders, partners,
representatives, advisors or agents thereof, shall include a conspicuous disclaimer to the effect that neither the Company,
the Company’s Subsidiaries, the Shareholders, the Awardholders nor any of their respective Affiliates (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date), nor any employees, officers, directors, managers, members,
stockholders, partners, representatives, advisors or agents thereof, have any responsibility for the content of such
Offering Materials and disclaim all responsibility therefor and shall further include such a disclaimer in any oral
disclosure with respect to such financing activities.

Section 5.12 WARN Act. Schedule 5.12 provides a list of all employees of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
who have experienced, or to the Knowledge of the Company, will experience, an “employment loss” or “layoff” (as those
terms are defined in the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act, or any analogous state or local Law
(collectively, the “WARN Act”)) at any time during the ninety (90) days prior to the date of this Agreement. Such list shall
include each such employee’s (a) name, (b) date of hire, (c) position, (d) date of

shall update Schedule 5.12 to include all employees of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries who have experienced, or to
the Knowledge of the Company, will experience, an “employment loss” or “layoff” at any time during the ninety (90) days
prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, at any time after the date of
this Agreement and before the Closing Date, without complying with the notice requirements and other requirements of the
WARN Act, effectuate (i) a “plant closing” (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment or one or more
facilities or operating units within any site of employment of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) a “mass layoff” (as
defined in the WARN Act) at any site of employment of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iii) any similar action
under the WARN Act requiring notice to employees in the event of an employment loss or layoff. Parent shall be liable for
any WARN Act obligations and liability relating thereto after the Closing Date. The provisions of this Section 5.12 shall
survive the Closing.

Section 5.13 No Control of Business. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent or MergerSub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct any aspect of the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ respective business, assets
and operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

Section 5.14 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take such further actions, if any, as may
be reasonably necessary or appropriate to ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including any
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any officer or director of the Company
who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.15 NASDAQ Delisting; Exchange Act Deregistration. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
reasonably cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done

enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Common Stock from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the
Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

Section 5.16 Shareholder Litigation. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will provide Parent with prompt notice
of all Shareholder Litigation (including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in, but not control,
the defense and settlement of any Shareholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents, and no such settlement will be agreed to without
Parent’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). In the event that
any Shareholder litigation related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents is
brought against Parent or its directors, Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such litigation and keep the Company
informed on a current basis with respect to the status thereof and give the Company the opportunity to participate in, but not
control, the defense and settlement of any such litigation.

Surviving Corporation to, provide to each Company Employee, for so long as the Company Employee remains so
employed by the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of Parent, (i) substantially similar or greater base salary
and substantially similar target annual bonus opportunity (excluding cash long-term incentive and other broad-based
equity-based incentive opportunities) provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and
(ii) other compensation and employee benefits (excluding deferred compensation, and cash long-term incentive and
equity-based incentive opportunities) that, with respect to each employee, are substantially similar or greater in the
aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date under the
Company Plans set forth on Schedule 3.1(r)(i). Without limiting the foregoing, as of

 the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, comply with the terms of all employment
agreements covering Company Employees. “Company Employee” means any employee of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall provide each Company Employee whose employment is involuntarily
terminated other than for cause during the one- (1) year period immediately following the Closing Date with severance
benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits which such employee would have received with respect to
such termination following the severance practices of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and employment
agreements covering Company Employees as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and set forth on Schedule
3.1(r)(i).

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees credit for such Company
Employees’ service with the Company for purposes of eligibility and vesting (other than vesting of future equity awards)
and for purposes of determining future vacation accruals and severance amounts under any benefit plans maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation in which a Company Employee participates to the same extent and for the same
purpose as recognized by the Company and the analogous Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to take commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) waive any
preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company Employees and their eligible dependents under any
plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates that provides health benefits in which Company Employees participate following
the Closing, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees as of the Closing Date under
the analogous Company Benefit Plan; (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by
the Company Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately
prior to the Closing Date during the portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles,
co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent or any of its Affiliates in which they are eligible to
participate after the Closing Date in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket
maximums were incurred; and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that
would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing Date,
in each case to the extent such Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date.

(e) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any right in any employee of the Company to continued
employment by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment or service of any employee or other Person for any reason; (ii)
require Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Company Benefit Plans or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Closing Date; (iii) confer upon any Company Employee or
other Person any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, including any right as a third party

the part of the Company, Parent, MergerSub or any of their respective Affiliates, or any of their respective
managers, directors, stockholders, members, partners, officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors or

Agreement.

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 6.1(a)(vii) or 6.1(a)(viii), the Company will pay to

Transaction pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Parent. For purposes of this Section 6.1(b)(iii), all references to “20%” in the definition of
“Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50%.”

(iv) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 6.1(a)(v) or 6.1(a)(ix), Parent will pay to the Company
or its designee (as directed by the Company) the Parent Termination Fee. If the Parent Termination Fee is payable,
such Parent Termination Fee shall be paid no later than the second (2nd) Business Day after termination of this
Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company, it being
understood that in no event shall the Parent Termination Fee be payable on more than one occasion, whether or not
the Parent Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and upon the occurrence of different events. Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 6.1(b)(iv) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails to pay the Parent
Termination Fee when due and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company or any of its Affiliates commences a
suit or other Action that results in a judgment against Parent for the Parent Termination Fee or any portion thereof,
Parent shall pay to the Company the costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) of
the Company or such Affiliate in connection with such suit or other Action, together with interest on such amount or
portion thereof at the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

(v) After termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 6.1(a)(vii) or Section 6.1(a)(viii), Parent’s right to
receive payment of the Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to Section 6.1(b) shall, upon full
payment to Parent of the Company Termination Fee, be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, MergerSub,
Guarantor and their respective Affiliates, former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons,
managers, directors, stockholders, optionholders members, general or limited partners, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Financing Sources, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the “Parent Related Parties”)
against the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, managers, directors, shareholders,

relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or as a result of any breach of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document or any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein

 Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or as a result of any breach
of this Agreement or any Transaction Document or any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein or therein by Parent, MergerSub or any other Parent Related Party, and upon payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, to the extent owed to the Company under this Agreement, (A) none of the Parent Related Parties
will have any further liability or obligation to the Company relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any
Transaction Documents (including the Commitment Letters) or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or
any matters forming the basis for such termination, and (B) neither the Company nor any other Person will be
entitled to bring or maintain any Action against Parent, MergerSub or any other Parent Related Party arising out of
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents (including the Commitment Letters), the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination; provided, however, that such parties shall
remain obligated for, and the Company shall be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement,
and Parent shall remain obligated for, and the Company shall be entitled to remedies with respect to, the
reimbursement and expense obligations of Parent contained in Sections 5.4 and 5.11(d), and the last sentence of
Section.

(vii) Each party acknowledges that (A) the agreements contained in Section 6.1(b) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee are payable are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation and, therefore, each of the Company Termination and Parent Termination Fee is
not a penalty but rather constitutes liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this
Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) without
these agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement.

(c) Following any termination of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive and remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Nothing in this Section 6.1 shall be deemed to impair the right of
any party to bring any action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (including
the right of any party to compel specific performance by another party of its obligations under this Agreement)
pursuant to, and subject to the limitations set forth in, Section 7.16 prior to the valid termination of this Agreement,
except that, although the Company, in its sole discretion, may determine its choice of remedies hereunder, including
by pursuing specific performance in accordance with, but subject to the limitations of, Section 7.18(a), under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both specific performance of the type
contemplated by Section 7.18(a) and any monetary damages, including the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this
Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, under no circumstances will the collective
monetary damages payable by Parent, MergerSub or any of their Affiliates for breaches under this Agreement or the
Commitment Letters (taking into account the payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement)
exceed an amount equal to $8,264,000 (the “Parent Liability Limitation”). In no event will any of the Company
Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person acting on their
behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery, fee or award in
excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against any of the Parent Related Parties, and in no event will the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including consequential,
special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against the Parent Related Parties
for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(including, any breach by the Guarantor, Parent or MergerSub), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under

the Equity Commitment Letter and other than the obligations of Parent and MergerSub to the extent expressly
provided in this Agreement, in no event will any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than Parent and
MergerSub have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or any other Person relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Merger.

Section 7.9 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, each party hereto will bear its own

and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that Parent shall be responsible for (a) all Transfer Taxes (as well as the
filing of all Tax Returns with respect thereto) and (b) all filing fees in connection with any filings, applications or
submissions under the HSR Act and any other applicable competition Law).

Section 7.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules hereto) and the other
Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements, representations, warranties, promises, statements and understandings between the parties
with respect to such subject matter; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not supersede the terms and provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive and remain in effect until expiration or termination thereof in accordance
with its terms and this Agreement.

Section 7.11 Interpretation. When a reference is made to an Article, Section, subsection, clause, Schedule, Annex or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article, Section, subsection, clause, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit of or to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, such words
shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” Any references to the masculine, feminine or neuter
gender shall include such other genders and any references to the singular or plural shall include the other, in each case unless
the context otherwise requires. Any reference to this “Agreement” or any other agreement, document or other contract
referred to herein or on any annex, schedule or exhibit hereto shall be construed as a reference to this Agreement or, as the
case may be, such other agreement, document or contract, as the same may have been, or may from time to time be,
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, together with all annexes, schedules and exhibits to this Agreement or such
other agreement, document or contract (as the case may be), in each case unless the reference specifically provides otherwise.
The terms “Dollars” and “$” mean United States Dollars, and all payments to be made by Parent, MergerSub or the Company
under or pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be made in United States Dollars. Information, documents and
materials relating to the Shareholders, the Awardholders, the Warrantholders, the Company or its Subsidiaries or any other

established by the Company at http://us1.merrillcorp.com at least one (1) day prior to the date of this Agreement. If any
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties

of the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 7.12 Disclosure. Any exception, qualification or other disclosure set forth on the Company Disclosure
Schedules with respect to a particular representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be

reasonably apparent on its face that such exception, qualification or disclosure is applicable to

such other representations, warranties or covenants whether or not such exception, qualification or disclosure makes
reference to such other representations, warranties or covenants or any of their Section references. The inclusion of
information in any of the Company Disclosure Schedules shall not be construed as an admission that such information is
material to the Business, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 7.13 Waiver and Amendment. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended, supplemented, waived or
modified if, and only if, any such amendment, supplement or modification is in writing and signed by the Company and
Parent, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that after execution of the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Shareholders, no amendment shall be made that by Law requires further
approval by the Shareholders without obtaining such required approval under the WBCL. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the provisions relating to the Financing Sources set forth in Section 6.1(b),
Section 6.1(d), Section 7.3, Section 7.5, Section 7.15, Section 7.17 or Section 7.18 (and in each case, the defined terms used
or defined therein) be amended, modified or altered without the prior written consent of such Financing Sources.

Section 7.14 Counterparts; Facsimile and PDF Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when executed, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together will be deemed to be
one and the same instrument binding upon all of the parties hereto notwithstanding the fact that all parties are not signatory to
the original or the same counterpart. For purposes of this Agreement, facsimile and portable document format signatures shall
be deemed originals.

Section 7.15 Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein, express or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any other
Person any legal or equitable rights hereunder, except that (a) each Company Indemnitee shall be a third party beneficiary of
Section 5.6, (b) each Company Related Party shall be a third party beneficiary of Section 6.1(b)(v), (c) each Parent Related
Party shall be a third party beneficiary of Section 6.1(b)(vi) and Section 6.1(d), and (d) any party listed in Section 7.17(b)
shall be a third party beneficiary of Section 7.17(b). The provisions of Section 6.1(b), Section 6.1(d), Section 7.3, Section 7.5,
Section 7.15, Section 7.17 and Section 7.18 will inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and their successors and
permitted assigns, each of whom are intended to be third party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and agreed that the
provisions of such Sections will be enforceable by the Financing Sources and their respective successors and permitted
assigns).

Section 7.16 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or
circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof. The Parties further agree to replace such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

Section 7.17 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against the named parties hereto (subject to the
terms, conditions and other limitations set forth herein), and (a) all claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, the termination of this
Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or any claims or actions under applicable Laws
arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, may be made only against the Persons that are expressly identified as
parties hereto and (b) no past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, general or limited
partner, stockholder, Financing Source, controlling person, Optionholder, RSUholder, Warrantholder, trustee, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, successors and assigns or representative of any party hereto (including any person negotiating or executing this
Agreement on behalf of a party hereto) shall have any liability or obligation with

respect to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or with respect to any claim or cause of action that may
arise out of or relate to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7.17 shall be deemed to alter, modify, replace or limit the terms,
provisions and agreements set forth in Section 7.1. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Financing
Sources will have any liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or otherwise, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder (provided that nothing
herein shall limit the rights of the Company and its Affiliates from and after the Effective Time under any Debt Commitment
Letter or Definitive Financing Arrangements (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement) to the extent the Company
and/or such Affiliate(s) are party thereto).

Section 7.18 Specific Performance.

(a) The Company, Parent and MergerSub acknowledge and agree that (a) irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached or threatened to be breached, and (b) remedies at law would not be adequate to compensate the non-
breaching party. Accordingly, each of the Company, Parent and MergerSub agree that, prior to any valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1 and subject in all respects to this Section 7.18, each of them shall have
the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce its rights hereunder not only by an
action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable
relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. The right to equitable relief,
including specific performance and injunctive relief, shall exist notwithstanding, and shall not be limited by, any other
provision of this Agreement except as provided in this Section 7.18 and, following a termination of this Agreement, in
Section 6.1(b). Each of the Company, Parent and MergerSub hereby waives any defense that a remedy at law is adequate
and any requirement to post bond or other security in connection with actions instituted for injunctive relief, specific
performance or other equitable remedies. Each of the Company, Parent and MergerSub hereby agrees not to assert that
specific performance, injunctive and other equitable remedies are unenforceable, violate public policy, are invalid, are
contrary to Law or are inequitable for any reason. The right of specific performance, injunctive and other equitable
remedies is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of the
Company, Parent or MergerSub would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else
to the contrary, the parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that the Company shall only be entitled to specific
performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to cause Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in accordance with Article II, if (i) all conditions in Section 4.1
(other than those conditions which are to be satisfied only on the Closing Date but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions) have been satisfied or waived, (ii) Parent fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.8(a), (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent
that (A) if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing or Alternative Debt Financing and the Equity
Financing were funded, then it will take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to
occur, and (B) the Company is prepared, willing and able to effect the Closing, and (iv) the Debt Financing (or
Alternative Debt Financing) has been funded, or will be funded at the Closing (if the Equity Financing is funded), or the
Financing Sources have irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that the Debt Financing will be funded and available
at the Closing (if the Equity Financing is funded).

(b) Without limiting the obligations of the Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter and the rights of
Parent and MergerSub under the Debt Commitment Letter, the Company acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall
the Company be entitled to seek a

 remedy of specific performance or other equitable remedies against any lender-related party (including such Financing
Sources and its respective Affiliates, and the respective officers, directors, employees, partners, trustees, stockholders,
controlling persons, agents and representatives of the foregoing, and their respective successors and assigns).

Section 7.19 Limited Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to comply with Treas.
Reg. Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(i), the Company, the Shareholders, the Optionholders and Parent (and any employee,
representative or other agent of the foregoing) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the United
States federal income tax treatment and structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including opinions or
other tax analyses that are provided to any of them relating to such tax treatment and tax structure). However, any such
information relating to the tax treatment or tax structure is required to be kept confidential to the extent necessary to comply
with any applicable federal or state securities laws. For this purpose, tax treatment and tax structure shall not include (a) the
name of, or any other identifying information regarding the Shareholders, the Awardholders or Parent (or any affiliate
thereof), (b) any specific pricing information or (c) other nonpublic business or financial information (including, without
limitation, the amount of any fees, expenses, rates or payments) that is not relevant to an understanding of the tax treatment
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Board of Directors
ARI Network Services, Inc.
10850 West Park Place, Suite 1200
Milwaukee, WI 53224

Members of the Board of Directors:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders (other than Expedition
Holdings LLC (“Expedition”) and its affiliates) of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $.001 par value per
share (the “Common Stock”) of ARI Network Services, Inc. (the “Company”) of the consideration to be paid to these holders
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 20, 2017 (the “Merger Agreement”) to be entered into by and
among the Company, Expedition Holdings LLC and Expedition Merger Sub, Inc. (“MergerSub”), a subsidiary of Expedition
(the “Transaction”).

You have advised us that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Common
Stock will be converted into the right to receive $7.10 in cash per share. The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more
fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

Pacific Crest Securities, a division of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. (“PCS”), as part of its investment banking business,
is customarily engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes.

In connection with rendering this opinion, we have reviewed and analyzed, among other things, the following: (i) a draft
of the Merger Agreement, dated June 19, 2017, which we understand to be in substantially final form; (ii) certain publicly
available information concerning the Company, including the Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for each of the
years in the three-year period ended July 31, 2016, and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company for the quarters
ended April 30, 2017, January 31, 2017 and October 31, 2016; (iii) certain other internal information, primarily financial in
nature, including projections, concerning the business and operations of the Company furnished to us by the Company for
purposes of our analysis; (iv) certain publicly available information concerning the trading of, and the trading market for, the
Common Stock; (v) certain publicly available information concerning True Wind Capital, L.P., an affiliate of Expedition
(“True Wind”), and its financing sources; (vi) certain publicly available information with respect to certain other publicly
traded companies that we believe to be comparable to the Company and the trading markets for certain of such other
companies’ securities; and (viii) certain publicly available information concerning the nature and terms of certain other
transactions that we consider relevant to our inquiry. We have also met with certain officers and employees of the Company
to discuss the business, financial condition, operations and prospects of the Company, as well as other matters we believed
relevant to our inquiry. We have also performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other data and
information as we deemed appropriate.

In our review and analysis and in arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial and other information provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us or
publicly available, and we have assumed that the representations and warranties of the Company, Expedition and MergerSub
contained in the Merger Agreement are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We have not been
engaged to, and have not independently attempted to, verify any of such information or its accuracy or completeness. We
have also relied upon the management of the Company as to the reasonableness and achievability of the financial and
operating projections (and the assumptions and bases therefor)

provided to us and, with your consent, we have assumed that such projections were reasonably prepared on bases that reflect
the best currently available estimates and judgments of management of the Company of the future financial performance of
the Company and other matters covered thereby. We have not been engaged to assess the reasonableness or achievability of
such projections or the assumptions on which they were based, and we express no view as to such projections or assumptions.
In addition, we have not conducted a physical inspection, valuation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities of the
Company nor have we been furnished with any such inspection, valuation or appraisal. We have also assumed that all
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained
without any adverse effect on the Company or the Transaction that would be meaningful to our analysis.

We have not been asked to, nor do we, offer any opinion as to the material terms of the Merger Agreement or the form of
the Transaction. In rendering our opinion, we have assumed, with your consent, that the final executed form of the Merger
Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft that we have examined, and that the conditions to the
Transaction as set forth in the Merger Agreement will be satisfied and that the Transaction will be consummated on a timely
basis on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without waiver or modification of any term or condition that would be
meaningful to our analysis.

It should be noted that this opinion is based on economic and market conditions and other circumstances existing on, and
information made available to us as of, the date hereof and does not address any matters subsequent to such date. In addition,
our opinion is, in any event, limited to the fairness, as of the date hereof, from a financial point of view, of the consideration
to be paid to the holders of the Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement and does not address the Company’s
underlying business decision to engage in the Transaction or any other terms of the Transaction or the fairness of the
Transaction, or any consideration paid in connection therewith, to creditors or other constituencies of the Company. In
addition, we do not express any opinion as to the fairness of the Transaction or the amount or the nature of the compensation
now paid or to be paid to any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, relative to the
consideration to be paid to public shareholders of the Company. We do not express any opinion as to the impact of the
Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company, Expedition or its affiliates or the ability of the Company, Expedition
or its affiliates to pay their respective obligations when they come due. It should be noted that although subsequent
developments may affect this opinion, we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm our opinion. This opinion
has been approved by a fairness committee of PCS.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and have participated in certain of the
negotiations leading to, the Transaction and will receive from the Company a fee for our services, a significant portion of
which is contingent upon the consummation of the Transaction (the “Transaction Fee”). In addition, the Company has agreed
to reimburse us for certain expenses and to indemnify us under certain circumstances for certain liabilities that may arise out
of our engagement. We also will receive a fee in connection with the delivery of this opinion, which fee will be credited
against any Transaction Fee earned. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates, employees of us and our
affiliates, and funds or other entities that such persons manage or invest in or have other economic interests or with which
they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives,
loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Expedition, any of their
respective affiliates and third parties, including True Wind, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the
Transaction, in each case for our own account or for the accounts of customers. We may in the future provide financial
advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company and its affiliates and to True Wind and its affiliates and portfolio
companies for which we may receive compensation.

It is understood that this opinion was prepared solely for the confidential use of the Board of Directors of the Company
in connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the proposed Transaction. This opinion letter is not to be used,
circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose, nor is it to be filed with, included in or referred to in whole
or in part in any registration statement, proxy statement or any other document, except in accordance with our prior written
consent. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder
should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that as of the date hereof, the $7.10 in cash per share to be paid
to the holders (other than Expedition and its affiliates) of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders.

Very truly yours,
