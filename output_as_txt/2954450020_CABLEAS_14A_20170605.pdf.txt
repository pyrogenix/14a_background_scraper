Dear Fellow Stockholder:

A special meeting of stockholders of Cabela’s Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (which we refer to as the “Company”), will
be held on July 11, 2017, at 8:00 a.m. local time, at the Company’s corporate headquarters, One Cabela Drive, Sidney, Nebraska
69160. You are cordially invited to attend. The purpose of the meeting is to consider and vote on proposals relating to the proposed
acquisition of the Company by Bass Pro Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (which we refer to as “Parent”), for $61.50
in cash per share, without interest thereon, subject to certain adjustments should the bank framework agreement (as described in the
accompanying proxy statement) be validly terminated in certain circumstances, subject to any applicable withholding taxes. Regardless
of whether you plan to attend the meeting, we encourage you to vote your shares by mail, by telephone or through the Internet by
following the procedures outlined below.

On October 3, 2016, the Company, Parent and Prairie Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent (which we refer to as “Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (which we refer to as the “original merger
agreement” and, as amended as described below and further amended from time to time, which we refer to as the “merger
agreement”). On April 17, 2017, the Company, Parent and Sub amended the original merger agreement by entering into the
Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger (which we refer to as the “merger agreement amendment”). The merger agreement
provides for, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, the acquisition of the Company by Parent at a price of $61.50
per share in cash, without interest thereon, subject to certain adjustments should the bank framework agreement be validly terminated
in certain circumstances, subject to any applicable withholding taxes. Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Sub
will be merged with and into the Company (which we refer to as the “merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving
corporation in the merger. As a result of the merger, the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. At the special
meeting, the Company will ask you to adopt the merger agreement.

At the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as the “effective time”), each share of Class A common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (which we refer to as “Company common stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time (other than (i) shares of Company common stock that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any
subsidiary of the Company and all shares owned of record by Parent, Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, in each case
immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) shares of Company common stock held by stockholders who have not voted in favor of,
or consented to the adoption of, the merger agreement and who have properly demanded appraisal of such shares and complied in all
respects with all the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law concerning the right of holders of shares to request appraisal
of their shares) will be cancelled, extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive $61.50 in cash per share, without
interest thereon, subject to certain adjustments should the bank framework agreement be validly terminated in certain circumstances,
subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

The proxy statement accompanying this letter provides you with more specific information concerning the special meeting, the
merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. We encourage you to carefully read
the accompanying proxy statement and the copy of the merger agreement attached as Annex A to the proxy statement, which reflects
the effect of the merger agreement amendment.

The board of directors of the Company (which we refer to as the “Board”) carefully reviewed and considered the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. By a unanimous
vote, the Board (i) adopted and declared advisable the merger agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, (ii) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance of
the merger agreement, and subject to receiving the required approval from Company stockholders, the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, (iii) determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
(iv) directed that a proposal to adopt the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of Company stockholders and
(v) resolved to recommend that Company stockholders vote for the adoption of the merger agreement. Accordingly, the Board
unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Your vote is important. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting and regardless of the number of shares you own,
your careful consideration of, and vote on, the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is important, and we encourage you to vote
promptly. The merger cannot be completed unless the merger agreement is adopted by stockholders holding at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter. The failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

After reading the accompanying proxy statement, please make sure to vote your shares promptly by completing, signing and
dating the accompanying proxy card and returning it in the enclosed prepaid envelope or by voting by telephone or through the Internet
by following the instructions on the accompanying proxy card. Instructions regarding all three methods of voting are provided on the
proxy card. If you hold shares through an account with a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, please follow the instructions you
receive from it to vote your shares.

Thank you in advance for your continued support and your consideration of this matter.
 

Sincerely,

Thomas L. Millner
Chief Executive Officer

Neither the United States Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or
disapproved the merger, passed upon the merits or fairness of the merger or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the
disclosure in this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

The accompanying proxy statement is dated June 3, 2017 and is being mailed to Company stockholders on or about June 7, 2017.

SUMMARY TERM SHEET

This summary highlights certain information in this proxy statement, but may not contain all of the information that may
be important to you. You should carefully read this entire proxy statement and the attached Annexes and the other documents to
which this proxy statement refers you for a more complete understanding of the matters being considered at the special meeting. In
addition, this proxy statement incorporates by reference important business and financial information about Cabela’s
Incorporated. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the
instructions in the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 153. Unless the context otherwise indicates,
we refer to Cabela’s Incorporated as “Cabela’s,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.”

The Parties (see page 25)

Cabela’s Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, is a leading specialty retailer and the world’s largest direct marketer of
hunting, fishing, camping and related outdoor merchandise. Since our founding in 1961, the Company has become one of the most
well-known outdoor recreation brands in the world and we have long been recognized as the “World’s Foremost Outfitter®.”
Through our growing number of retail stores and our well-established direct business, we believe we offer the widest and most
distinctive selection of high-quality outdoor products at competitive prices, while providing superior customer service. The
Company’s principal executive offices are located at One Cabela Drive, Sidney, Nebraska 69160 and our telephone number is
(308) 254-5505.

Bass Pro Group, LLC (which we refer to as “Parent”) is a privately-held Delaware limited liability company that serves
as the holding company for the operations of Bass Pro Shops, White River Marine Group and Big Cedar Lodge. Bass Pro Shops
was founded in 1972 and is a leading national retailer of outdoor gear and apparel. White River Marine Group is a manufacturer
and retailer of recreational boats with industry-leading brands including Tracker Boats, Sun Tracker, Nitro, Tahoe, Regency, Mako,
Ranger, Triton and Stratos. Big Cedar Lodge, America’s Premier Wilderness Resort, welcomes more than one million guests
annually to Missouri’s Ozark Mountains. Parent and its businesses employ approximately 20,000 team members. Parent’s principal
executive offices are located at 2500 East Kearney, Springfield, Missouri 65898 and its telephone number is (417) 831-2802.

Prairie Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (which we refer to as “Sub”), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent,
formed on September 30, 2016, solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (as
described below). Sub has not carried on any activities on or prior to the date of this proxy statement, except for activities
incidental to its formation and activities undertaken in connection with Parent’s proposed acquisition of the Company. Sub’s
principal executive offices are located at 2500 East Kearney, Springfield, Missouri 65898 and its telephone number is
(417) 831-2802.

The Merger (see page 34)

On October 3, 2016, the Company, Parent and Sub entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (which we refer to as
the “original merger agreement” and, as amended as described below and further amended from time to time, which we refer to as
the “merger agreement”). On April 17, 2017, the Company, Parent and Sub amended the original merger agreement by entering
into the Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger (which we refer to as the “merger agreement amendment”). Except as
otherwise specified, all references in this proxy statement to the “merger agreement” are references to the original merger
agreement as it has been amended by the merger agreement amendment, and as it may be further amended from time to time.

In connection with the entry into the bank sale agreements (as described below), the Company, Parent and Sub amended
the original merger agreement by entering into the merger agreement amendment setting forth,

Table of Contents

among other things, the merger consideration as described herein, which reflects a reduction from that set forth in the original
merger agreement, except in certain circumstances. For more information about the background of and reasons for the merger
agreement amendment, see the sections entitled “The Merger—Background of the Merger,” beginning on page 34, and “The
Merger—Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement,” beginning on page 64.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Sub will merge
with and into the Company (which we refer to as the “merger”), whereupon the separate existence of Sub will cease and the
Company will continue as the surviving corporation (which we refer to as the “surviving corporation”) and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent.

At the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as the “effective time”), except as described below, each share of
Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (which we refer to as “Company common stock”) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than (i) shares of Company common stock that are held in the treasury of
the Company or owned of record by any subsidiary of the Company and all shares owned of record by Parent, Sub or any of their
respective subsidiaries, in each case immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) shares of Company common stock held by
stockholders who have not voted in favor of, or consented to the adoption of, the merger agreement and who have properly
demanded appraisal of such shares and complied in all respects with all the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law
(which we refer to as the “DGCL”) concerning the right of holders of shares to request appraisal of their shares) will be cancelled
and automatically converted into the right to receive $61.50 per share in cash, without interest thereon, subject to any applicable
withholding taxes and the following paragraph.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger consideration will be adjusted as follows in the event that the bank
framework agreement (as described below) among the Company, Synovus Bank, a Georgia state member bank (which we refer to
as “Synovus”) and Capital One Bank (USA), National Association, a national banking association (which we refer to as “Capital
One”) is validly terminated, although the merger agreement provides that the merger cannot close until the financial services
business (as described below) has been sold and the bank framework agreement can only be terminated in certain circumstances, as
described in the section entitled “The Bank Sale Agreements—Termination Rights; Effect of Termination,” beginning on page 134:
 

 

•  in the event that the bank framework agreement is validly terminated by Synovus in accordance with its terms and
the original bank purchase agreement (as described below) is automatically deemed to be re-executed in its
original form pursuant to the terms thereof, as further described below, then the merger consideration to be paid
by Parent if the closing of the sale of the financial services business and the closing of the merger occurs will be
$62.50 per share in cash, without interest thereon; and

 

 
•  in the event that the bank framework agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms such that none

of the original bank purchase agreement, the bank framework agreement and the credit card program agreement
(as described below) remains in effect pursuant to the terms thereof, then either, at the Company’s election,

 

 

•  such merger consideration to be paid by Parent if the closing of the sale of the financial services
business and the closing of the merger occurs will be $65.50 per share in cash, without interest thereon,
and the Company will generally be restricted from entering into an alternative transaction with respect
to the financial services business on terms that are materially less favorable than those of the original
bank purchase agreement and the credit card program agreement, in its original form without giving
effect to any amendments thereto, without Parent’s prior written consent or

bank purchase agreement and the credit card program agreement, as amended, without Parent’s prior
written consent.

The applicable merger consideration to be paid by Parent in the merger as described in this paragraph and the immediately
preceding paragraph is referred to herein as the “merger consideration”.

Following the completion of the merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

The Bank Sale Agreements (see page 131)

In connection with the merger agreement amendment, the Company entered into (i) a Framework Agreement, dated as
of April 17, 2017 (which we refer to as the “bank framework agreement”), by and among the Company, World’s Foremost Bank, a
Nebraska banking corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (which we refer to as “WFB”), Synovus, Capital One
and, solely for the purposes set forth therein, Capital One, National Association, a national banking association and affiliate of
Capital One (which we refer to as “CONA”), (ii) an Asset and Deposit Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2017 (which we
refer to as the “Synovus bank asset purchase agreement”), by and among the Company, WFB and Synovus and (iii) an Asset
Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2017 (which we refer to as the “Capital One bank asset purchase agreement”), by and
among the Company, WFB and Capital One. Synovus and Capital One also entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of
April 17, 2017 (which we refer to as the “third party bank asset purchase agreement”). We refer to the bank framework
agreement, the Synovus bank asset purchase agreement, the Capital One bank asset purchase agreement and the third party bank
asset purchase agreement, collectively, as the “bank sale agreements”. The bank sale agreements provide for, in connection with
the closing of the merger, the sale of the business of WFB (which we refer to as the “financial services business”). Pursuant to the
bank sale agreements, by way of three transactions, (i) Synovus has agreed to acquire assets and assume liabilities of WFB, which
collectively constitute substantially all of the business of WFB, (ii) Capital One has agreed to acquire certain other assets and
assume certain other liabilities of WFB and (iii) immediately following the transaction referred to in the foregoing clause (i),
Synovus has agreed to sell and assign to Capital One, and Capital One has agreed to acquire and assume, certain of such assets and
liabilities acquired and assumed by Synovus from WFB, such that Synovus retains all deposits of WFB and certain other assets and
liabilities relating to deposits of WFB and Capital One acquires the assets and liabilities relating to the Cabela’s CLUB co-branded
credit card accounts and equity interests in certain securitization funding vehicles.

The bank sale agreements amended and restated the Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 3, 2016 (which
we refer to as the “original bank purchase agreement”), by and among the Company, WFB and CONA, with Synovus acceding as
a party thereto and Capital One novated for CONA as a party thereto. You are not being asked to vote on or adopt any of the bank
sale agreements. See the section entitled “The Bank Sale Agreements,” beginning on page 131.

The Voting Agreements (see page 140)

In connection with the merger agreement, each of the directors of the Company, who collectively beneficially owned an
aggregate of 13,261,189 shares of Company common stock as of October 3, 2016, representing approximately 18.52% of the
shares of Company common stock outstanding as of that date, entered into a voting agreement with Parent, Sub and the Company

a stockholder and do not limit or restrict such signatory thereto from acting in his or her capacity as a director in such person’s
discretion on any matter. A copy of the form of voting agreement executed by all directors other than James W. Cabela and Dennis
Highby is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Forms of the voting agreements executed by James W. Cabela and Dennis

Recommendation of the Board; Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement (see page 64)

After careful consideration, the Board unanimously declared the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger, to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Accordingly, the
Board unanimously recommends that at the special meeting you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement,
“FOR” the approval, by a non-binding advisory vote, of compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers and that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the merger and “FOR” the proposal to
adjourn the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies.

For a discussion of the material factors considered by the Board in reaching its conclusions, see the section entitled “The
Merger—Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement,” beginning on page 64. In addition, in considering
the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that members of the Board and our
executive officers have certain interests in the merger that may be in addition to, or different from, the interests of Company
stockholders generally. See the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,”
beginning on page 87.

Opinion of Our Financial Advisor (see page 71)

The Company retained Guggenheim Securities, LLC (which we refer to as “Guggenheim Securities”) as its financial
advisor in connection with the merger. Guggenheim Securities delivered an opinion to the Board to the effect that, as of April 17,
2017 and based on and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of
and qualifications to the review undertaken, the merger consideration to be received in the merger by holders of Company common
stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For purposes of Guggenheim Securities’ analyses and opinion, the
term “merger consideration” refers to the $61.50 per share merger consideration. The full text of Guggenheim Securities’ written
opinion, which is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement and which you should read carefully and in its entirety, is subject to
the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other conditions contained in such opinion and is necessarily based on economic,
capital markets and other conditions, and the information made available to Guggenheim Securities, as of the date of such opinion.

Guggenheim Securities’ opinion was provided to the Board (in its capacity as such) for its information and assistance in
connection with its evaluation of the merger consideration. Guggenheim Securities’ opinion and any materials provided in
connection therewith did not constitute a recommendation to the Board with respect to the merger or any related transactions, nor
does Guggenheim Securities’ opinion constitute advice or a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act in
connection with the merger, any related transactions or otherwise. Guggenheim Securities’ opinion addressed only the fairness,
from a financial point of view and as of the date of such opinion, of the merger consideration to the extent expressly specified in
such opinion and Guggenheim Securities did not express any view or opinion as to any other term, aspect or

limitation, the form or structure of the merger, any adjustments to the merger consideration, the form or structure, or financial or
other terms of, any related transactions, any terms, aspects or implications of any related agreements or voting or other agreement,
transaction document or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or to be entered into or amended in connection with the
merger or any related transactions.

For a description of the opinion that the Board received from Guggenheim Securities, see the section entitled “The
Merger — Opinion of Our Financial Advisor” beginning on page 71.

Market Price and Dividend Data (see page 146)

Company common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (which we refer to as the “NYSE”) under the
symbol “CAB.” On September 30, 2016, the last full trading day prior to the public announcement of the entry into the original
merger agreement, the closing price for Company common stock was $54.93 per share. On March 28, 2017, the last full trading
day prior to certain reports of a revised transaction with Capital One and Synovus appeared in the news media, the closing price for
Company common stock was $46.25 per share. On April 17, 2017, the last full trading day prior to the public announcement of the
entry into the merger agreement amendment, the closing price for Company common stock was $53.69 per share. On June 2, 2017,
the last full trading day prior to the date of this proxy statement, the closing price for Company common stock was $53.53 per
share.

Certain Effects of the Merger (see page 95)

Upon completion of the merger, Sub will be merged with and into the Company upon the terms set forth in the merger
agreement. As the surviving corporation in the merger, the Company will continue to exist following the merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent.

Following the completion of the merger, shares of Company common stock will no longer be traded on the NYSE or any
other public market. In addition, the registration of shares of Company common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”), will be terminated.

Consequences if the Merger is Not Completed (see page 96)

If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement does not receive the required approval from Company stockholders, or if
the merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not receive any consideration from Parent or Sub for your shares of
Company common stock. Instead, the Company will remain a public company and Company common stock will continue to be
listed and traded on the NYSE.

The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements is subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of specified conditions set forth in the merger agreement. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement does not receive the
required approval from Company stockholders or the merger agreement is otherwise terminated, the transactions contemplated by
the bank sale agreements may not be consummated.

In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, the Company is required to pay Parent
a termination fee of $126,000,000 (which we refer to as the “Company termination fee”). Upon termination of the merger
agreement under certain specified circumstances, Parent is obligated to pay the Company a termination fee of $230,000,000 (which
we refer to as the “Parent termination fee”). In the event that the bank sale agreements are terminated under certain specified
circumstances in which the Company termination fee is payable by the Company to Parent under the merger agreement, Capital
One will be entitled to receive from the Company a termination fee of $14,000,000. In the event that the bank sale agreements are

terminated after the Company and Parent mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement and, in connection with the
termination, Parent receives any payment or fee from the Company, Capital One will be entitled to receive from the Company a
termination fee of 10% of the aggregate payment or fee received by Parent from the Company. In the event that the bank sale
agreements are terminated under certain specified circumstances (including in certain specified circumstances after the merger
agreement is terminated), Synovus will be entitled to receive from Capital One a termination fee of $10,000,000, plus the amount
of certain costs and expenses. In certain circumstances, WFB is obligated to reimburse Capital One for up to $10,000,000 of such
termination fee and such costs and expenses paid to Synovus. See the sections entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—
Expenses; Termination Fees,” beginning on page 127 and “The Bank Sale Agreements—Termination Rights; Effect of
Termination,” beginning on page 134.

Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards and Equity Plans (see page 107)

The merger agreement provides that, as of immediately prior to the effective time:
 

 

•  each option to purchase shares of Company common stock granted under any of the Company’s equity incentive
stock plans (which, each, we refer to as a “Company option”) that is then outstanding will be fully vested and
cancelled by virtue of the merger and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company option
will be entitled to receive a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
Company common stock subject to such cancelled Company option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger
consideration over the exercise price per share subject to such cancelled Company option, without interest (the
“option payment”); provided, however, that (A) any such Company option with respect to which the exercise
price per share subject thereto is equal or greater than the merger consideration will be cancelled in exchange for
no consideration and (B) the option payment will be reduced by the amount of any required tax withholdings as
contemplated by the merger agreement; and

 

 

•  each outstanding award of restricted stock units of the Company (which, each, we refer to as an “RSU award”)
that is then outstanding will be fully vested (with any performance conditions applicable to such RSU award
deemed satisfied in full) and cancelled by virtue of the merger and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such
cancelled RSU award will be entitled to receive a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company common stock subject to such cancelled RSU award and (ii) the merger
consideration; provided, however, that such cash payment will be reduced by the amount of any required tax
withholdings as contemplated by the merger agreement.

The merger agreement provides that, (a) as of the effective time, the Company’s 2004 Stock Plan, the Company’s 2013
Stock Plan, and the inducement grant program established by the Company will be terminated and (b) as of immediately prior to
the effective time, the Company’s 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be terminated.

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 87)

Members of the Board and our executive officers have certain interests in the merger that may be in addition to, or
different from, the interests of Company stockholders generally. You should keep this in mind when considering the
recommendation of the Board that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. The members of the Board were
aware of these interests and considered them at the time they approved the merger agreement and in making their recommendation
that Company stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. See the section entitled “The Merger—
Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 87.

(and any extension thereof) applicable to the completion of the merger under the HSR Act and (ii) the absence of any order,
verdict, decision, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, rule, ruling, directive, stipulation, determination or award by a governmental
entity of competent jurisdiction that is in effect and renders the merger illegal, or prohibits, enjoins or otherwise prevents the
merger. Under the bank sale agreements, the obligations of Capital One, Synovus, the Company and WFB are subject to, among
other things, (i) approval by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (which we refer to as the “FRB”) of a Bank Merger
Act (which we refer to as “BMA”) application filed by Synovus with respect to the transactions contemplated by the bank sale

respective obligations under the merger agreement with respect to regulatory approvals, see the section entitled “The Agreement
and Plan of Merger—Efforts to Complete the Merger,” beginning on page 118 and the section entitled “The Bank Sale Agreements
—Closing Conditions,” beginning on page 132.

Financing of the Merger (see page 97)

We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the merger, including the funds needed to pay Company
stockholders and holders of other equity-based interests the amounts due to them under the merger agreement, which would be
approximately $4.584 billion based upon the number of shares of Company common stock (and our other equity-based interests)
outstanding as of May 17, 2017, will be funded through a portion of the proceeds from up to approximately $5.145 billion of debt
financing and a portion of the proceeds from up to approximately $2.383 billion of preferred equity financing. Parent has entered
into a preferred financing commitment letter, dated as of October 3, 2016 (which we refer to as the “preferred financing
commitment letter”), from Broad Street Principal Investments, L.L.C. (which we refer to as “Broad Street”) and Pamplona Capital
Partners IV, L.P. (which we refer to as “Pamplona”) (which, collectively, we refer to as the “preferred equity financing
commitment parties”), which obligates the preferred equity financing commitment parties to fund to Parent an aggregate amount
of $2,382,740,000, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the preferred financing commitment letter, for the purpose of
enabling Parent to fund a portion of the merger consideration. Parent has also entered into a debt commitment letter, dated as of
October 3, 2016 (which we refer to as the “debt commitment letter”), with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
(which we refer to as “MLPFS”), Bank of America, N.A. (which we refer to as “Bank of America”), Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
(which we refer to as “Wells Fargo Securities”), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (which we refer to as “Wells Fargo
Bank”), Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (which we refer to as “Citigroup”), Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC (which we refer
to as “GSLP”), RBC Capital Markets (which we refer to as “RBCCM”), Royal Bank of Canada (which we refer to as “Royal
Bank”), UBS Securities LLC (which we refer to as “UBSS”) and UBS AG, Stamford Branch (which we refer to as “UBS AG”
and, together with MLPFS, Bank of America, Wells Fargo Securities, Wells Fargo Bank, Citigroup, GSLP, RBCCM, Royal Bank
and UBSS, the “debt commitment parties”) as commitment parties thereunder. Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the debt
commitment letter, the debt commitment parties committed to arrange and underwrite senior secured credit facilities in an
aggregate amount of up to $5.145 billion (which we refer to as the “debt financing”). In order to facilitate the debt financing, a
portion of the debt financing was funded into escrow pursuant to a term loan credit agreement, dated as of December 16, 2016
(which we refer to as the “term loan credit agreement”), among certain affiliates of Parent, as borrowers, Bank of America, as
administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto and upon satisfaction of the conditions described in the term
loan credit agreement, the escrowed proceeds will be released to fund a portion of the merger consideration. Although the debt
financing is not subject to a due diligence or “market out,” the obligations of the escrow agent to release the funds from escrow and
the obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment letter are subject to certain
customary conditions and such financing should not be considered assured. For more information on the financing of the merger,
see the section entitled “The Merger—Financing of the Merger,” beginning on page 97.

Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals (see page 115)

Until the earlier of the effective time or termination of the merger agreement (if any), the Company has agreed that it
will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other representatives (which, collectively, we refer
to as the “Company representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly through another person:
 

 

•  initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry or the making or submission of any proposal or
offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a competing proposal (as described in the section
entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals,” beginning on
page 115);

 

 

•  furnish any non-public information regarding the Company or any of its subsidiaries to any third person in
connection with or in response to, or afford access to the Company representatives or the books, records or
properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect to, any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes
or would reasonably be expected to lead to a competing proposal; or

 

 
•  engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third person

with respect to any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to any
competing proposal made by such third person or any of its representatives.

Notwithstanding the non-solicitation provisions described above, under certain limited circumstances and prior to the
receipt of the Company stockholder approval, the Company may furnish information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries
with respect to certain written competing proposals that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions described
above and engage with discussions and negotiations with a person with respect to such competing proposals (as described in the
section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals,” beginning on
page 115).

In addition, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company stockholder approval, the Board or any committee thereof
may change its recommendation in favor of the merger (and, if desired by the Board or the committee, terminate the merger
agreement in order to cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a competing proposal) if and only if
(i) a written competing proposal that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions described above is made to the
Company by a third person and the Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such competing proposal constitutes a superior proposal (as described in the section entitled
“The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals,” beginning on page 115) and that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board to the Company’s
stockholders under applicable law and (ii) so long as the Company has complied in all respects with certain terms of the merger
agreement, including (A) providing Parent at least five days prior written notice of its intent to change its recommendation or
terminate the merger agreement and (B) negotiating with Parent in good faith regarding revisions proposed by Parent to the terms
of the merger agreement (if requested by Parent) for a period of five days, subject to additional three day negotiation periods if the
terms of the competing proposal materially change during such negotiation period. In the event of such a termination by the
Company, the Company would be required to pay the Company termination fee to Parent, as described below. The Board may also
change its recommendation in response to certain other limited intervening events, as described in the section entitled “The
Agreement and Plan of Merger—Obligations of the Board with Respect to its Recommendation,” beginning on page 116).

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 125)

The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time, whether before or after receipt of the
Company stockholder approval and whether before or after adoption of the merger agreement by Parent as sole stockholder of Sub,
by either the Company or Parent:
 

 •  by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;
 

 

•  if the effective time does not occur on or before October 3, 2017 (which we refer to as the “outside date”),
provided, however, that this right to terminate the merger agreement shall not be available to any party that has
failed to use its reasonable best efforts to satisfy certain of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement or
failed in any material respect to comply with those provisions of the merger agreement described under “—Efforts
to Complete the Merger”;

 

 

•  if the special meeting of the Company’s stockholders, held for the purpose of voting on, among other things, the
approval and adoption of the merger agreement (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) (which
we refer to as the “stockholder meeting”) was held and concluded without obtaining the Company stockholder
approval; and

 

 

•  if any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction issues or enters any order permanently enjoining, restraining
or prohibiting the merger, and such order becomes final and non-appealable, provided that this right to terminate
the merger agreement will not be available to any party that has failed to use its reasonable best efforts to contest,
resolve or lift, as applicable, such order, or failed in any material respect to comply with those provisions of the
merger agreement described under “—Efforts to Complete the Merger.”

The Company may also terminate the merger agreement:
 

 

•  if, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company stockholder approval, the Board or any committee thereof
effects a Board recommendation change in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement in order to accept a
superior proposal and enter into a definitive agreement with respect thereto; but only if the Company has
complied in all respects with its obligations under the merger agreement and pays Parent the Company
termination fee prior to or simultaneously therewith;

 

 

•  if (i) Parent or Sub breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in the merger agreement, in any case such that an applicable condition to the merger described above
would not be satisfied, (ii) the Company delivers to Parent written notice of such breach or failure to perform and
(iii) either such breach or failure to perform is not capable of cure or at least 30 days elapse after the date of
delivery of such written notice to Parent without such breach or failure to perform having been cured; provided,
however, that such right to terminate the merger agreement is not available if the Company breaches or fails to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement, in any
case such that an applicable condition to the merger described above would not be satisfied; and

 

 

•  if (i) all of the applicable conditions to the merger described above (other than (A) those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger and (B) the condition to the merger relating to the bank sale
agreements and the termination of WFB’s bank charter described above, so long as in the case of this clause
(B) such condition would reasonably be expected to be satisfied prior to closing of the merger if the closing of the
merger were to be effected as required by the merger agreement) have been satisfied or waived, (ii) the Company
has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the
closing of the merger and (iii) Parent and Sub have failed to consummate the

closing within two business days following the date by which the closing of the merger is required to have
occurred pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement (assuming the condition referred to in clause (B) has been
satisfied).

Parent may also terminate the merger agreement:
 

 

•  if, at any time prior to the Company stockholder approval, (i) the Board fails to include the Board
recommendation in the proxy statement or effects a Board recommendation change (as more fully described in the
section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Obligations of the Board with Respect to Its
Recommendation,” beginning on page 116), (ii) any of the Company’s officers or directors or certain of its
representatives breach, or cause or direct the Company or any of the other Company representatives to breach, in
any material respect any of its non-solicitation or Board recommendation obligations described above, which such
breach has not been cured within five business days of written notice thereof from Parent, or (iii) the Company or
the Board or any committee thereof authorizes or publicly proposes the taking of any of the foregoing actions;
provided, however, that if the applicable Board recommendation change is made with respect to an intervening
event as described in the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Termination of the Merger
Agreement—Termination Rights Exercisable by Parent,” beginning on page 126, Parent is required to exercise
such termination right no later than the earlier of (A) two business days prior to the stockholder meeting and
(B) ten business days after such Board recommendation change; and

 

 

•  if (i) the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in the merger agreement, in any case such that an applicable condition to the merger described above
would not be satisfied, (ii) Parent delivers to the Company written notice of such breach or failure to perform and
(iii) either such breach or failure to perform is not capable of cure or at least 30 days elapse after the date of
delivery of such written notice to the Company without such breach or failure to perform having been cured;
provided, however, that such right to terminate the merger agreement is not available if Parent or Sub breach or
fail to perform any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the merger
agreement, in any case such that an applicable condition to the merger described above would not be satisfied.

Termination Fees (see page 127)

Upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, the Company will be required to pay Parent a
termination fee of $126,000,000. Upon termination of the merger agreement under certain specified circumstances, Parent will be
obligated to pay the Company a termination fee of $230,000,000. In the event that the bank sale agreements are terminated under
certain specified circumstances in which the Company termination fee is payable by the Company to Parent under the merger
agreement, Capital One will be entitled to receive from the Company a termination fee of $14,000,000. In the event that the bank
sale agreements are terminated after the Company and Parent mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement and, in connection
with the termination, Parent receives any payment or fee from the Company, Capital One will be entitled to receive from the
Company a termination fee of 10% of the aggregate payment or fee received by Parent from the Company. In the event that the
bank sale agreements are terminated under certain specified circumstances (including certain specified circumstances after the
merger agreement is terminated), Synovus will be entitled to receive from Capital One a termination fee of $10,000,000, plus the
amount of certain costs and expenses. In certain circumstances, WFB is obligated to reimburse Capital One for up to $10,000,000
of such termination fee and such costs and expenses paid to Synovus.

Appraisal Rights (see page 141)

Under Delaware law, holders of shares of Company common stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the
merger, provided that such holders meet all of the conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder of Company common
stock who properly seeks appraisal and complies with the applicable requirements under Delaware law, and does not thereafter lose
his, her or its right to, or properly withdraw their demand for, appraisal rights (which we refer to as “dissenting stockholders”) will
forego the merger consideration and instead receive a cash payment equal to the fair value of his, her or its shares of Company
common stock in connection with the merger. Fair value will be determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(which we refer to as the “Court of Chancery”) following an appraisal proceeding. Dissenting stockholders will not know the
appraised fair value at the time such holders must elect whether to seek appraisal. The ultimate amount dissenting stockholders
receive in an appraisal proceeding may be more or less than, or the same as, the amount such holders would have received under
the merger agreement. A detailed description of the appraisal rights available to holders of Company common stock and
procedures required to exercise statutory appraisal rights is included in the section entitled “Appraisal Rights,” beginning on
page 141.

To seek appraisal, a Company stockholder of record must deliver a written demand for appraisal to the Company before
the vote on the merger agreement at the special meeting, not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement,
continuously hold the shares of Company common stock through the effective time and otherwise comply with the procedures set
forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Delaware law may result in the loss of
appraisal rights. Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, assuming that immediately prior to the merger shares of Company common
stock continue to be listed on the NYSE, the Court of Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all holders of shares
who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of Company common stock eligible for appraisal, or (ii) the value of the merger consideration provided in the
merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1,000,000.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 98)

The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder (as described in the section entitled “The Merger—Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,” beginning on page 98) who receives cash in exchange for shares of
Company common stock in the merger will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the cash received and the
U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares converted into the right to receive cash in the merger. Gain or loss will be determined
separately for each block of shares of Company common stock (that is, shares acquired for the same cost in a single transaction).
You should refer to the discussion in the section entitled “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger,” beginning on page 98, and consult your tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax
consequences of the merger.

Where You Can Find More Information (see page 153)

You can find more information about the Company in the periodic reports and other information we file with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the “SEC”). The information is available at the SEC’s public
reference facilities and at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER

The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions regarding the special
meeting of stockholders and the merger. These questions and answers do not address all questions that may be important to you as a
Company stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the Annexes to this
proxy statement and the documents referred to in this proxy statement.

 
Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
 

A: On October 3, 2016, the Company, Parent and Sub entered into the original merger agreement and on April 17, 2017, the
Company, Parent and Sub amended the original merger agreement by entering into the merger agreement amendment. You
are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Company in favor of the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals described in this proxy statement.

 
Q: As a stockholder, what will I receive in the merger?
 

A: At the effective time, except as described below, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time (other than (i) shares of Company common stock that are held in the treasury of the Company or
owned of record by any subsidiary of the Company and all shares owned of record by Parent, Sub or any of their respective
subsidiaries, in each case immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) shares of Company common stock held by
stockholders who have not voted in favor of, or consented to the adoption of, the merger agreement and who have properly
demanded appraisal of such shares and complied in all respects with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of
holders of shares to request appraisal of their shares) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive
$61.50 in cash, without interest thereon, subject to any applicable withholding taxes and the following paragraph.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger consideration will be adjusted as follows in the event that the bank
framework agreement is validly terminated, although the merger agreement provides that the merger cannot close until the
financial services business has been sold and the bank framework agreement can only be terminated in certain
circumstances, as described in the section entitled “The Bank Sale Agreements—Termination Rights; Effect of
Termination,” beginning on page 134:

 

 

•  in the event that the bank framework agreement is validly terminated by Synovus in accordance with its terms and the
original bank purchase agreement is automatically deemed to be re-executed in its original form pursuant to the terms
thereof, as further described below, then the merger consideration to be paid by Parent if the closing of the sale of the
financial services business and the closing of the merger occurs will be $62.50 per share in cash, without interest
thereon; and

 

 
•  in the event that the bank framework agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms such that none of

the original bank purchase agreement, the bank framework agreement and the credit card program agreement remains
in effect pursuant to the terms thereof, then either, at the Company’s election,

 

 

•  such merger consideration to be paid by Parent if the closing of the sale of the financial services business
and the closing of the merger occurs will be $65.50 per share in cash, without interest thereon, and the
Company will generally be restricted from entering into an alternative transaction with respect to the
financial services business on terms that are materially less favorable than those of the original bank
purchase agreement and the credit card program agreement, in its original form without giving effect to
any amendments thereto, without Parent’s prior written consent, or

•  such merger consideration to be paid by Parent if the closing of the sale of the financial services business
and the closing of the merger occurs will be $62.50 per share in cash, without interest thereon, and the
Company will generally be restricted from entering into an alternative transaction with respect to the
financial services business on terms that are materially less favorable than those of the original bank
purchase agreement and the credit card program agreement, as amended, without Parent’s prior written
consent.

The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Please see the discussion in the section entitled “The Merger—Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,” beginning on page 98, for a more detailed description of the
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. You should consult your own tax advisor for a full understanding of
how the merger will affect your U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes.

 
Q: What will happen to outstanding Company equity awards and the Company’s equity plans in the merger?
 

A: For information regarding the treatment of outstanding Company equity awards and the Company’s equity plans, see the
section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards and Equity Plans,”
beginning on page 107.

 
Q: Why was the original merger agreement amended?
 

A: In connection with the entry into the bank sale agreements, the Company, Parent and Sub amended the original merger
agreement by entering into the merger agreement amendment setting forth, among other things, the merger consideration as
described herein, which reflects a reduction from that set forth in the original merger agreement, except in certain
circumstances. For more information about the background of and reasons for the merger agreement amendment, see the
sections entitled “The Merger—Background of the Merger,” beginning on page 34, and “The Merger—Reasons for
Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement,” beginning on page 64.

 
Q: Where and when will the special meeting of stockholders be held?
 

A: The special meeting of Company stockholders will be held at the Company’s corporate headquarters, One Cabela Drive,
Sidney, Nebraska 69160, on July 11, 2017, at 8:00 a.m. local time.

 
Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
 

A: Only holders of record of Company common stock as of the close of business on June 2, 2017, the record date for the special
meeting, are entitled to vote at the special meeting. You will be entitled to one vote on each of the proposals presented in this
proxy statement for each share of Company common stock that you held on the record date.

 
Q: What proposals will be considered at the special meeting?

At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on:
 

 •  a proposal to adopt the merger agreement;
 

 
•  a proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the

Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, as discussed in the section
entitled “The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 87; and

•  a proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time to a later date or time if necessary or appropriate,

including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement if there are insufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

 

Q: What vote is required to approve each of the proposals?
 

A: The proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter. Abstentions and failures to vote will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

The approval of the non-binding compensation advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. Although the Board intends to
consider the vote resulting from this proposal, the vote is advisory only and, therefore, is not binding on the Company or
Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the merger agreement is adopted by Company stockholders and the
merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger will be payable to our named
executive officers even if this proposal is not approved. The abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal.

The approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special
meeting. In addition, even if a quorum is not present at the special meeting, either the chairman of the Board or the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special
meeting may adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time. In each case, the abstention from voting will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.

 
Q: How does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?
 

A: Upon careful consideration, the Board has unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the merger, are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and unanimously
recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, “FOR” the non-binding advisory merger-
related compensation proposal and “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time if necessary or
appropriate.

For a discussion of the factors the Board considered in determining to recommend the adoption of the merger agreement,
please see the section entitled “The Merger—Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement,”
beginning on page 64. In addition, in considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger agreement,
you should be aware that members of the Board and our executive officers have various interests in the merger that may be
in addition to, or different from, the interests of Company stockholders generally. See the section entitled “The Merger—
Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 87.

 
Q: Have the members of the Board committed to vote a certain way?
 

A: In connection with the merger agreement, each of the directors of the Company, who collectively beneficially owned an
aggregate of 13,261,189 shares of Company common stock as of October 3, 2016, representing approximately 18.52% of
the shares of Company common stock outstanding as of that date, entered into the voting agreements, pursuant to which
each of the directors agreed, among other things, (i) to vote in favor of the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, (ii) to vote against certain other matters and (iii) on certain restrictions in the transfer of their
shares of Company common stock. The voting agreements are executed by each of these directors

in an individual capacity as a stockholder and do not limit or restrict such signatory thereto from acting in his or her capacity
as a director in such person’s discretion on any matter. A copy of the form of voting agreement executed by all directors
other than James W. Cabela and Dennis Highby is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Forms of the voting
agreements executed by James W. Cabela and Dennis Highby are attached as Annex C and Annex D, respectively. The
foregoing summary of the voting agreements is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the
forms of the voting agreements attached as Annex B, Annex C and Annex D to this proxy statement and incorporated herein
by reference. For additional information, see the section entitled “The Voting Agreements,” beginning on page 140.

 
Q: Do I need to attend the special meeting in person?
 

A: No. It is not necessary for you to attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares. You may vote by mail, by telephone
or through the Internet, as described in more detail in the section entitled “The Special Meeting—How to Vote,” beginning
on page 28.

 
Q: Are there any requirements if I plan on attending the special meeting?
 

A: If you wish to attend the special meeting, you may be asked to present valid photo identification. Please note that if your
shares of Company common stock are held in the name of a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, you are considered the
“beneficial holder” of such shares held for you in what we refer to as “street name.” If you hold your shares in “street
name,” you will need to bring a copy of your voting instruction card or brokerage statement reflecting your Company
common stock ownership as of the record date and check in at the registration desk at the special meeting. Cameras, sound
or video recording devices or any similar equipment, or the distribution of any printed materials, will not be permitted at the
special meeting without the approval of the Company.

 
Q: How many shares need to be represented at the special meeting?
 

A: The presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Company common
stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting constitutes a quorum for the purpose of considering
the proposals. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 68,911,660 shares of Company common stock
outstanding. If you are a Company stockholder of record (i.e., your shares of Company common stock are registered in your
name with the Company’s transfer agent) as of the close of business on the record date and you vote by mail, by telephone,
through the Internet or in person at the special meeting, you will be considered part of the quorum. If you are a “street name”
holder of shares of Company common stock (i.e., you hold your shares in the name of a bank, broker, trust or other nominee
and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by that entity) and you provide your bank, broker, trust or other
nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. If you are a
“street name” holder of shares and you do not provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions,
then your shares will not be counted as present in determining the presence of a quorum.

All shares of Company common stock held by stockholders that are present in person, or represented by proxy, and entitled
to vote at the special meeting, regardless of how such shares are voted or whether such stockholders have indicated on their
proxy that they are abstaining from voting, will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. In the absence of a
quorum, the special meeting may be adjourned.

Table of Contents

Q: Why am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that may be
paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers and that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the
merger?

 

A: In 2010, the SEC adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding advisory vote to approve certain compensation
that may be paid or become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to corporate
transactions, such as the merger. In accordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the
Company is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on compensation that may
be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger. For additional
information, see the section entitled “Proposal 2: Non-Binding Advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal,” on page
32.

 

Q: What will happen if Company stockholders do not approve the non-binding advisory merger-related compensation
proposal?

 

A: The vote to approve the non-binding advisory merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the
vote to adopt the merger agreement. Approval of the non-binding advisory merger-related compensation proposal is not a
condition to completion of the merger, and it is advisory in nature only, meaning that it will not be binding on the Company
or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by the Company’s
stockholders and the merger is completed, the compensation subject to the non-binding merger-related compensation
proposal will be paid to our named executive officers even if the proposal is not approved.

 
Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement and the Annexes attached to this
proxy statement, please vote your shares of Company common stock in one of the ways described below as soon as possible.
You will be entitled to one vote for each share of Company common stock that you owned on the record date.

 
Q: How do I vote if I am a stockholder of record?
 

A: You may vote by:
 

 
•  submitting your proxy by completing, signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it by mail in the

enclosed prepaid envelope;
 

 •  submitting your proxy by using the telephone number printed on each proxy card you receive;
 

 •  submitting your proxy through the Internet voting instructions printed on each proxy card you receive; or
 

 •  by appearing in person at the special meeting and voting by ballot.

If you are submitting your proxy by telephone or through the Internet, your voting instructions must be received by
11:59 p.m. Central Time on the day before the special meeting.

Submitting your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet will not prevent you from voting in person at the
special meeting. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet even if you plan to
attend the special meeting in person to ensure that your shares of Company common stock are represented at the special
meeting. If you vote in person at the special meeting, such vote will automatically revoke any proxy you previously
submitted.

If you return your signed and dated proxy card, but do not mark the boxes showing how you wish to vote, your shares of
Company common stock will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, “FOR” the approval of the
non-binding compensation advisory proposal and “FOR” the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting from
time to time if necessary or appropriate.

Q: What if my shares of Company common stock are held for me in “street name” by a bank, broker, trust or other
nominee; will my bank, broker, trust or other nominee vote those shares for me with respect to the proposals?

 

A: No. If your shares of Company common stock are held in “street name,” you are not the “stockholder of record” of such
shares. If this is the case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. As
the beneficial holder, you generally have the right to direct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee as to how to vote your
shares of Company common stock. Your bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT have the power to vote your shares
of Company common stock at the special meeting unless you provide instructions to your bank, broker, trust or other
nominee on how to vote. You should instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote your shares with
respect to the proposals, using the instructions provided by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. You may be able to
vote by telephone or through the Internet if your bank, broker, trust or other nominee offers these options.

 
Q: What if I fail to instruct my bank, broker, trust or other nominee how to vote?
 

A: Your bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT be able to vote your shares of Company common stock unless you have
properly instructed your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote. Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks,
brokers, trusts and other nominees have the discretion to vote your shares of Company common stock on routine matters if
you fail to instruct your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Company common stock with
respect to such matters. The proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, and banks, brokers, trusts and other
nominees therefore cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. It is important that you instruct your bank,
broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote your shares with respect to the proposals, using the instructions provided by
your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. You may be able to vote by telephone or through the Internet if your bank, broker,
trust or other nominee offers these options. You are invited to attend the special meeting even if you are not a stockholder of
record; however, if you are not a stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the special meeting unless
you obtain a legal proxy, executed in your favor, from such bank, broker or other holder of record authorizing you to vote at
the special meeting.

 
Q: How can I vote my shares of Company common stock that are held in the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan (the

“401(k) Plan”)?
 

A: Shares of Company common stock held in the 401(k) Plan are held of record and are voted by the trustee of the 401(k) Plan
at the direction of the 401(k) Plan participants. If you participate in the 401(k) Plan and have contributions invested in the
Company’s common stock fund as of the record date, you will receive a full paper set of the proxy materials. You may direct
the trustee of the plan as to how to vote the shares of Company common stock allocated to your 401(k) Plan account by
submitting your proxy materials. The cutoff time for voting for participants in the 401(k) Plan is 11:59 p.m. Central Time on
July 6, 2017. The 401(k) Plan trustee will not vote shares as to which it has not received direction.

 
Q: How can I vote my shares of Company common stock that are held in the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan

(the “ESPP”)?
 

A: Shares of Company common stock held through the ESPP are held in your name by the ESPP’s administrator, Merrill
Lynch. For those shares, you will receive voting materials from Merrill Lynch. You should contact Merrill Lynch for more
information about how to ensure your shares are voted at the special meeting. The cutoff time for voting shares of Company
common stock held through the ESPP is 11:59 p.m. Central Time on July 6, 2017. For more information regarding your

Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card or after I have submitted my proxy by telephone or
through the Internet?

 

A: Yes. You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is voted at the special meeting. If you are a
stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by delivering a signed written notice of revocation stating that the proxy
is revoked and bearing a date later than the date of the proxy to our Corporate Secretary at Cabela’s Incorporated, One
Cabela Drive, Sidney, Nebraska 69160. You may also revoke your proxy or change your vote by submitting another proxy
by telephone or through the Internet in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. You may also submit a
later-dated proxy card relating to the same shares of Company common stock. If you voted by completing, signing, dating
and returning the enclosed proxy card, you should retain a copy of the voter control number found on the proxy card in the
event that you later decide to revoke your proxy or change your vote by telephone or through the Internet. Alternatively,
your proxy may be revoked or changed by attending the special meeting and voting in person. However, simply attending
the special meeting without voting will not revoke or change your proxy.

“Street name” holders of shares of Company common stock should contact their bank, broker, trust or other nominee to
obtain instructions as to how to revoke or change their proxies. If you have instructed a bank, broker, trust or other nominee
to vote your shares, you must follow the instructions received from your bank, broker, trust or other nominee to change your
vote.

All properly submitted proxies received by us before the special meeting that are not revoked or changed prior to being
exercised at the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on the
proxies or, if no instructions were provided, “FOR” each of the proposals.

 
Q: What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?
 

A: If you receive more than one proxy card, it means that you hold shares of Company common stock that are registered in
more than one account. For example, if you own your shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as
trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and you will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for
those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Therefore, to ensure that all of your shares of
Company common stock are voted, you will need to submit your proxies by properly completing and mailing each proxy
card you receive or by telephone or through the Internet by using the different voter control numbers on each proxy card.

 
Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Company common stock after the record date but before

the special meeting? What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of Company common stock after the
special meeting but before the effective time?

 

A: The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and earlier than the expected date of the
merger. If you own shares of Company common stock as of the close of business on the record date, but transfer your shares
prior to the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the
person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting, but the right to
receive the merger consideration will pass to the person who holds your shares as of immediately prior to the effective time.
If you sell or transfer your shares of Company common stock after the special meeting but before the effective time, the
right to receive the merger consideration will pass to the person who holds your shares as of immediately prior to the
effective time. In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of Company common stock through
the completion of the merger.

Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of Company common stock after the record date, we encourage you to
sign, date and return the enclosed proxy or submit your proxy to vote via the Internet

or by telephone, or, if your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, instruct your
bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by your bank, broker, trust
or other nominee.

 
Q: May I exercise dissenters’ rights or rights of appraisal in connection with the merger?
 

A: Yes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.
Under Delaware law, holders of record of Company common stock who do not vote in favor of adopting the merger
agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares as determined by the Court of Chancery if the
merger is completed. Appraisal rights will only be available to holders of shares of Company common stock who properly
deliver, and do not properly withdraw, a written demand for an appraisal to the Company prior to the vote on the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting and who comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The appraisal amount could be more than, the
same as or less than the amount a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement. A copy
of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex F to this proxy statement. For additional information, see the section
entitled “Appraisal Rights,” beginning on page 141.

 
Q: If I hold my shares in certificated form, should I send in my stock certificates now?
 

A: No. Shortly after the merger is completed, stockholders holding certificated shares of Company common stock will be sent a
letter of transmittal that includes detailed written instructions on how to return such stock certificates. You must return your
stock certificates in accordance with such instructions in order to receive the merger consideration. PLEASE DO NOT
SEND IN YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) NOW.

 
Q: Should I do anything with respect to my Company Options or RSU Awards now?
 

A: No. There is no need for you to do anything with respect to your Company Options or RSU Awards at this time. Shortly
after the merger is completed, your Company options and RSU awards will either be automatically exchanged for the
applicable consideration, or you will receive further instructions regarding such exchange.

 
Q: When is the merger expected to be completed?
 

A: We and Parent are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We currently anticipate that the merger will
be completed during the third quarter of 2017, subject to the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of
other closing conditions, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or, to the extent
permitted, waived. The merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted,
waived), including the adoption of the merger agreement by Company stockholders, the purchase and sale or other
disposition of the financial services business pursuant to the bank sale agreements and merger of WFB into the Company or
one of its subsidiaries and termination of WFB’s bank charter, and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. For additional
information, see the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Conditions to the Merger,” beginning on page
124.

 
Q: What happens if the merger is not completed?
 

A: If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is not approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company common stock entitled to vote on the matter or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not
receive any consideration from Parent or Sub for your

shares of Company common stock. Instead, the Company will remain a public company, and Company common stock will
continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and listed and traded on the NYSE. We expect that holders of shares of
Company common stock would continue to be subject to the same risks to which they are currently subject with respect to
their ownership of Company common stock. Under certain circumstances, if the merger is not completed, we may be
obligated to pay Parent the Company termination fee. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale
agreements is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions set forth in the merger agreement, and the
Company may be required to pay a further termination fee to Capital One and/or reimburse Capital One for a termination fee
paid to Synovus if those transactions are not completed. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement does not receive the
required approval from Company stockholders or the merger agreement is otherwise terminated, the transaction
contemplated by the bank sale agreements may not be consummated. For additional information, see the section entitled
“The Merger—Consequences if the Merger is Not Completed,” on page 96.

 
Q: Who will count the votes?
 

A: The votes will be counted by the independent inspector of elections appointed for the special meeting.

 
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
 

A: The Company intends to announce preliminary results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on
Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that the Company files with the SEC are
publically available when filed. See “Where You Can Find More Information,” on page 153.

 
Q: Where can I find more information about the Company?
 

A: The Company files periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy any
document we file at the SEC’s public reference room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the

THE SPECIAL MEETING

We are furnishing this proxy statement as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Company for use at the special meeting,
any postponement thereof, and at any properly reconvened meeting following an adjournment of the special meeting.

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting

The special meeting will be held on July 11, 2017, at 8:00 a.m. local time, at the Company’s corporate headquarters, One
Cabela Drive, Sidney, Nebraska 69160.

Company stockholders who wish to attend the special meeting may be asked to present valid photo identification. Please
note that, if you hold your shares of Company common stock in “street name,” you will need to bring a copy of your voting instruction
card or brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date and check in at the registration desk at the meeting.
Cameras, sound or video recording devices or any similar equipment, or the distribution of any printed materials, will not be permitted
at the meeting without the approval of the Company.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, Company stockholders of record will be asked to consider and vote on:
 

 
•  a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain specified

conditions, Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation;
 

 
•  a proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the

Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, as discussed in the section
entitled “The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 87; and

 

 
•  a proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time to a later date or time if necessary or appropriate,

including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement if there are insufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

Recommendation of the Board

The Board carefully reviewed and considered the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. By a unanimous vote, the Board (i) adopted and declared advisable the merger
agreement and the merger and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including
the merger, (ii) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, (iii) determined that the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
(iv) directed that a proposal to adopt the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of Company stockholders and
(v) recommended that Company stockholders vote for the adoption of the merger agreement. Accordingly, the Board unanimously
recommends a vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

The Board also unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the non-binding advisory merger-related compensation proposal
and “FOR” the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special

Record Date and Quorum

Each holder of record of shares of Company common stock as of the close of business on June 2, 2017, which is the record
date for the special meeting, is entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. You will be entitled to one vote for each
share of Company common stock that you owned on the record date. If you sell or transfer your shares of Company common stock
after the record date but before the special meeting, you will transfer the right to receive merger consideration, if the merger is
completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of Company common stock, but you will retain your right to vote
those shares at the special meeting. As of the record date, there were 68,911,660 shares of Company common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. The presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of
34,455,831 shares of Company common stock (a majority of the shares of Company common stock issued and outstanding and entitled
to vote at the special meeting) constitutes a quorum for the special meeting.

If you are a Company stockholder of record and you vote by mail, by telephone or through the Internet or in person at the
special meeting, then your shares of Company common stock will be counted as part of the quorum. If you are a “street name” holder
of shares of Company common stock and you provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your
shares will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares and you do not provide
your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will not be counted as present in determining the
presence of a quorum.

All shares of Company common stock held by stockholders of record that are present in person or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the special meeting, regardless of how such shares are voted or whether such stockholders abstain from voting, will
be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the special meeting may be adjourned.

Vote Required for Approval

The proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter.

The approval of the non-binding compensation advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. The vote is advisory only and, therefore, is not
binding on the Company or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the merger agreement is adopted by Company
stockholders and the merger is completed, the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger will be payable to our
named executive officers even if this proposal is not approved.

The approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. In
addition, even if a quorum is not present at the special meeting, either the chairman of the Board or the affirmative vote of a majority of
the shares having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting may adjourn the meeting to another
place, date or time.

Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

The proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter. Therefore, the failure to vote or the abstention from voting will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

The approval of the non-binding compensation advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. Consequently, the abstention from voting will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.

The proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. Consequently, the
abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal. In addition, even if a quorum is not present at the
special meeting, either the chairman of the Board or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares having voting power present in
person or represented by proxy at the special meeting may adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time. In each case, the
abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.

Under applicable stock exchange rules, all of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, so there can be
no broker non-votes at the special meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee are
represented at a meeting, but the bank, broker, trust or other nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner
and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares on a particular proposal, but has discretionary voting power on other
proposals at such meeting. Accordingly, if your shares are held in “street name,” your bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT be
able to vote your shares of Company common stock on any of the proposals, and your shares will not be counted as present in
determining the presence of a quorum, unless you have properly instructed your bank, broker, trust or other nominee on how to vote.
Because the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company
common stock, the failure to provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Because the approval of each of (i) the non-binding compensation
advisory proposal and (ii) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, and
because your bank, broker, trust or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either proposal, the failure to
provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions will have no effect on approval of each such proposal.

How to Vote

Stockholders of record have a choice of voting by proxy by completing a proxy card and mailing it in the prepaid envelope
provided, by calling a toll-free telephone number or through the Internet. Please refer to your proxy card to see which options are
available to you. The telephone and Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m. Central Time on the day
before the special meeting. If your shares are held in “street name,” please refer to the information forwarded by your bank, broker,
trust or other nominee to see which voting options are available to you.

If you submit your proxy by mail, by telephone or through the Internet voting procedures, but do not include “FOR,”
“AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on a proposal to be voted, your shares of Company common stock will be voted in favor of that
proposal. If you indicate “ABSTAIN” on a proposal to be voted, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” that proposal. If
you wish to vote by proxy and your shares are held by a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, you must follow the voting
instructions provided to you by your bank, broker, trust or other nominee. Unless you give your bank, broker, trust or other
nominee instructions on how to vote your shares of Company common stock, your bank, broker, trust or other nominee will NOT be
able to vote your shares on any of the proposals.

If you wish to vote in person at the special meeting and your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of
record, you must obtain a legal proxy, executed in your favor, from the bank, broker or other holder of record authorizing you to vote at
the special meeting.

If you do not submit a proxy or otherwise vote your shares of Company common stock in any of the ways described above,
it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but will have no effect on approval of
the non-binding compensation advisory proposal or the approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time if
necessary or appropriate.

If you have any questions about how to vote or direct a vote in respect of your shares of Company common stock, you may
contact our proxy solicitor, MacKenzie Partners, Inc., toll-free at (800) 322-2885 or (212) 929-5500 (call collect).

YOU SHOULD NOT SEND IN YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) WITH YOUR PROXY CARD. A letter of
transmittal with instructions for the surrender of certificates representing shares of Company common stock will be mailed to
stockholders if the merger is completed.

Revocation of Proxies

Any proxy given by a Company stockholder of record may be revoked at any time before it is voted at the special meeting
by doing any of the following:
 

 
•  by submitting another proxy by telephone or through the Internet, in accordance with the instructions on the proxy

card;
 

 
•  by delivering a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of the proxy to the Company’s

Corporate Secretary at Cabela’s Incorporated, One Cabela Drive, Sidney, Nebraska 69160, stating that the proxy is
revoked;

 

 •  by submitting a later-dated proxy card relating to the same shares of Company common stock; or
 

 
•  by attending the special meeting and voting in person (your attendance at the special meeting will not, by itself,

revoke your proxy; you must vote in person at the special meeting).

“Street name” holders of shares of Company common stock should contact their bank, broker, trust or other nominee to
obtain instructions as to how to revoke or change their proxies.

Adjournments and Postponements

Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time to a later day or
time if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Your
shares will be voted on any adjournment proposal submitted to stockholders in accordance with the instructions indicated in your proxy
or, if no instructions were provided, “FOR” the proposal.

If a quorum is present at the special meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned if there is an affirmative vote of shares
representing a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting entitled to
vote on such matter. In addition, even if a quorum is not present at the special meeting, either the chairman of the Board or the
affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
special meeting entitled to vote on such matter may adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time. In either case, the adjourned
meeting may take place without further notice other than by an announcement made at the special meeting, unless the adjournment is
for more than 30 days or if, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which case a notice of the
adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present at the
special meeting, or if a quorum is present at the special meeting but there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to
adopt the merger agreement, then the Company may seek to adjourn the special meeting from time to time. In addition, the Board may,
after consultation with Parent, postpone the special meeting upon public announcement made prior to the date previously scheduled for
the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies or as otherwise permitted under the merger agreement.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

As discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement, Company stockholders will consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the
merger agreement. You should carefully read this proxy statement in its entirety for more detailed information concerning the merger
agreement and the merger. In particular, you should read in its entirety the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this
proxy statement and which reflects the effect of the merger agreement amendment. In addition, see the sections entitled “The Merger,”
beginning on page 34, and “The Agreement and Plan of Merger,” beginning on page 104.

The Board unanimously recommends that Company stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

If you return a properly executed proxy card, but do not indicate instructions on your proxy card, your shares of Company
common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

The approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such proposal.

PROPOSAL 2: NON-BINDING ADVISORY MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION PROPOSAL

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010, we are required to provide stockholders the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis,
the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates
to the merger, as disclosed in the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden
Parachute Compensation,” beginning on page 92, including the table entitled “Golden Parachute Payment” and accompanying
footnotes. Accordingly, Company stockholders are being provided with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on such
payments.

As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon the Company or the Board, approval of this proposal is not a
condition to completion of the merger, and the merger-related named executive officer compensation subject to this non-binding
advisory vote will not be affected by the outcome of this non-binding advisory vote. However, the Company seeks your support and
believes that your support is appropriate because the Company has a comprehensive executive compensation program designed to link
the compensation of our executives with the Company’s performance and the interests of Company stockholders. Accordingly, we ask
that you vote on the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Cabela’s Incorporated approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation
that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Cabela’s Incorporated that is based on or otherwise relates to
the merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the heading “The Merger—Interests of Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation,” beginning on page 92 of its proxy statement (which disclosure
includes the Golden Parachute Compensation Table required pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K).”

The Board unanimously recommends that Company stockholders vote “FOR” the non-binding advisory merger-related
compensation proposal.

If you return a properly executed proxy card, but do not indicate instructions on your proxy card, your shares of Company
common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the non-binding advisory merger-related compensation proposal.

The approval of the non-binding advisory merger-related compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority
of the shares having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. The approval of the non-binding
advisory merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, and does not affect whether the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved. The vote is advisory only and,
therefore, is not binding on the Company or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, and, if the merger agreement is adopted by
Company stockholders and the merger is completed, the compensation subject to this non-binding advisory vote will be payable to our
named executive officers even if this proposal is not approved.

PROPOSAL 3: AUTHORITY TO ADJOURN THE SPECIAL MEETING

The Company may seek to adjourn the special meeting from time to time to a later date or time if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement if there are insufficient votes at the time of
the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

The Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time
to time to a later date or time if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

If you return a properly executed proxy card, but do not indicate instructions on your proxy card, your shares of Company
common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time to a
later date or time if necessary or appropriate.

The approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. In
addition, even if a quorum is not present at the special meeting, either the chairman of the Board or the affirmative vote of a majority of
the shares having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting may adjourn the meeting to another
place, date or time.

THE MERGER

Overview

The Company is seeking the adoption by Company stockholders of the original merger agreement the Company entered into
on October 3, 2016, as amended by the merger agreement amendment entered into on April 17, 2017. Under the terms of the merger
agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Sub will be merged with and into the Company. The Company
will continue as the surviving corporation and will succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub and the Company in
accordance with the DGCL, and will continue in existence as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Board has unanimously
approved the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that Company stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.

Upon the effective time, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time will be cancelled, extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive $61.50 in cash, without interest thereon,
subject to certain adjustments should the bank framework agreement be validly terminated in certain circumstances, subject to any
applicable withholding taxes, other than (i) shares of Company common stock that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of
record by any subsidiary of the Company, (ii) shares owned of record by Parent, Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, and
(iii) shares of Company common stock held by stockholders who have not voted in favor of, or consented to the adoption of, the
merger agreement and who have properly demanded appraisal of such shares and complied in all respects with all the provisions of the
DGCL concerning the right of holders of shares to require appraisal of their shares.

Following the completion of the merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company.

In connection with the merger agreement, the Company entered into the bank sale agreements. The bank sale agreements
provide for, in connection with and conditioned upon the closing of the merger, the sale of the financial services business. Pursuant to
the bank sale agreements, by way of three transactions, (i) Synovus has agreed to acquire assets and assume liabilities of WFB, which
collectively constitute substantially all of the business of WFB, (ii) Capital One has agreed to acquire certain other assets and assume
certain other liabilities of WFB and (iii) immediately following the transaction referred to in the foregoing clause (i), Synovus has
agreed to sell and assign to Capital One, and Capital One has agreed to acquire and assume, certain of such assets and liabilities
acquired and assumed by Synovus from WFB, such that Synovus retains all deposits of WFB and certain other assets and liabilities
relating to deposits of WFB and Capital One acquires the assets and liabilities relating to the Cabela’s CLUB co-branded credit card
accounts and equity interests in certain securitization funding vehicles. The bank sale agreements amended and restated the original
bank purchase agreement on April 17, 2017. You are not being asked to vote on or adopt any of the bank sale agreements.

Background of the Merger

The Board frequently reviews potential financial and strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. Over the years, the
Board has considered acquisitions, leveraged recapitalizations (including by way of a sale-leaseback transaction), the separation of the
Company’s retail business from its CLUB credit card account operations either by way of a spin-off of WFB, the owner of such
accounts and receivables, or a sale by the Company of WFB and/or such accounts and receivables to a financial institution, and
together with such spin-off or sale, the Company would enter into an arrangement with WFB or the financial institution buyer to run
the Company’s credit card account program following the transaction (any such spin-off, sale or subsequent arrangement being referred
to as a “CLUB transaction”), a separation of the Company’s retail operations from its real estate portfolio by way of the Company
creating a new publicly-traded real estate investment trust that would own all of the Company’s real estate and be managed by the
Company (which we refer to as an “OpCo/PropCo transaction”) and a sale of the whole Company to a third party. The Board also
frequently reviews cost-saving initiatives as well as other initiatives designed to enhance the financial performance and business of the
Company.

During the fall of 2014, at the request of the Company, Guggenheim Securities reviewed and reported to the Board with
respect to a number of potential strategic alternatives, including a sale-leaseback transaction, an acquisition of one or more other
industry participants and a CLUB transaction. As part of this review, the Company had several discussions with a financial institution
(which we refer to as “Financial Institution A”) regarding a possible CLUB transaction. Ultimately the Board determined that it
would not pursue a CLUB transaction or any other strategic alternatives at that time.

During the winter and spring of 2015, the Company conducted a thorough review of its cost structure and developed a
number of cost saving initiatives designed to enhance the financial performance of the Company (we refer to these initiatives as
“Project Apex”). In June of 2015, the Company began implementing a number of the recommended initiatives. Also during the spring
of 2015, the Company began development of a new five-year strategic growth plan (which we refer to as “Vision 2020”).

As part of the Company’s regular review process, the Company invited representatives of Guggenheim Securities to the
Company’s regularly scheduled June 4, 2015 Board meeting to review with the Board potential strategic alternatives the Company
could consider. Members of management and representatives of the Company’s outside counsel, Koley Jessen P.C., L.L.O. (which we
refer to as “Koley Jessen”), were also present for portions of the meeting. Guggenheim Securities discussed with the Board the current
state of the retail sector and recent history of the Company’s financial performance and stock price, as well as stockholder activism in
the retail sector and recent mergers and acquisitions activity. As part of the discussion, representatives of Guggenheim Securities
discussed with the Board a letter the Company received from Hirzel Capital Management, a stockholder of the Company,
recommending that the Company monetize its real estate and CLUB assets and reviewed with the Board a variety of potential strategic
alternatives that could be considered, including a recapitalization, a sale-leaseback transaction, an OpCo/PropCo transaction, an
acquisition, a CLUB transaction and a sale of the whole Company. During discussions among the members of the Board, together with
management and the Company’s advisors, it was noted that because the Company’s subsidiary WFB was a regulated bank which held
deposits, any sale of the Company would require bank regulatory approval, that the bank regulators may not approve such a transaction
and therefore if the Company wished to be acquired by a third party, it may have to first engage in a CLUB transaction with a regulated
bank partner pursuant to which the assets and deposits of WFB would be sold to such regulated bank partner and the charter of WFB
would be surrendered. We sometimes refer to this type of CLUB transaction as a “CLUB sale transaction” and the subsequent sale of
the remainder of the Company (consisting mostly of its retail operations) to a third party as a “retail sale transaction.” The Board,
together with management and Guggenheim Securities, discussed considerations relative to each of these alternatives, including
potential strategic benefits and challenges and preliminary financial considerations for each type of transaction based on projections of
management reviewed with the Board in February 2015. Following this discussion, the Board authorized management to further
analyze potential strategic alternatives and to formally engage Guggenheim Securities to act as the Company’s financial advisor in
connection with the Company’s evaluation of strategic and financial alternatives.

On July 8, 2015, the Company formally retained Guggenheim Securities to act as the Company’s financial advisor with
respect to the Company’s review of various potential strategic and financial alternatives.

During the months of July and August 2015, the Company worked with its advisors to review the merits of various potential
strategic alternatives discussed with the Board in June. As part of that process, at the direction of the Company, Guggenheim Securities
contacted five private equity firms to see if they would be interested in engaging in a potential transaction with the Company and five
financial institutions to see whether they would be interested in engaging in a potential transaction involving WFB and the Company’s
credit card program. During these months, Koley Jessen also negotiated confidentiality agreements with all of these potentially
interested parties. None of the private equity firms contacted by Guggenheim Securities signed the confidentiality agreement and only
one of the financial institutions signed the confidentiality agreement. The Company did not provide any confidential information to any
of these parties at that time.

On August 11, 2015, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting. Management and representatives of Koley Jessen and
Guggenheim Securities were present for portions of the meeting. The Board, together with management and representatives of
Guggenheim Securities, discussed the Company’s recent financial and stock price performance. Guggenheim Securities then discussed
with the Board various potential strategic alternatives, including a recapitalization, an OpCo/PropCo transaction, a CLUB sale
transaction and a retail sale transaction. The Board, together with management and the Company’s advisors, discussed financial,
strategic and regulatory considerations related to each of the alternatives, including considerations regarding the Company’s ability to
execute such alternatives and timing. During such discussions, the Board considered, among other things, (i) that a recapitalization,
while potentially creating stockholder value, may adversely impact financial flexibility going forward, (ii) that an OpCo/PropCo
transaction would be challenging due to the relatively small size of the portfolio involved and (iii) concerns regarding the possibility of
misalignment of interests between the Company and a CLUB partner regarding the strategic direction of the CLUB and the Company
if the Company were to engage in a CLUB transaction and remain as a stand-alone public company. Guggenheim Securities reviewed
the status of discussions with the potentially interested parties Guggenheim Securities had contacted regarding a CLUB sale transaction
or a retail sale transaction, other parties that may be interested in each type of transaction, and illustrative structures and terms for a
CLUB sale transaction. Guggenheim Securities also discussed with the Board preliminary financial considerations relating to each of
the potential strategic alternatives based on management’s projections. Management then discussed with the Board the Company’s
strategic growth plan, including its capital plan. Following discussion, the Board authorized the continued review of potential strategic
alternatives. The Board also discussed with management the status of Project Apex and Vision 2020.

On August 28, 2015, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting. Management and representatives of Koley Jessen were
present for portions of the meeting. Management discussed with the Board the Company’s Vision 2020. Management recommended to
the Board that based on the review of potential strategic alternatives, management believed that the Board should authorize a share
repurchase and continue to implement Project Apex and Vision 2020. Following discussion, the Board concluded that based on the
current environment and the Company’s existing cost savings and other similar initiatives, the Company would authorize a share
repurchase program but would cease the broader exploration of potential strategic alternatives. Consistent with this determination,
Guggenheim Securities was instructed to cease working on a review of potential strategic alternatives.

On October 26, 2015, a representative of affiliates of Elliott Management Corporation (which we refer to as “EMC”)
informed a representative of Guggenheim Securities that EMC had acquired approximately a 10% economic interest in the Company
and would be filing a Schedule 13D in which EMC would express its view that the Company’s stock was undervalued. Representatives
of Guggenheim Securities informed Company management of the communication from EMC. On October 27, 2015, representatives of
EMC had a call with members of the Company’s management and provided a similar message. On October 28, 2015, EMC filed a
Schedule 13D indicating that it and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 6% of the outstanding common stock of the
Company and had derivative arrangements in place which gave it economic exposure to another 5.1% of the outstanding common
stock of the Company. The Schedule 13D stated that EMC believed that the Company was undervalued by the public market and that
EMC was seeking an opportunity to engage in discussions with the Company regarding potential strategic alternatives, including a sale
of the Company, asset monetization, capital allocation and capital structure optimizations and operational and management initiatives.

Following the filing of the Schedule 13D and throughout the remainder of the period ending with the signing of the merger
agreement, there were many reports in both the local and national media regarding the future of the Company, including rumors that
other parties may be interested in engaging in a transaction with the Company. The Company also received communications from
certain other stockholders of the Company suggesting that the Company consider a sale of the Company.

On October 29, 2015, the Board held a special meeting to discuss the contact with EMC. Also present for portions of the
meeting were members of management, and representatives of Koley Jessen, Sidley Austin

LLP, legal counsel to the Company (which we refer to as “Sidley Austin”), and Guggenheim Securities. Members of management and
representatives of Guggenheim Securities described for the Board the communication received from EMC as well as the Schedule 13D
filing made by EMC. The Board discussed possible responses to EMC and next steps. The Board authorized the Company and its
advisors to continue to develop plans to respond to EMC.

In early November, several media outlets reported that their sources had informed them that Parent was developing a
proposal to acquire the Company.

On November 5, 2015, members of management, together with representatives of Koley Jessen, Sidley Austin and
Guggenheim Securities, met to discuss potential responses to EMC.

Also on November 5, Mr. Michael McCarthy, the lead independent director of the Company, received a telephone call from
Mr. John Morris, the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Parent, indicating that Parent was interested in exploring a potential
acquisition of the Company. On November 9, 2015, another industry participant, referred to as “Strategic Party A,” sent a letter to the
Company expressing its interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company.

On November 13, 2015, the Board held a special meeting to discuss potential responses to EMC. Members of management
and representatives of Koley Jessen, Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities were present for portions of the meeting.
Representatives of Sidley Austin discussed with the Board the fiduciary duties of the Board members under the circumstances.
Mr. McCarthy and management then updated the Board with respect to preparations being made by management and the Company’s
advisors in response to EMC. Mr. McCarthy and management also updated the Board on the in-bound call from Parent to
Mr. McCarthy and the letter received from Strategic Party A regarding their respective interest in a potential acquisition of the
Company. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities also indicated they had received inquiries from several private equity firms
regarding exploring an acquisition of the Company and several financial institutions regarding exploring a CLUB sale transaction.
Members of management, together with representatives of Guggenheim Securities, discussed with the Board upcoming events,
including the meeting proposed between management and representatives of EMC. Representatives of Sidley Austin and Guggenheim
Securities discussed with the Board and members of management various potential scenarios that may occur and potential next steps
the Company could consider taking, including maintaining the status quo, exploring potential strategic alternatives (either privately or
coupled with a public announcement) and attempting to enter into a settlement agreement with EMC. Management also discussed with
the Board key employee retention concerns created by the uncertainty with respect to the Company’s future and steps that were being
considered to mitigate the retention concerns. Following discussion, the Board determined to continue to consider the next steps
available to the Company and to evaluate further following management’s meeting with EMC.

In mid-November 2015, Mr. McCarthy and several members of management had a meeting with representatives of EMC in
which the representatives of EMC stated that they believed the Company should be sold through a public auction process and that, if
the Company did not engage in a sales process, EMC was prepared to take further steps with respect to the Company.

On November 20, 2015, the Board held a special meeting to discuss potential responses to EMC. Members of management
and representatives of Koley Jessen, Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities were present for portions of the meeting. Members of
management described for the Board management’s meeting with representatives of EMC. They noted that EMC representatives
indicated they believed the Company should be sold through a public auction process and that, if the Company did not engage in a
sales process, EMC was prepared to take further steps with respect to the Company. Following further discussion, the Board
determined that the Company and its advisors should continue to review its options. Also on November 20, 2015, the Compensation
Committee of the Board held a special meeting to discuss “double trigger” change of control severance agreements for key employees
of the Company (i.e., agreements pursuant to which severance

payments and benefits would be triggered by the occurrence of a change of control transaction coupled with a subsequent qualifying
termination of employment). Other members of the Board, members of management, as well as representatives of Koley Jessen and
Sidley Austin were present for portions of the meeting. The Committee and management discussed the uncertainty created by EMC’s
public statements and the recent media reports regarding a potential sale of the Company and the concern that this uncertainty would
adversely affect the Company’s ability to retain key employees. Management reviewed with the Committee the non-executive officer
key employee “double trigger” change of control severance arrangements management was recommending be entered into with such
key employees. Following discussion, the Committee approved the entry into “double trigger” change of control severance
arrangements for such key employees.

On November 24, 2015, the Board held a special meeting to further consider potential responses to EMC. Members of
management and representatives of Koley Jessen, Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities were present for portions of the meeting.
Mr. Millner updated the Board on developments since the last Board meeting, including the challenges to the business resulting from
the speculation regarding the Company’s future. In particular, Mr. Millner noted concerns around gift card sales as well as employee
focus. The Board then discussed with management the Company’s financial plans and projections, the Company’s financial
performance and the recent trends in the Company’s business. Following this discussion, Guggenheim Securities discussed with the
Board trends in the retail sector generally, noting that the sector was under pressure (and in particular that apparel dependent retailers
were underperforming the broader retail sector), various preliminary financial perspectives regarding the Company and certain industry
participants as well as strategic trends in the retail sector. The Board, together with representatives of Guggenheim Securities, then
discussed various potential strategic alternatives that the Board could consider, including a recapitalization, an OpCo/PropCo
transaction, a CLUB sale transaction and a retail sale transaction. The discussion included consideration of the work previously
performed by the Company and its advisors. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities noted that they and management had received
inquiries from various third parties expressing interest in exploring a potential transaction. Representatives of Sidley Austin then
discussed with the Board and management the potential paths that the Board could take in response to EMC and considerations with
respect to each of those paths. Following that discussion, Mr. Millner reviewed with the Board the challenges created for the business
by the Company’s current situation and stated that it was management’s recommendation that the Board authorize the Company to
explore potential strategic alternatives and that the Company publicly announce it was doing so. In an executive session of all of the
directors (including Mr. Millner), the Board further discussed next steps. Mr. McCarthy informed the Board that he had been informed
by Mr. James W. Cabela, co-founder of the Company and executive chairman of the Board, that if the Board determined to enter into a
transaction with Parent or certain other strategic potential purchasers of the Company, Mr. Cabela was not certain he would be willing
to, in his capacity as a stockholder of the Company, support a transaction with any of them. The representatives of Sidley Austin
discussed with the Board the fiduciary obligations of a board of directors in connection with a transaction that may constitute a change
of control under Delaware law. The Board discussed the effect that Mr. Cabela’s position could have on the Company’s ability to
engage in potential strategic alternatives, and in particular a sale of the Company. In an executive session of the independent members
(without the presence of Messrs. Cabela, Millner or Dennis Highby, who as the former Chief Executive Officer of the Company is not
considered independent under the NYSE rules), the Board further discussed the options available to the Company in response to EMC
as well as the impact that Mr. Cabela’s position could have on potential strategic alternatives and potential ways to mitigate any
adverse impact. The Board concluded it would continue to consider what alternatives to pursue in response to EMC’s approach and
reconvene to make a determination on December 1, 2015.

On December 1, 2015, the Board held a special meeting to further consider potential responses to EMC. Members of
management and representatives of Koley Jessen, Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities were present for portions of the meeting.
Mr. Millner provided the Board an update on the state of the business and confirmed that it remained management’s recommendation
that the Company initiate a strategic review process and publicly announce that it was doing so. The Board in executive session
discussed considerations relating to each of the approaches the Company could take, including management’s recommendation, and

concluded to authorize the Company to explore potential strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company, and to
publicly announce such exploration. The Board noted that it believed doing so would allow the Company to maintain control of the
process and reduce the level of uncertainty that was causing problems for the business. Representatives of Sidley Austin discussed with
the Board the fiduciary duties of the members of the Board in connection with reviewing potential strategic alternatives as well as
various processes to put in place in connection with the review. Representatives of Sidley Austin also reviewed terms of confidentiality
agreements that would be provided to potentially interested parties, noting that:
 

 •  the confidentiality agreement to be entered into with retail bidders:
 

 •  contained customary confidentiality and non-use provisions;
 

 

•  contained a customary “standstill” provision, and that such provision, in addition to allowing the retail
bidder to make proposals to the Company with respect to a negotiated retail transaction, contained a “fall
away” term that would permit the retail bidder to make private proposals to the Company at any time after
the Company entered into a definitive agreement to consummate a change of control transaction;

 

 

•  recognizing the need for an efficient and controlled process, prohibited the retail bidder from (i) entering
into arrangements with other parties with respect to a transaction involving the Company, including to
effect a CLUB sale transaction; (ii) engaging financing sources unless the Company granted permission;
and (iii) engaging in discussions with management regarding post-closing employment; and

 

 
•  the confidentiality agreement to be entered into with the CLUB bidders contained similar provisions other than the

standstill provision.

Members of management and representatives of the Company’s advisors returned to the meeting and discussed next steps,
including parties that may be interested in engaging in a CLUB sale transaction (which we refer to as potential “CLUB bidders” or
“CLUB sale transaction bidders”) or a retail transaction (which we refer to as potential “retail bidders” or “retail transaction
bidders”) and soliciting indications of interest from such potentially interested parties. The Board also instructed members of
management not to have discussions with CLUB bidders or retail bidders regarding post-closing employment and instructed
Guggenheim Securities not to have any discussions with any potentially interested parties regarding participation by Guggenheim
Securities in the financing of any potential transaction. Such instructions were not given by the Board in response to any request by
Company management or Guggenheim Securities for permission to have such discussions.

On December 2, 2015, the Company issued a press release stating that the Company was undertaking a review of various
potential strategic alternatives.

Over the next several months, at the direction of the Board, management of the Company, with the assistance of the
Company’s advisors, continued to review potential strategic alternatives, including preparing auctions for a potential CLUB sale
transaction and retail transaction and Guggenheim Securities began to contact parties potentially interested in a CLUB sale transaction
or a retail transaction. Eight strategic parties, including Parent and Strategic Party A, and twenty-one private equity firms, including
those previously contacted by Guggenheim Securities during the summer of 2015, were either contacted by Guggenheim Securities or
contacted Guggenheim Securities regarding exploring a potential retail transaction. Over the course of the next several months, Sidley
Austin negotiated confidentiality agreements with the potentially interested parties. Of the eight strategic parties, three (Parent,
Strategic Party A and another strategic party (which we refer to as “Strategic Party C”) that was proffered by one of the private equity
firms as a prospective partner for that firm’s bid (but which was not independently viewed as having the financial capacity for a
potential retail transaction) ultimately signed confidentiality agreements (which included the standstill provision referred to above)
with the Company and received confidential materials. Of the twenty-one private equity firms, thirteen ultimately signed
confidentiality agreements with the Company and received confidential materials. In addition, fifteen financial

institutions, including Financial Institution A, were either contacted by Guggenheim Securities or contacted Guggenheim Securities
regarding exploring a potential CLUB sale transaction. Twelve of the financial institutions (including Financial Institution A) signed
confidentiality agreements with the Company.

On December 14, 2015, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting. Members of management and representatives of
Koley Jessen, Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities were present for portions of the meeting. Representatives of Sidley Austin
reviewed with the Board the fiduciary obligations of the members of the Board in connection with the strategic review process. The
Board, together with management and the Company’s advisors, discussed financial, strategic and regulatory considerations related to
each of the alternatives. During such discussions, the Board considered, among other things, that (i) a recapitalization, while potentially
creating stockholder value, may adversely impact financial flexibility going forward, (ii) an OpCo/PropCo transaction may be
challenging due to the relatively small size of the portfolio involved and (iii) the change in control of the bank charter of WFB
involving a retail buyer may not be approved and instead the bank charter of WFB may need to be surrendered prior to any sale of the
Company and the deposits of WFB transferred to a regulated banking institution and, therefore, if the Board ultimately chose to
approve the sale of the Company, the sale would likely be contingent on first completing a CLUB sale transaction. The Board also
considered concerns regarding the possibility of misalignment of interests between the Company and a CLUB partner regarding the
strategic direction of the CLUB and the Company if the Company were to engage in a CLUB transaction but not a retail transaction
and remain as a stand-alone public company. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities also discussed with the Board the contacts to
date with potentially interested parties in the CLUB sale transaction and a retail transaction and noted that any purchaser of the retail
business would be interested in the terms of the CLUB sale transaction, and therefore to maximize potential value in a retail transaction
process, at some point the retail bidders might be offered the opportunity to negotiate directly the terms of the CLUB sale transaction
with one or more partners. Following discussion, Mr. Millner noted for the Board the challenges facing the Company’s business and
that management was finalizing the Company’s five year projections and would discuss that with the Board at a later meeting.
Mr. Millner also updated the Board on the status of Project Apex and Vision 2020. In executive session of all directors, the Board
discussed concerns regarding employee retention during the pendency of the strategic review process and the steps that had been taken
to date to mitigate those concerns, including the “double trigger” change of control severance agreements that were being entered into
with a number of key employees as authorized by the Compensation Committee on November 20, 2015. The Board authorized the
Company and its advisors to continue the potential strategic alternatives review work.

During January 2016, the Company provided ten of the twelve potential CLUB sale transaction bidders that had entered into
confidentiality agreements with the Company management presentations regarding the CLUB and the CLUB sale transaction. One of
the twelve financial institutions that entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company did not meet with management but
continued on in the process. Another financial institution that signed a confidentiality agreement indicated it was no longer interested
in pursuing a potential CLUB sale transaction. Following the meetings, one of the potential CLUB sale transaction bidders that
attended a management presentation indicated it was no longer interested in pursuing a potential CLUB sale transaction, leaving ten
remaining potential CLUB sale transaction bidders. The Company opened a virtual data room for the remaining ten potential CLUB
sale transaction bidders that included confidential financial and other information regarding WFB and the CLUB to assist potential
bidders in their evaluation of a CLUB sale transaction. Separately, the Company also worked to finalize the five year forecasts, taking
into account Project Apex and Vision 2020.

On January 21, 2016, the Board held a special meeting. Members of management and representatives of Koley Jessen,
Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities were present for portions of the meeting. During the meeting, Mr. Millner provided the
Board with an update of the preliminary results for fiscal year 2015 and the start of 2016. The Company’s management, together with
representatives of Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities, updated the Board on the status of the strategic alternatives review,
including the status of the confidentiality agreement negotiations as well as the introductory CLUB management presentations that
took

place earlier in the month. Management then discussed with the Board the implementation of Vision 2020 and Project Apex and
reviewed with the Board the proposed budget for fiscal year 2016. Management noted that they were completing the full five year
projections and expected to present the five year projections to the Board at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting. Following
review and discussion, the Board approved the 2016 budget.

On February 8, 2016, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting. Members of management and representatives of Koley
Jessen, Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities were present for portions of the meeting. Representatives of Sidley Austin discussed
with the Board the fiduciary duties of the members of the Board in considering potential strategic alternatives. Following this
discussion, members of management reviewed with the Board the Vision 2020 plan, including the five-year projections for the
Company. Management discussed the key assumptions used in the projections, including that the projections assumed a steady
economic environment over the next five years and did not include a recession. It was also noted that certain expected benefits of
Project Apex and Vision 2020 were included in the projections. Management and the Board also discussed areas of potential upside
and downside that were not reflected in the plan and the areas that were subject to the greatest sensitivity. Following this discussion, the
Board approved the strategic plan, including the five year projections. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities reviewed with the
Board the status of the strategic alternatives review, including an update of the discussions with potential CLUB sale transaction
bidders that occurred in January, the virtual data room for the CLUB had been opened, next steps on the CLUB sale transaction auction
process, the status of discussions with potential retail bidders and next steps with respect to a potential retail transaction. Management
noted that Guggenheim Securities would discuss with the Board at the next Board meeting preliminary financial perspectives regarding
potential strategic alternatives. The Compensation Committee also held a regularly scheduled meeting at which members of
management and representatives of Koley Jessen and Sidley Austin were also present. At the meeting, the Compensation Committee
discussed concerns regarding retention of key employees of WFB, in particular in the event that there was a change of control of WFB
in a CLUB sale transaction but not a change of control of the Company. It was noted that the existing arrangements did not address this
scenario and there were a number of key employees who were not party to any change of control severance arrangement for whom
management had retention concerns. Following discussion, the Committee approved the entry into “double trigger” change of control
severance agreements for key employees of WFB.

During February 2016, management of the Company and its advisors continued to work on the review of potential strategic
alternatives, including a financial review of each of the alternatives based on the Company’s projections and preparation of auctions for
a CLUB sale transaction and retail transaction. On February 17, 2016, at the direction of the Company, Guggenheim Securities
delivered a request for preliminary proposals to each of the potential bidders for a CLUB sale transaction seeking proposed economic,
operating and structural terms by March 16, 2016.

On February 19, 2016, the Board held a special meeting. Members of management and representatives of Koley Jessen,
Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities were present for portions of the meeting. Management updated the Board on developments
with respect to the strategic review process since the last meeting, including discussions with certain stockholders of the Company,
including EMC, in which these stockholders noted their continued belief that the Company should be sold, the state of the business,
and the continuing distraction of employees as a result of the strategic review process. Representatives of Sidley Austin and
Guggenheim Securities noted that the CLUB sale transaction request for preliminary proposals had been delivered to potential bidders
for the CLUB sale transaction and discussed the next steps with respect to auctions for both a CLUB sale transaction and a retail
transaction. Guggenheim Securities then discussed with the Board an overview of the strategic alternatives review conducted to date in
relation to: (i) the Company maintaining the status quo and continuing to execute on Vision 2020 and Project Apex, (ii) a
recapitalization, (iii) a real estate monetization either through an OpCo/PropCo transaction or a sale-leaseback transaction, (iv) an
acquisition of another business, (v) a CLUB sale transaction and (vi) a retail transaction. The Board, together with management and the
Company’s advisors, also discussed the challenges currently facing the Company and the likelihood that

the Company would be able to successfully execute on its strategic plan and the Board considered, among other things, that (1) a
recapitalization of the Company may provide stockholder value but would likely limit financial flexibility going forward, (2) the
OpCo/PropCo structure presented challenges for driving value because of, among other things, the limited size of the real estate
portfolio and while a traditional sale-lease back may be achievable, the Company had previously concluded that the economics of such
a transaction were not sufficiently attractive and (3) there appeared to be significant interest by potential bidders for a CLUB sale
transaction and by retail bidders for a retail transaction. The Board also considered concerns regarding the possibility of misalignment
of interests between the Company and a CLUB partner regarding the strategic direction of the CLUB and the Company if the Company
were to engage in a CLUB transaction and remain as a stand-alone public company. Other strategic benefits and potential challenges
relating to each of the alternatives were also discussed. Following this discussion, Guggenheim Securities discussed with the Board
certain preliminary financial perspectives regarding the various potential strategic alternatives. Following the review, the Board,
together with management and the Company’s advisors, discussed next steps in connection with the strategic review process, including
continued preparation for auctions for a potential CLUB sale transaction and potential retail transaction. It was noted that this
preparation would include the opening of a retail transaction data room and delivery of a confidential information memorandum to
potential retail bidders and a request for indications of interest from the potential bidders for a retail transaction. The Board authorized
the continued work on the exploration of potential strategic alternatives.

During the remainder of February 2016 and much of March 2016, management, together with representatives of Sidley
Austin and Guggenheim Securities, had discussions with the potential bidders for the CLUB sale transaction to help facilitate the
submission by the bidders of their proposals. Throughout this period, the Company and its advisors continued to work on the virtual
data rooms for both a CLUB sale transaction and a retail transaction as well as to prepare a confidential information memorandum for
the Company’s retail business in order to assist in the submission of indications of interest by the potential retail transaction bidders.

In mid-March 2016, seven potential bidders for a CLUB sale transaction submitted responses to the Company’s request for
proposals for a CLUB sale transaction. The remainder of the parties indicated they no longer had an interest in pursuing a potential
transaction. Throughout the remainder of March 2016, the Company, with the assistance of Guggenheim Securities, worked to assess
the financial and operational impact of each of the proposals. Following the submission of their initial proposals and discussions
regarding transaction structure and anticipated regulatory process, two of the CLUB bidders (which were viewed by the Board as
having the least attractive economic proposals) informed the Company they would not be proceeding further in the process. The
Company, with the assistance of Guggenheim Securities, finalized the process strategy for the second round of the CLUB sale
transaction auction process, including reverse regulatory due diligence, detailed operational due diligence and the next round of
bidding. Over the next several months, the Company provided more detailed financial, business and legal due diligence to the
remaining CLUB bidders and participated in due diligence meetings with the remaining CLUB bidders. On behalf of the Company,
representatives of Sidley Austin and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP (which we refer to as “Sullivan & Cromwell”), which was acting as
bank regulatory counsel to Guggenheim Securities at the time, also had calls with each of the remaining potential bidders for a CLUB
sale transaction to discuss various regulatory matters relating to each CLUB bidder. As a result of these calls, it was determined that
two of the potential CLUB bidders (which we refer to as “Financial Institution B” and “Financial Institution C”) would require
alternative transaction structures pursuant to which another financial institution would acquire the WFB deposits and ultimately assume
responsibility for making any Bank Merger Act (“BMA”) filing with its primary banking regulator. CONA discussed during its
regulatory due diligence call an anti-money laundering order it had entered into with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(which we refer to as the “OCC”) on July 10, 2015 (which we refer to as the “AML Consent Order”) which had been publicly
disclosed. CONA indicated that it did not believe that the AML Consent Order would prevent it from obtaining OCC approval on a
timely basis.

In early April 2016, the Company gave potential bidders for a retail transaction access to a virtual data room that included
high-level financial information with respect to the Company as well as the confidential

information memorandum prepared by the Company for the potential retail transaction. On April 12, 2016, at the direction of the
Company, Guggenheim Securities delivered to each of the remaining potential bidders for a retail transaction a letter requesting initial
indications of interest by May 4, 2016.

In early May 2016, the Company received nine indications of interest from interested retail bidders for an all-cash
acquisition of the Company. One of the indications of interest included a joint bid from Strategic Party C and one of the private equity
firms. The remaining six parties indicated they were no longer interested in a potential retail transaction. Private Equity Firm A
indicated a potential price per share range of between $65.00 and $70.00; Private Equity Firm B indicated a potential price per share
range between $60.00 and $65.00; Strategic Party A indicated a potential price per share range between $60.00 and $63.00; Parent,
which, with the permission of the Company, was partnering with an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co. to provide equity financing,
indicated a potential price per share range between $60.00 and $63.00, and noted that it may have the ability to pay more depending on
the outcome of certain due diligence; Private Equity Firm C indicated a potential price per share between $59.00 and $63.00; Private
Equity Firm D indicated a potential price per share of $61.00; Private Equity Firms E and F indicated a potential price per share of
$60.00 and Strategic Party B, which, with the permission of the Company, was partnering with Private Equity Firm G, indicated a
potential price per share between $55.00 and $60.00 and noted that a portion of its financing would potentially be the proceeds of an
equity issuance by Strategic Party B, which could require approval of its shareholders. Each of the proposals contemplated that the
retail bidder would partner with a CLUB bidder which would effect a CLUB sale transaction immediately prior to the bidder’s
acquisition of the Company via a merger. Each also contemplated that the bidder would require debt and/or equity financing to fund a
transaction.

During May 2016, the Company continued to work with each of the five remaining potential CLUB bidders and nine retail
bidders to provide additional due diligence information. The Company, together with its advisors, also discussed with Financial
Institution B and Financial Institution C the alternative CLUB sale transaction structures each was developing.

On June 6, 2016, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting. Members of management and representatives of Koley
Jessen, Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities were present for portions of the meeting. At the outset of the meeting, Mr. Cabela
recused himself from the meeting and Mr. McCarthy noted for the Board that Mr. Cabela had confirmed to Mr. McCarthy that if the
potential strategic alternatives review process resulted in the Board determining to sell the Company to Parent, or to any other potential
bidder if the potential bidder intended to move the Company’s headquarters out of Sidney, Nebraska, Mr. Cabela was not likely to vote
his shares of the Company in support of such a proposed transaction. Mr. Highby indicated he also would not be inclined to vote his
shares for such a transaction. The remaining directors indicated they did not have a similar predisposition. Mr. Highby then recused
himself from the meeting. The Board discussed procedures designed to mitigate the impact that Messrs. Cabela’s and Highby’s
predispositions would have on the strategic review process and determined that as long as Parent and any other bidders that were likely
to move the Company’s headquarters were involved in the process, Messrs. Cabela and Highby would not participate in portions of
Board meetings during which decisions regarding eliminating bidders were to be taken. It was noted that, given the terms of the initial
round of bids, management and the Company’s advisors were not recommending that any bidders be eliminated at this time. Messrs.
Cabela and Highby then rejoined the meeting. Sidley Austin discussed with the Board the fiduciary obligations of the Board members
in connection with reviewing potential strategic alternatives, including in connection with a potential sale of the Company.
Management then noted for the Board that management was providing presentations to each of the remaining retail bidders in June and
reviewed with the Board the draft management presentation to be provided to retail bidders, including additional potential savings
opportunities related to Project Apex. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities then reviewed with the Board the responses to the
Company’s request for preliminary proposals submitted by the CLUB sale transaction bidders, including the need of two of the bidders
for alternative CLUB sale transaction structures. It was noted that regulatory due diligence had been performed on all of the remaining
CLUB sale transaction bidders but that given the confidential supervisory nature of the matters, the Company was limited in the
amount of information it was able to obtain with respect to the

Table of Contents

regulatory status of each CLUB sale transaction bidder. The Board, together with management and the Company’s advisors, discussed
the adverse impact to closing certainty that would likely result from the alternative CLUB sale transaction structures because, among
other things, the structure involved an additional counterparty and the resulting risk that such additional counterparty may not perform
its obligations under the transaction agreements. The discussion then turned to potential next steps for the two auctions, including
timing of permitting the CLUB bidders to engage with the retail bidders to develop a comprehensive proposal, noting that the
economic terms that the CLUB bidders would provide would likely have a significant impact on the price per share that the retail
bidders would be willing to pay for the Company. Following that discussion, the Board authorized the Company and its advisors to
proceed with the auctions in a manner consistent with that discussed in the meeting. The Board discussed with representatives of Sidley
Austin regulatory matters with respect to the various retail bidders.

Over the next several weeks, management provided presentations to each of the remaining retail transaction bidders and the
retail bidders continued financial, business and legal due diligence. Also during June 2016, the remaining CLUB bidders, with the
exception of Financial Institution B which still had not produced a viable deposit-taking partner, conducted in person due diligence
sessions with management of the CLUB and they continued financial, business and legal due diligence. At the end of June 2016, each
of the remaining CLUB bidders was provided a draft of the credit card program agreement to govern the Company credit card program
following the sale of the credit card accounts and receivables to the applicable CLUB bidder.

On June 7, 2016, each of the remaining retail bidders was asked to submit a revised proposal on June 27, 2016 taking into
account the more detailed information and presentations they had received since their initial indications of interest in early May. On
June 24, 2016, each of the five remaining CLUB bidders was asked to submit a revised proposal by July 8, 2016, including a markup
of the draft credit card program agreement.

On June 27, 2016, Parent and Private Equity Firm F each submitted their revised proposals and on June 28, 2016, Private
Equity Firm E submitted its revised proposal. Each revised proposal contemplated an all cash transaction. Parent’s proposal indicated
(i) a potential purchase price per share of $63.00, with potential additional value once it had been provided access to diligence to
validate its synergies analysis, (ii) it would finance the transaction with debt financing and with equity financing from the Goldman
Sachs & Co. Merchant Banking Division (which we refer to as the “GSMBD”), and (iii) it anticipated any merger agreement would
contain customary closing conditions. Private Equity Firm E indicated (i) a potential price per share of $60.00, (ii) it expected to
finance the transaction with customary debt and equity financing and (iii) it expected the transaction would be subject to customary
closing conditions. Private Equity Firm F indicated (i) a potential price per share range of $63.00 to $64.00, (ii) it anticipated the
transaction would be financed from a combination of equity funding from one of its funds and potentially co-investments from certain
of its limited partners, customary debt financing and a sale-leaseback of the Company’s owned real estate, resulting in a rent-adjusted
leverage ratio of approximately 6.5x and (iii) the transaction would be subject to customary closing conditions. Private Equity Firm F’s
estimated leverage ratio was higher than the leverage ratio that Parent estimated in its proposal. The other retail bidders that submitted
proposals in May did not submit second round proposals. Over the course of the next several days, at the direction of the Company,
Guggenheim Securities held discussions with each of the parties that submitted first round bids but had not submitted second round
proposals to determine their reasons for declining to submit a second round proposal.

On July 5, 2016, the Board held a special meeting. Members of management and representatives of Koley Jessen, Sidley
Austin and Guggenheim Securities were present for portions of the meeting. Management provided an update to the Board regarding
the management presentations and due diligence that had taken place. Sidley Austin then discussed with the Board the fiduciary
obligations of its members in connection with the strategic review process, including their obligations should they ultimately determine
to undertake a sale of the Company. Following this discussion, Messrs. Cabela and Highby recused themselves from the meeting
consistent with the Board’s prior determination. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities then reviewed with

the Board the revised financial terms of the proposals for a retail transaction. It was noted that Private Equity Firm E was behind the
two other retail bidders in terms of amount of work to be completed and was working to determine whether it could find additional
value in the Company’s real estate before proceeding with more detailed due diligence. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities also
discussed with the Board the reasons provided by the other first round retail transaction bidders for why they did not submit second
round proposals and noted that revised CLUB sale transaction proposals were expected on July 8, 2016 and that Financial Institution B
had not yet provided a willing purchaser for the WFB deposits. The Board, together with management and the Company’s advisors,
then discussed next steps with respect to the three retail bidders and the CLUB bidders, including inviting each of the remaining retail
bidders to the third round, permitting the retail bidders to begin negotiations with the remaining five CLUB bidders and providing the
retail bidders with a merger agreement for review and comment. Representatives of Sidley Austin then reviewed with the Board the
terms of the proposed initial draft merger agreement to be provided to the remaining retail bidders. They noted that the initial draft
merger agreement contemplated that:
 

 

•  simultaneous with the entry into the merger agreement, the Company would enter into agreements with the CLUB
bidder selected by the retail bidder as the retail bidder’s partner, and the merger agreement provided that if the CLUB
sale transaction contemplated by the merger agreement did not close, then the retail bidder would be required to take
all actions necessary to obtain bank regulatory approval for the merger to permit the retail bidder to own WFB;

 

 •  the retail buyer would be required to take any and all actions necessary to obtain other regulatory approvals;
 

 

•  financing would not be a condition to consummation of the merger and if the retail bidder did not consummate the
merger at the required time, the Company would be entitled to seek specific performance or terminate the merger
agreement and receive a termination fee from the retail bidder as well as pursue money damages against the retail
bidder; and

 

 

•  the Company would have the right under certain circumstances to respond to unsolicited proposals prior to the
approval of the Company’s stockholders of the merger agreement and, under certain circumstances (including
payment by the Company of a termination fee), terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an unsolicited
proposal that constituted a superior proposal under the merger agreement.

Sidley Austin also discussed with the Board certain regulatory considerations with respect to each of the remaining retail
bidders. In executive session, the independent directors authorized the Company to proceed with the strategic alternatives review
process.

Following the meeting, at the direction of the Board, Guggenheim Securities contacted each of the remaining retail bidders
and relayed next steps to them as discussed with the Board.

On July 8, 2016, each of the remaining five CLUB bidders submitted a revised proposal for a CLUB sale transaction,
including a markup of the credit card program agreement. Financial Institution B’s submission did not include a viable partner for the
purchase of the WFB deposits.

On July 11, 2016, the Board held a special meeting to discuss the revised CLUB proposals. Members of management and
representatives of Koley Jessen, Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities were present for portions of the meeting. Management, with
the assistance of Guggenheim Securities, reviewed each of the proposals with the Board. They noted that Financial Institution B had
not yet provided a viable partner for the purchase of the WFB deposits and recommended that Financial Institution B not be permitted
to have any discussions with retail bidders until it had. The Board, together with management and the Company’s advisors, then
discussed the process for beginning negotiations between the retail bidders and the CLUB bidders to allow them to develop a
comprehensive proposal that included a CLUB sale transaction and a retail transaction. Recognizing the need for an efficient,
controlled and competitive process, the Board determined that the number

of CLUB bidders with which a retail bidder should be allowed to negotiate should be more than one to promote competition, but
limited to ensure efficiency and control. Accordingly, the Board authorized Guggenheim Securities to permit each retail bidder to
review all of the CLUB proposals (other than that of Financial Institution B) and select two of the four CLUB bidders with which to
negotiate.

Following the Board meeting, at the direction of the Board, Guggenheim Securities contacted each of the remaining retail
bidders and the four CLUB bidders and described the anticipated process. To permit these discussions, each of the applicable retail
bidders and the Company signed an amendment to the applicable retail bidder’s confidentiality and standstill agreement and each of the
applicable CLUB bidders and the Company signed an amendment to the applicable CLUB bidder’s confidentiality agreement. The
amendments permitted each such retail bidder to have discussions with the applicable CLUB bidders it selected but prohibited them
from sharing the identity of the other parties in the process.

Parent selected CONA and Financial Institution C (which at that time was working with Synovus for the purchase of the
WFB deposits in an alternative structure) and Private Equity Firm F selected CONA and Financial Institution E. Financial Institution A
was informed that none of the retail bidders had selected Financial Institution A to negotiate with it, and that at this time, it would not
progress further in the process. Private Equity Firm E elected not to engage with any of the CLUB bidders at this point given its view
that it needed to find additional value in the Company before it would explore any other aspects of the possible transaction. Over the
course of July and August 2016, Parent and Private Equity Firm F negotiated the credit card program agreement and the terms of the
program with the selected CLUB bidders. Also during this time, the CLUB bidders and retail bidders continued due diligence on the
CLUB and the Company and members of management had several in-person meetings with each of the bidders regarding due diligence
and related matters.

On July 28, 2016, the Company issued its earnings release for the second quarter of 2016. The release noted that, among
other things, while same store sales were up 1.5% compared to the second quarter of 2015, gross margin was 32.9% in the second
quarter of 2016, a decrease of 2.9% from 35.8% in the second quarter of 2015.

On August 9, 2016, the Board held a special meeting. Members of management and representatives of Koley Jessen and
Sidley Austin were present for portions of the meeting. Sidley Austin noted for the Board that Guggenheim Securities had disclosed to
the Company Guggenheim Securities’ relationships with each of the remaining bidders. Sidley Austin noted that management of the
Company and Sidley Austin had considered such information and believed that the limited level of relationships that Guggenheim
Securities had with the bidders would not be inconsistent with the Board concluding that Guggenheim Securities would be able to
render independent financial advisory services to the Board and would not impair Guggenheim Securities’ ability to render an impartial
opinion in connection with a combination transaction with such bidders. Sidley Austin noted that such information would be made
available to the Board as well and asked that any members with questions regarding the information contact management of the
Company or representatives of Sidley Austin. Management then updated the Board on the status of the discussions with the CLUB
bidders and retail bidders and potential timing for submission of final bids.

On August 12, 2016, Mr. McCarthy updated the Board via memorandum of two developments. First, that the Company had
received a letter from EMC addressed to the Board indicating that EMC believed a near-term sale of the entire Company was the
absolute best outcome for shareholders of the Company. Mr. McCarthy noted he intended to contact EMC to discuss entering into a
confidentiality agreement with EMC to provide it some insight into the process. Second, Mr. McCarthy informed the Board that Private
Equity Firm F had informed the Company that Private Equity Firm F was concerned about the amount of expenses it was incurring in
evaluating a potential retail transaction and that it understood from various sources that Parent was likely to outbid any proposal
Private Equity Firm F would make and accordingly if Private Equity Firm F were to continue to remain in the process it wanted the
Company to agree to reimburse its expenses. Mr. McCarthy noted that given the limited number of retail bidders and the importance of
keeping a competitive process, the

Company planned to enter into an agreement to reimburse Private Equity Firm F up to $5 million of expenses incurred under certain
circumstances. Finally, Mr. McCarthy noted that, consistent with prior discussions with the Board, the Company would soon inform
bidders of the deadline for submitting final bids.

On August 18, 2016, the Company entered into an expense reimbursement agreement with Private Equity Firm F pursuant
to which the Company would reimburse up to $5 million of Private Equity Firm F’s expenses related to its exploration of the retail
transaction under certain circumstances.

On August 19, 2016, at the direction of the Company, Guggenheim Securities informed each of the retail bidders that they
were to submit a final proposal no later than September 28, 2016, which was to include the final price per share proposed by the retail
bidder as well as final executed forms of all of the definitive agreements to be entered into to effect the acquisition of the Company as
well as the CLUB sale transaction documents with the CLUB bidder selected by the retail bidder in fully negotiated forms. To facilitate
the definitive agreements submitted on September 28th being in final form, the retail bidders were also instructed to submit markups of
the merger agreement and CLUB sale transaction agreements to the Company no later than September 9, 2016 so the parties could
negotiate the terms of the agreements (other than price per share) prior to the September 28th final proposal date. The timing
communicated to the retail bidders also was communicated to the CLUB bidders.

Throughout the remainder of August and through September 2016, the CLUB bidders and retail bidders worked on
completing their due diligence and negotiating between themselves the agreements for the CLUB sale transaction. The Company also
provided each of the bidders an updated fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial forecast for the Company based on year-to-date
results. During this period, the Company continued to provide the retail bidders with updates on the Company’s financial performance,
noting that comparable store sales and merchandise gross margins were down relative to the same period in the prior year and were
trending below the Company’s strategic plan. During this period, Private Equity Firm F noted to the Company’s advisors that its
prospective financing sources had expressed concern regarding negative trends in the Company’s business and had requested additional
information regarding the Company. In response, the Company and its advisors worked to provide this information.

In late August 2016, Private Equity Firm F requested the ability to engage with Financial Institution C with respect to a
CLUB sale transaction. The Company decided to permit Private Equity Firm F to engage in negotiations with Financial Institution C,
and in order to ensure an equitable process, also allowed Parent to engage in negotiations with Financial Institution E. On August 30,
2016, Financial Institution C informed the Company that, for a number of reasons, Financial Institution C was withdrawing from the
process.

On September 3, 2016, Parent’s counsel for the CLUB sale transaction, Morrison & Forster LLP (which we refer to as
“MoFo”), delivered to Sidley Austin a markup of the sale and purchase agreement for the CLUB sale transaction. Over the course of
the next several days, Sidley Austin and MoFo discussed the terms of the markup as well as the prior markups of the credit card
program agreement. During those discussions, Sidley Austin reiterated to MoFo that the Company’s expectation was that the
conditions to closing of the CLUB sale transaction would be as limited as the conditions to closing in the merger agreement.

On September 9, 2016, Latham & Watkins LLP (which we refer to as “Latham”), M&A and finance counsel for Parent,
submitted to the Company a markup of the merger agreement and the schedules to the merger agreement. It noted that markups of the
CLUB sale transaction agreements would come separately from MoFo. A markup of the credit card program agreement and a
preliminary markup of the original bank purchase agreement was delivered by MoFo later on September 9, 2016.

Among other provisions, Parent’s markup of the merger agreement:
 

 
•  deleted the “hell or high water” regulatory provisions and provided that Parent would not be required to divest any

assets in order to obtain regulatory approvals;
 

47

Table of Contents

 
•  deleted the concept that if the CLUB sale transaction did not close Parent would be required to take all actions

necessary to obtain bank regulatory approval of the merger so it could own WFB following the merger;
 

 

•  retained the concept in the Company’s auction draft of the merger agreement that financing would not be a condition
to consummation of the merger but limited the Company’s right to seek specific performance of Parent’s obligation to
close to those circumstances in which Parent’s debt financing was funded (or would be funded if closing occurred);
and further provided that if the Company terminated the merger agreement and received a termination fee from Parent
equal to 2.5% of the equity value of the transaction, the Company would not be permitted to seek additional damages
even in the case of a willful breach;

 

 
•  provided that each of the executive officers and directors of the Company as well as certain to-be-determined large

stockholders of the Company would execute voting agreements agreeing to vote in favor of the merger; and
 

 

•  provided that a termination fee equal to 3.0% of the equity value of the transaction with Parent would be payable by
the Company if (a) the Company terminated the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal or (b) Parent
terminated because the Company’s board changed its recommendation to vote in favor of the proposed merger
because of an “intervening event”.

Private Equity Firm F did not submit markups of the merger agreement or the CLUB sale transaction documents on
September 9, 2016. Private Equity Firm F informed Guggenheim Securities that in light of the concern that Private Equity Firm F’s
prospective financing sources had previously expressed concerns regarding recent trends in the Company’s business, Private Equity
Firm F intended to attempt to advance its discussions with those financing sources and arrange commitments from them before
submitting markups of the auction drafts.

On September 10, 2016, Sidley Austin had a call with Latham to discuss several of the provisions in Parent’s markup as well
as to understand the financing Parent was contemplating. Latham indicated Parent contemplated that the debt portion of its financing
would be in the form of a secured credit facility and an asset backed credit facility and the equity portion of the financing would be
provided from GSMBD and funds affiliated with Pamplona Capital Management.

The following week, representatives of Sidley Austin and Koley Jessen had a number of discussions with counsel for
Messrs. Cabela and Highby regarding whether there were circumstances under which Messrs. Cabela and Highby would be willing to
vote for a transaction with Parent or Private Equity Firm F. The counsel indicated that if the bidder were to make certain commitments
regarding maintaining a presence in Sidney, Nebraska, following any potential transaction, then Messrs. Cabela and Highby would be
willing to vote their shares of Company stock in favor of such a transaction. Subsequent to these discussions, counsel for Messrs.
Cabela and Highby provided Sidley Austin and Koley Jessen a draft of the covenant that Messrs. Cabela and Highby requested the
winning bidder agree to.

On September 14, 2016, the Board held a special meeting to review the terms of the markups received from Parent.
Members of management and representatives of Koley Jessen, Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities were also present.
Mr. Millner began the meeting by reviewing with the Board the Company’s recent financial performance. He noted that same store
sales were down as was gross margin. Management discussed with the Board some of the potential reasons for the negative trends in
the business and what management was doing to attempt to mitigate these trends. Management also discussed with the Board potential
positive and negative factors that may affect the Company’s results in the fourth quarter of 2016, including that the Company continued
to execute on Project Apex and find additional areas of potential cost-savings. He also noted that each of the bidders had been provided
updated forecasts for the Company for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2016 based on year-to-date results and described such
forecasts to the Board. Sidley Austin then discussed with

the Board the information provided by Guggenheim Securities to the Company with respect to Guggenheim Securities’ relationship
with the remaining bidders, which information had previously been discussed with and made available to the Board. The
representatives of Sidley Austin reiterated their and management’s views as relayed to the Board on August 9, 2016. The Board noted
it was its determination as well that the limited level of relationships that Guggenheim Securities had with the bidders did not suggest it
would be unable to render independent financial advisory services to the Board or impair Guggenheim Securities’ ability to render an
impartial opinion in connection with a combination transaction with such bidders. Messrs. Cabela and Highby then recused themselves
from the meeting. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities then discussed with the Board the status of the discussions with each of
the potential bidders. They noted that Parent appeared to be moving quickly and working to comply with the September 28th proposal
date and that Parent appeared to be furthest advanced in its discussions with CONA with respect to the potential CLUB sale transaction
but was also working with Financial Institution E. They also noted that Private Equity Firm F had expressed concern regarding the
negative trends in the business as well as one or more concerns arising from its due diligence. The Board noted that Private Equity
Firm F had failed to comply with the requirement to submit a markup of the auction drafts by September 9th. The Guggenheim
Securities representatives explained that Private Equity Firm F had informed Guggenheim Securities that it had not yet arranged
commitments for the real estate portion of its financing and therefore was focusing on attempting to arrange such a commitment before
submitting markups of the auction drafts. They further noted that Parent appeared to be nearly complete with its due diligence.
Following discussion, representatives of Sidley Austin reviewed with the Board the draft markup of the merger agreement and CLUB
sale transaction documents received from Parent as well as the information Parent’s counsel provided regarding its financing. The
Board, together with the Company’s management and advisors, then discussed possible responses to the markup. The Board then
authorized the Company to negotiate with Parent and Private Equity Firm F should it provide markups of the draft agreements.

Consistent with the discussions with the Board, on September 17, 2016, Sidley Austin discussed with Latham the draft
merger agreement and provided guidance regarding how Parent could improve the terms of the draft merger agreement, including by
providing (i) that it would agree to certain levels of store divestiture and other remedies in order to address any regulatory concerns
raised by governmental agencies as well as pay a termination fee if the transaction did not close because of regulatory reasons, (ii) a
higher financing termination fee and the Company’s right to seek specific performance irrespective of whether Parent’s debt financing
was available and to be able to seek monetary damages in excess of a termination fee if Parent willfully breached the merger agreement
and (iii) for Parent to take on some of the burden in terms of facilitating the closing of the CLUB sale transaction. Latham agreed to
provide a revised draft of the agreement the following week. Sidley Austin also conveyed to Latham comments to the markups of the
CLUB sale transaction documents.

On September 19, 2016, at the request of Private Equity Firm F, Messrs. Cabela, McCarthy and Millner met with
representatives of Private Equity Firm F in New York. Private Equity Firm F indicated that if it were the winning bidder it would want
Mr. Cabela to sign a voting agreement in support of the transaction and it asked whether Mr. Cabela would be willing to become a part
of the investor group for the transaction and “roll-over” up to $100 million of his equity in the Company into equity of the acquiring
entity. Mr. Cabela did not take a position on either of these requests during the meeting. In addition, Private Equity Firm F requested
that the Company increase the expense reimbursement cap by $2 million to facilitate Private Equity Firm F completing the work
necessary to submit a final proposal and negotiate definitive agreements. Following the meeting, Mr. McCarthy updated the Board on
these developments, including that Mr. Cabela had not taken a position on either of the requests made of him and that the Company had
approved the request for the increase of the expense reimbursement cap for the same reasons it initially agreed to the expense
reimbursement.

On September 20, 2016, Parent delivered a revised markup of the merger agreement. Also on September 20, Private Equity
Firm F provided an initial preliminary markup of the merger agreement but did not deliver a markup of the credit card program
agreement or the original bank purchase agreement.

Table of Contents

The revised Parent markup provided:
 

 
•  for a financing reverse termination fee payable by Parent of 5.0% of the equity value in the transaction but otherwise

retained Parent’s prior position on the Company’s specific performance rights and inability to seek damages in excess
of the termination fee;

 

 
•  that Parent was not required to agree to any divestiture or other remedies in order to obtain antitrust regulatory

approvals but would pay a reverse termination fee of 2.5% of the equity value of the transaction if the transaction did
not close because of antitrust regulatory matters; and

 

 
•  for reasonable cooperation by Parent in connection with the consummation of the CLUB sale transaction but provided

that if the CLUB sale transaction was not consummated the merger would not close and deleted the concept that
Parent would be required to take all actions necessary to obtain bank regulatory approval to own WFB.

The markup from Private Equity Firm F included a number of footnotes of additional provisions that may be necessary
following completion of Private Equity Firm F’s due diligence. The markup, among other things:
 

 
•  deleted the concept that if the CLUB sale transaction did not close Private Equity Firm F would be required to take all

actions necessary to obtain bank regulatory approval of the merger so it could own WFB following the merger;
 

 
•  noted that part of the financing to fund the acquisition would be in the form of a sale-lease back transaction but that

the provisions necessary to implement this concept would be added to a later markup;
 

 

•  retained the auction draft concept that financing would not be a condition to consummation of the merger, but did not
provide an amount of the termination fee payable by Private Equity Firm F if it did not consummate the merger when
required and limited the Company’s right to seek specific performance to those circumstances when the debt
financing was funded (or would be funded if closing occurred) and provided that if the Company terminated the
merger agreement and received the termination fee, the Company would not be permitted to seek monetary damages
even in the case of a willful breach;

 

 
•  provided that certain to-be-determined large stockholders of the Company would execute voting agreements agreeing

to vote in favor of the merger; and
 

 
•  did not include the amount of the termination fee payable by the Company if it terminated the merger agreement to

accept a superior proposal.

On September 21, 2016, Parent provided the Company with a revised markup of its credit card program agreement with
CONA. The markup included, among other things, provisions that would provide CONA the right to terminate the credit card program
agreement prior to consummation of the sale of the CLUB accounts to CONA (which would trigger a termination of the sale and
purchase agreement for the CLUB sale transaction under certain circumstances).

Over the course of the next several days, Sidley Austin had separate discussions with Latham and counsel for Private Equity
Firm F regarding their respective markups and areas in which they should modify their markups. During one of those discussions
counsel for Private Equity Firm F informed Sidley Austin that the sale-leaseback financing contemplated by Private Equity Firm F
would not be “backstopped” by a bridge financing facility.

On September 28, 2016, Private Equity Firm F informed Guggenheim Securities that it had not yet been able to complete
commitments for the real estate-related portion of the financing commitments that Private Equity Firm F needed to finance a potential
retail transaction. Therefore, it indicated, it would not be able to submit a final proposal on September 28th, but it was still working
towards submitting a final proposal.

On September 28 and 29, 2016, Parent submitted its complete proposal for its acquisition of the Company for a purchase
price per share of $65.00, including revised markups of the merger agreement and schedules and the purchase and sale agreement and
credit card program agreement for the CLUB sale transaction, drafts of the preferred equity commitment letter from GSMBD and
Pamplona and debt commitment letters. The proposal indicated that it would expire if the Company did not agree by Friday,
September 30 to an agreement to negotiate exclusively with Parent and CONA.

On September 30, 2016, the independent directors and Mr. Millner held a call with representatives of Koley Jessen, Sidley
Austin and Guggenheim Securities to discuss the markups received from Parent, the fact that Private Equity Firm F had not submitted a
final proposal and next steps. Mr. Millner began by reviewing for the directors the condition of the business since the last Board call,
noting that sales had improved but that some of the improvement was a result of promotions and that the Company continued to see
accelerated pressure on margin rates. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities then described for the directors the conversations it
had with Private Equity Firm F, noting that Private Equity Firm F indicated it had not yet obtained commitments for the real estate
portion of its financing but was working to submit a final proposal. The Board discussed that while Private Equity Firm F indicated it
was working to submit a final bid, it was unclear whether Private Equity Firm F would submit a final proposal in the near term or at all.
Representatives of Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities then described for the directors the terms of Parent’s proposal. Following
the description, the directors discussed with the Company’s advisors next steps in the process. They discussed Parent’s request for
exclusivity, the likelihood of Private Equity Firm F submitting a complete and acceptable proposal in the near term, the terms of
Parent’s proposal and the concern that if Parent were to believe that it was the only bidder that submitted a proposal by the bid
deadline, it may adversely impact the Company’s ability to reach acceptable terms with Parent. The directors determined that the
Company should inform Parent that the Company would not grant exclusivity to Parent but would work with Parent to attempt to reach
a signed deal by October 3, 2016 if Parent would improve its antitrust risk sharing provisions (including by agreeing to divestitures up
to an agreed standard in order to obtain antitrust approval). As part of the negotiation, the Board also determined that Guggenheim
Securities should request that Parent increase its proposal from $65.00 per share to $67.00 per share.

Following the meeting, Guggenheim Securities contacted JPMorgan Securities LLC (which we refer to as “JPMorgan”),
the financial advisor for Parent, and relayed the directors’ message, including an increase in Parent’s purchase price per share to
$67.00. At the direction of the Board, Guggenheim Securities also informed JPMorgan that Messrs. Cabela and Highby had informed
the Company they would not agree to voting agreements unless Parent agreed to certain maintenance covenants with respect to post-
closing Company operations in Sidney, Nebraska. Throughout the course of the day, Guggenheim Securities and JPMorgan had
discussions regarding these and other terms. Following several discussions, Parent said it was willing to increase its price per share to
$65.50, would increase the antitrust reverse termination fee to 4.5% of the equity value of the transaction and would agree that it would
not require exclusivity and would instead work to sign definitive agreements before the markets opened on October 3, 2016 but was
not willing to agree to the requirement to make divestitures to obtain regulatory approval or the post-closing maintenance covenants
proposed by Messrs. Cabela and Highby.

Over the next few days, the Company, Parent and CONA, with the assistance of their respective advisors, negotiated the
terms of the transactions and worked to finalize the transaction agreements. During these negotiations, the Company agreed to the
provision that Parent would not be required to divest any stores in order to obtain antitrust approval in exchange for Parent increasing
the antitrust termination fee to 5.0% of the equity value of the transaction and CONA agreed to remove most of the pre-closing credit
card program agreement termination triggers. Also during this period, the parties negotiated the voting agreements to be entered into by
the directors of the Company other than Messrs. Cabela and Highby, and discussed a possible provision that could be included in a
separate form voting agreement that Messrs. Cabela and Highby would be willing to enter into, which provision related to a statement
to be made by Parent in the press release announcing the transaction regarding Company operations in Sidney, Nebraska.

On the morning of October 2, 2016, the Board held a special meeting to consider the terms of Parent’s transaction
agreements. Members of management and representatives of Koley Jessen, Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities were also
present. Representatives of Sidley Austin discussed with the Board the fiduciary obligations of the members in connection with
considering a potential sale of the Company. Following this discussion, Messrs. Cabela and Highby recused themselves from the
meeting. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities then reviewed with the Board the status of negotiations and discussions, noting
that Private Equity Firm F still had not submitted a proposal, had indicated it did not have financing commitments arranged and was
still working towards submitting a proposal, but could not commit to a timeframe in which it would be able to do so. Representatives of
Sidley Austin then discussed with the Board the terms of the draft agreements and the remaining open issues and potential responses.
Guggenheim Securities discussed with the Board preliminary financial aspects of Parent’s proposed merger consideration. The Board,
together with management and the Company’s advisors, discussed whether to provide more time to Private Equity Firm F before
entering into a definitive transaction with Parent. The Board considered that (i) Parent’s proposal of $65.50 per share was $1.50 to
$2.50 per share higher than Private Equity Firm F’s last indication of a potential price per share range, which was $63.00 to $64.00, (ii)
since the time Private Equity Firm F submitted its last proposal in July, Private Equity Firm F had made several statements to
Guggenheim Securities regarding its concerns that the Company’s performance and due diligence matters would adversely impact
Private Equity Firm F’s valuation of the Company, (iii) Private Equity Firm F had not submitted a bid by the September 28, 2016
deadline, (iv) Private Equity Firm F had informed Guggenheim Securities that it had not yet been able to arrange financing
commitments for the real estate portion of its financing and (v) while Private Equity Firm F indicated it was still working to submit a
final bid, it did not provide a definitive date by which it would submit a final bid and there was no assurance that if Private Equity Firm
F were to submit a final bid it would be more favorable than Parent’s bid. Following the review and discussion, the Board authorized
the Company and its advisors to continue negotiations and agreed to reconvene that night to consider the potential transaction.

Throughout the remainder of October 2, 2016, the Company, Parent and CONA, with the assistance of their respective legal
advisors, worked to finalize the transaction documents. In addition, Messrs. Cabela and Highby agreed to enter into voting agreements
with Parent on identical terms as the other directors, except that their voting agreements would also include language regarding the
statements Parent would make in its press release announcing the transaction with respect to post-closing operations in Sidney,
Nebraska.

Later on October 2, the Board reconvened to consider the proposed transaction. Members of management and
representatives of Koley Jessen, Sidley Austin and Guggenheim Securities were also present. Representatives of Sidley Austin
reviewed with the Board their fiduciary obligations in considering a sale of the Company. Representatives of Sidley Austin also
reviewed with the Board the outcome of the remaining open issues on the transaction agreements. The Board discussed the various
strategic alternatives that had been reviewed, including continuing to operate as a standalone company. Also at this meeting,
Guggenheim Securities reviewed its financial analysis of the merger consideration contemplated by the original merger agreement with
the Board and rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated October 2, 2016, to the Board as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of such opinion, of the merger consideration contemplated by the original
merger agreement to be received in the merger by holders of Company common stock, which opinion was based on and subject to the
matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review
undertaken as described in such opinion. Following discussion, the Board concluded that the entry into the merger agreement and the
related definitive agreements was the best potential strategic alternative available to the Company and in the best interest of the
stockholders of the Company, including relative to the other strategic alternatives reviewed by the Board. The Board adopted and
approved the entry into the merger agreement, the CLUB sale and purchase agreement, the CLUB credit card program agreement, the
voting agreements and the other transaction documents.

Following the meeting, the Company, Parent and CONA, with the assistance of their respective legal advisors, worked to
finalize the transaction documents. On the morning of October 3, 2016, prior to the opening

of the U.S. stock exchanges, (i) (A) the Company, Parent and Sub entered into the merger agreement, (B) the Company, CONA and
WFB entered into the CLUB sale and purchase agreement, (C) CONA and the Company entered into the program agreement which
would govern the terms of the credit card program of the Company following closing of the merger and (D) the directors signed their
respective voting agreements and (ii) the Company, Parent and CONA issued press releases announcing execution of the transaction
documents. The press releases indicated that the parties expected to consummate the transactions in the first half of 2017, subject to
satisfaction of applicable closing conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.

On October 25, 2016, the Company and Parent filed their respective notification and report forms under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (which we refer to as the “HSR Act”), with the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (which we refer to as the “DOJ”) and the United States Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the
“FTC”), which triggered the start of the HSR Act waiting period. The statutory waiting period was originally scheduled to expire on
November 25, 2016.

On November 3, 2016, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, legal counsel to CONA (which we refer to as “Wachtell”),
informed Sidley Austin that CONA now believed that, while it still expected to obtain approval under the BMA of the transactions
contemplated by the CLUB sale and purchase agreement, such approval would be later than the timeframe initially announced by the
parties and CONA could not provide any assurances as to the timing of such approval. Wachtell indicated that the delay related to the
AML Consent Order and the acceptability to the OCC of CONA’s progress regarding the remediation efforts required by the AML
Consent Order. Wachtell also indicated that CONA believed it would be advisable to delay filing the BMA application for the CLUB
sale transaction, which pursuant to the terms of the CLUB sale and purchase agreement was required to be filed no later than
November 17, 2016. Wachtell stated that CONA now believed that if the BMA application were filed on November 17, the OCC
would deny the application in early January. Over the course of the next several days, the Company, CONA, Parent and their respective
legal advisors discussed the reasons CONA believed the BMA approval would be delayed, the potential timeframe for approval as well
as potential alternatives that could allow the BMA approval to be obtained within the time frame originally announced by the parties
with respect to the expected completion of the transactions.

On November 7, 2016, the Board held a special meeting to discuss the status of the transactions. During an executive
session for which certain members of management and representatives of Sidley Austin and Koley Jessen were present, management
and Sidley Austin discussed with the Board the conversations with CONA. They noted that it was unclear whether CONA would be
able to obtain BMA approval before the October 3, 2017 outside date but that CONA and Wachtell had reiterated CONA’s commitment
to continuing to work to consummate the transactions by the outside date. They noted that because the issues involved confidential
supervisory information between CONA and the OCC, the Company and its representatives had not received information directly from
(or had conversations with) the OCC regarding the AML Consent Order or its impact on any BMA application and it was unlikely that
the bank regulators would provide any information directly to the Company or permit the Company to be present in meeting or
discussions with CONA and the bank regulators. The Board, management and the Company’s advisors discussed (a) the desire of the
Company to consummate the transactions as contemplated by the CLUB sale and purchase agreement and the merger agreement signed
in October 2016 and (b) the need to consummate the transactions before the outside date. Management and the Company’s advisors
described for the Board the steps CONA indicated it could take to attempt to reduce the length of the delay and potential alternative
transaction structures that might permit the transaction to close within a timeframe closer to what the parties originally announced,
including an alternative series of transactions in which another financial institution would acquire substantially all of the assets of
WFB, including the deposits and then sell the credit-card related assets to CONA (which we refer to as “alternative structure option
1”). The Board also discussed that while the Company desired to consummate the transactions on the terms set forth in the transaction
documents, if CONA did not appear to be able to do so, the Company should (subject to its contractual obligations) explore other
potential avenues that might allow the Company to consummate the Merger prior to the outside date, which potential alternatives could
include an alternative transaction structure involving CONA that might be more acceptable to the regulators or finding another

potential buyer for the CLUB assets. Sidley Austin reviewed with the Board the provisions in the CLUB sale and purchase agreement
that prohibited the Company from soliciting alternative CLUB transactions with financial institutions other than CONA and the
situations under which the Company would have the right to terminate the CLUB sale and purchase agreement. The Board,
management and the Company’s advisors discussed the potential that the Board may determine that the Company should seek legal
remedies against CONA and the advisability of retaining a law firm specializing in litigation against financial institutions to help the
Board evaluate the viability of any claims that the Company might have against CONA and to pursue such claims if directed to do so
by the Board. The Board authorized management to continue to work to attempt to find ways to consummate the transactions within
the timeframe originally announced by the parties, including alternative transaction structures involving CONA.

During November 2016, the Company, Parent and CONA continued to discuss the impact that the timing of CONA’s AML
Consent Order remediation efforts would have on the timing of receiving BMA approval. CONA’s representatives reiterated CONA’s
commitment to continuing to work to consummate the transactions before the outside date and indicated that CONA would continue its
efforts to receive BMA approval within that timeframe, although they noted no assurances could be given in that regard. They also
reiterated that CONA believed that delaying the filing of the application was the best path to ultimately obtaining the necessary BMA
approval but indicated that CONA would proceed with filing the BMA application as required by the CLUB sale and purchase
agreement absent receiving a consent from the Company to delay the filing. The Company also discussed with Parent various potential
alternative structures involving CONA that might permit the parties to close the Merger within a timeframe closer to that originally
announced by the parties. It was expected that all of these structures would require amendments to the transaction documents,
including the merger agreement. Parent’s representatives indicated that Parent also believed that the alternative structures, other than
alternative structure option 1, introduced substantial post-merger regulatory risk to Parent, potential additional costs and potential for
degradation to the projected economics for Parent under the post-closing CLUB credit card program arrangement and that it was not
willing to agree to any such structures without being made whole for these additional risks and costs. Sidley Austin informed Wachtell
that it was having discussions with Parent regarding potential alternative structures; however, Parent had expressed a number of
concerns with respect to the potential alternative structures and that it would likely require being made whole for any costs it suffered
and for any degradation to the projected economics (including lost revenue under the post-closing credit card program arrangement)
arising from the alternative structure as compared to the original transaction with CONA.

Also during November 2016, the Company retained Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP (which we refer to as “Quinn
Emanuel”) to provide litigation advice with regard to the transaction. The Company also retained Sullivan & Cromwell to assist with
evaluation of strategies with respect to bank regulatory matters.

On November 15, 2016, Wachtell formally requested, on behalf of CONA, that the Company provide CONA a waiver under
the CLUB sale and purchase agreement to permit CONA to delay filing the BMA application with the OCC beyond the November 17
date contemplated by the CLUB sale and purchase agreement. Wachtell indicated that CONA believed delaying the filing of the
application was the best path ultimately to obtaining the necessary BMA approval.

After discussions with Parent, on November 17, 2016, the Company determined that while it was unclear based on the
information it had at the time that delaying the filing would in fact increase the likelihood that the BMA application would be approved
or would be approved on a faster timeframe, it would be willing to permit CONA to delay filing the application, but only if CONA
agreed, among other things, that:
 

 

•  until such time as CONA had provided evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company that CONA would be able to
make the BMA application and the OCC would process and approve the filing within a time frame that would permit
the parties to close prior to the outside date, the Company and Parent would be released from their obligations not to
solicit alternative CLUB transactions;

•  the Company would be permitted to enter into a conditional alternative CLUB purchase agreement and program

agreement so long as they did not become effective unless and until the CONA purchase agreement was terminated;
 

 
•  the Company would have the right to terminate the CLUB sale and purchase agreement with CONA if (i) CONA had

not made the BMA filing by December 31, 2016, (ii) the OCC requested that CONA withdraw the application or
rejected the application or (iii) the BMA application had not been approved by March 31, 2017; and

 

 
•  CONA would make the Company and Parent “whole” for costs they incurred pursuing and negotiating alternative

transactions and any loss in economics if the terms of the alternative transaction were not as favorable as the CONA
transaction.

Later that day, Wachtell informed the Company that CONA would not agree to the above terms and was therefore filing the
BMA application in accordance with the terms of the CLUB sale and purchase agreement.

On November 21, 2016, Sidley Austin, at the Company’s request, provided the Board an update on the status of discussions
with CONA regarding the BMA application and alternatives being considered to attempt to allow the transactions to be consummated
within the timeframe initially announced by the parties.

Also on November 21, 2016, Parent, with the consent of the Company and at the request of the FTC, notified the FTC that
Parent was withdrawing its HSR application effective as of November 25, 2016. The purpose of the withdrawal was to allow the FTC a
thirty day extension to continue to review the proposed merger before the expiration of the HSR waiting period with the goal that the
FTC would clear the proposed Merger during the 30 day extension and the parties would thereby avoid a lengthy second request
process. On November 29, 2016, Parent re-filed its HSR Act notification with the FTC and DOJ, which triggered a new waiting period
under the HSR Act that would expire on December 29, 2016, unless the DOJ or FTC granted early termination of the HSR Act waiting
period or formally requested additional information concerning the Merger.

At the request of Capital One Financial Corporation (which we refer to as “Capital One Financial”), on December 5, 2016,
Messrs. McCarthy, Millner, Castner and Scott K. Williams, President of the Company, held a meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with
Mr. Murray Abrams, Executive Vice President of Corporate Development of CONA, and Mr. Stephen Crawford, Head of Finance and
Corporate Development of Capital One Financial, and Mr. R. Scott Blackley, Chief Financial Officer of Capital One Financial. During
the meeting, Mr. Crawford indicated that he believed it was not likely that CONA would obtain BMA approval under the current
structure prior to the outside date. Mr. Crawford further stated that he believed if CONA did not withdraw the BMA application the
OCC would deny the application in early January. Mr. McCarthy reminded Mr. Crawford that the Company would not extend the
CLUB sale and purchase agreement outside date without a corresponding extension of the outside date in the merger agreement with
Parent and he did not believe that Parent would be willing to extend the outside date. Finally, Mr. Crawford indicated that CONA had
been working on alternative transaction structures and was willing to work with the Company and Parent on them with the goal of
increasing the likelihood of shortening the timeframe before the parties could consummate the proposed transactions.

Over the next few days, Sidley Austin and Wachtell discussed certain potential alternative transaction structures and on
December 9, 2016, Wachtell provided Sidley Austin and MoFo with a summary of potential alternative structures that CONA was
willing to consider. The structures were similar to those that the Company previously proposed to Parent in November.

On December 10, 2016, Sidley Austin sent comments to the summary of potential alternatives circulated by Wachtell, which
comments attempted to address a number of the concerns that Parent had previously indicated it had with the potential alternatives,
including to provide (a) the Company and Parent with

the ability to (i) solicit alternative CLUB transactions and (ii) terminate the CLUB sale and purchase agreement if the requisite bank
regulatory approvals were not obtained by specified dates and (b) that to the extent that the alternative agreement resulted in costs
suffered by or economic degradation of the projected economics for Parent as compared to the original transaction with CONA, CONA
would make whole Parent for those costs and that degradation.

On December 11, 2016, Mr. Crawford called Mr. McCarthy to discuss the Company’s modifications to the proposed
alternative structures. During the conversation, Mr. McCarthy reiterated that while the Company wanted to consummate the
transactions on the terms set forth in the transaction agreements signed in October 2016, if CONA was not able to do so, the Company
needed to find an alternative to allow it to consummate the Merger prior to the outside date. Further, he stated that the Company was
willing to work on alternatives that involved CONA but did not want to be in a position where the exploration of those alternatives did
not result in a solution and left too little time before the outside date for the Company to consummate a CLUB transaction with an
alternative CLUB buyer. Mr. Crawford indicated that CONA still wanted to close the CLUB transaction and that while they were
willing to consider an extension of the outside date or alternative transaction structures and terms, the “make whole” concept included
in the Sidley Austin markup was not acceptable to CONA and that any release from the exclusivity obligations would also require a
release by the Company of any potential claims against CONA.

On December 13, 2016, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting. Also present at the meeting were members of
management and representatives of Sidley Austin and Koley Jessen. During the meeting, management and representatives of Sidley
Austin discussed with the Board (a) the discussions with CONA, including Mr. Crawford’s statements on December 5th that he
believed it was not likely that the transaction on its current terms would be approved by the OCC prior to the outside date and that if
the BMA application were not withdrawn, the OCC would likely deny it in early January and (b) the Company’s efforts to find a
solution that would permit the transactions to close prior to the outside date, including the discussions that had taken place with CONA
and Parent on alternative transaction structures. The Board authorized the Company to continue to explore alternatives that would
provide for a CLUB transaction that could be closed prior to the outside date (and thereby permit the Company and Parent to
consummate the Merger prior to the outside date).

On December 21, 2016, Sidley Austin had a call with Wachtell to discuss the status of CONA’s review of the Company’s
December 10 comments to the potential alternatives circulated by Wachtell on December 9 and to discuss the FTC and bank regulatory
status of the transaction. During the call, Wachtell stated that CONA was planning to meet with the OCC in early January to discuss the
status of the BMA application. In response to Sidley’s request for a markup of the alternative structure proposals, Wachtell indicated
that Mr. Crawford had already conveyed CONA’s position on the Company’s proposal to Mr. McCarthy and that CONA did not believe
it was productive to further revise the written summary of potential alternative structures until those issues had been resolved and that
the parties should have further discussions after the meeting in early January with the OCC. Sidley Austin informed Wachtell that
based on discussions with the FTC, the Company expected to receive a second request from the FTC on December 29th.

On December 29, 2016, the Company and Parent received a second request from the FTC and on December 30, 2016, the
Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing the receipt of the second request and that CONA had informed
the Company that CONA believed it was not currently likely that it would receive BMA approval prior to the outside date.

On January 5, 2017, Mr. Crawford called Mr. McCarthy to update Mr. McCarthy on CONA’s meeting with the OCC on the
previous day. Mr. Crawford indicated that based on that meeting he believed that if the BMA application was not withdrawn it would
be denied on January 31st. Mr. Crawford also indicated that CONA and the OCC did discuss on a preliminary basis certain alternative
transaction structures, including alternative structure option 1. Mr. Crawford further indicated that he believed that a withdrawal was
the best path to ultimately receiving a BMA approval and that if the application was not withdrawn and the OCC denied the

application, he believed the OCC would be less receptive to discussing alternative structures. Messrs. Crawford and McCarthy
discussed the process were CONA to withdraw the BMA application and resubmit it at a later date once the AML Consent Order
remediation had been completed. Mr. Crawford indicated that CONA continued to believe that it could ultimately obtain BMA
approval but that due to the AML Consent Order he did not believe that CONA would obtain BMA approval prior to the outside date.

Also on January 5, 2017, Wachtell, Sidley Austin and Sullivan & Cromwell discussed the status of CONA’s BMA
application. Wachtell reiterated the information Mr. Crawford provided Mr. McCarthy during their call earlier that day and requested
that the Company permit CONA to withdraw the BMA application. The parties also discussed the various alternative structures.

On January 6, 2017, Sidley Austin, at the direction of the Company, informed Wachtell that the Company was willing to
grant CONA consent under the CLUB sale and purchase agreement to withdraw the BMA application under certain conditions. Sidley
Austin reiterated that while the Company wanted to close a transaction with CONA on the timeframe originally contemplated, the
Company did not want to be in a situation where it evaluated alternative transactions with CONA only to find that none of them were
viable and once that conclusion was reached, the Company did not have time to find an alternative CLUB purchaser that would be able
to gain bank regulatory approval within a time frame that would allow the transactions to close prior to the outside date. Accordingly,
in order to grant the consent under the CLUB sale and purchase agreement, the Company would require that CONA agree that the
Company and Parent could solicit alternative CLUB transaction proposals and be able to terminate the CLUB sale and purchase
agreement if the Company and CONA had not entered into agreements for an alternative transaction structure by February 15, 2017.

On January 8, 2017, Mr. Crawford called Mr. McCarthy to inform him that CONA would not agree to allow the Company
and Parent to solicit other CLUB buyers at that time. He further indicated that CONA would continue working on identifying potential
partners for alternative structure option 1 and that CONA wanted the Company to agree that CONA could withdraw the BMA
application before Capital One Financial’s January 24th earnings call.

On January 13, 2017, Sidley Austin and Wachtell held a call to discuss the status of CONA’s exploration of potential
financial institutions to participate in alternative structure option 1. Wachtell indicated that CONA was in the process of reaching out to
such parties.

On January 19, 2017, Mr. Crawford contacted Mr. McCarthy to inquire whether the Company had determined to permit
CONA to withdraw the BMA application. Mr. McCarthy informed Mr. Crawford that the Company had not seen substantial progress
on the alternative structures and without such progress the Company was not inclined to grant the withdrawal request.

On January 20, 2017, Messrs. Crawford and McCarthy discussed further CONA’s request for consent to withdraw the BMA
application. Mr. Crawford informed Mr. McCarthy that CONA had made progress with its initial outreach to financial institutions for
potential participation in alternative structure option 1 and reiterated his request for a waiver under the CLUB sale and purchase
agreement to permit CONA to withdraw the BMA application.

Also on January 20, 2017, Wachtell asked for permission from the Company for CONA to engage in more detailed
discussions with Synovus, who had previously been involved in the transaction auction process in 2016 as a potential partner with
Financial Institution C and was one of the financial institutions that Mr. Crawford previously identified to Mr. McCarthy. Over the next
several days, the Company, CONA and Synovus and their respective legal advisors negotiated confidentiality agreements and other
matters to permit CONA and Synovus to engage in such discussions regarding alternative structure option 1 and to share information
regarding the CLUB business with CONA.

Also during that time, Sidley Austin delivered to Wachtell a draft letter agreement that would permit CONA to withdraw the
BMA application in exchange for, among other things, permitting the Company and Parent to solicit alternative transactions if the
Company and CONA had not entered into an agreement for an alternative structure by February 21, 2017 and in such event to
terminate the CLUB sale and purchase agreement if after such date the Company found an alternative CLUB buyer.

On January 22, 2017, Wachtell indicated that CONA was unwilling to enter into the letter agreement on the terms set forth
therein and that the only withdrawal consent that CONA would accept was one without any conditions attached to it.

On January 24, 2017, Capital One Financial stated in its earnings call with respect to the year ended December 31, 2016 that
(a) it did not expect to obtain regulatory approval prior to the outside date and (b) within the next week or so it expected CONA would
either withdraw the BMA application (if permitted by the Company) or the application would be denied by the OCC. Capital One
Financial continued that in either case CONA would not be in a position to refile the application until after it had completed its
remediation work under the AML Consent Order. Capital One Financial also reiterated that it remained committed to the transaction
and would continue to work with the Company and Parent towards completing the transaction.

On January 25, 2017, the Board held a special meeting. Also present were members of management and representatives of
Sidley Austin, Sullivan & Cromwell, Quinn Emanuel and Koley Jessen. Management and the Company’s advisors updated the Board
on the status of the discussions with CONA and Parent, the exploration of alternative structures with CONA and the status of the bank
regulatory process. They noted that CONA and Synovus appeared to be engaged in substantive discussions on alternative structure
option 1 and that CONA had indicated those discussions appeared to be going well. The Board discussed CONA’s request for consent
to withdraw the BMA application, the alternatives available to the Company and potential range of outcomes of each alternative. Those
discussions included the potential timing and likelihood of CONA and Synovus entering into an alternative transaction that would
permit the parties to obtain bank regulatory approval and close such transaction and the Merger prior to the outside date, the potential
timing and likelihood of success of various potential claims the Company might have against CONA under the CLUB sale and
purchase agreement, both to terminate the CLUB sale and purchase agreement and/or for damages, and the likelihood and timing of
finding an alternative CLUB buyer on terms that would not require the consent of Parent. The Board also discussed the potential
adverse impact that a denial of the BMA application could have on the ability to obtain banking regulatory approval of an alternative
transaction structure involving CONA or a different financial institution. Following discussion, the Board agreed to meet again on
January 27th to make a determination on how to proceed with the CONA withdrawal request.

On January 27, 2017, Mr. McCarthy contacted Mr. Crawford to see whether CONA would ask the OCC to delay making a
decision by two or three weeks to allow the parties additional time to finalize a transaction with Synovus. Mr. Crawford said he would
not make such a request of the OCC. Mr. Crawford indicated to Mr. McCarthy that Mr. Crawford believed the discussions with
Synovus would result in an agreement but reiterated his view that if the BMA application was not withdrawn it would adversely impact
the ability of the parties to ultimately obtain BMA approval as well as the receptivity of the OCC to discussing alternative structures.
Mr. Crawford again reiterated that CONA wanted an unconditional consent to withdraw the BMA application.

Later on January 27, 2017, the Board met to consider the various alternatives available. Also present at the meeting were
members of management of the Company and representatives of Sidley Austin, Sullivan & Cromwell, Quinn Emanuel and Koley
Jessen. The Board, management and the Company advisors discussed the various alternatives, including potential litigation scenarios,
likelihood of success and the potential timing to conclude any litigation brought by the Company for termination of the CLUB sale and
purchase agreement or by CONA if the Company terminated the agreement and CONA challenged the termination. It was noted that
during the pendency of any such litigation it seemed unlikely that other potential CLUB buyers would be willing to

engage with the Company, meaning that the Company may not be able to begin substantive negotiations with other potential buyers
before the beginning of May at the earliest, leaving little time to negotiate with the new CLUB buyer and Parent the applicable
transaction documents, make the necessary bank regulatory applications and obtain the applicable bank regulatory approvals. The
Board also considered whether, if the Company were to engage in discussions with other potential CLUB buyers, the terms to which
those potential buyers would agree for a CLUB transaction and credit card program agreement would be sufficiently similar to the
existing CLUB transaction and credit card program agreement terms to permit the Company to enter into those agreements without
first obtaining Parent’s approval under the merger agreement. Mr. McCarthy and management also relayed to the Board the reports
from CONA that they were close to reaching a preliminary agreement with Synovus. The Board also discussed with management the
challenging business environment for retailers and the Company’s results since October 2016 and management’s views as to the likely
impact on the Company if the transaction agreements were terminated and the Company continued to operate on a stand-alone basis.
Following a discussion of the potential risks and benefits of each of the alternatives available to the Company, the Board determined
that, taking all of the facts into consideration, the Company’s best alternative was to pursue alternative structure option 1 with CONA
and Synovus as that alternative had the greatest likelihood of resulting in a transaction that could be completed prior to the outside date.
Accordingly, the Board authorized the Company to permit CONA to withdraw the BMA application. Later on January 27, Sidley
Austin informed Wachtell and Latham of the Board’s decision and that the Company would be providing CONA with a consent to
withdraw the BMA application.

On January 28, 2017, the Company provided CONA with the consent to withdraw the BMA application and the BMA
application was withdrawn.

Also on January 28, 2017, Wachtell delivered to Sidley Austin an executed copy of a non-binding letter of intent between
CONA and Synovus to effect alternative structure option 1.

On February 2, 2017, Messrs. Millner and Castner of the Company, Mr. Sean Baker, Executive Vice President and Chief
Executive Officer of WFB, Mr. James A. Hagale, President and Chief Operating Officer of Parent, representatives of GSMBD and
Mr. Crawford met in Capital One Financial’s offices. Mr. Crawford informed the Company, Parent and GSMBD that CONA had a
preliminary agreement with Synovus that he was confident could be finalized and provided the parties the best opportunity to close the
transaction prior to the outside date. However, Mr. Crawford stated that the Company and Parent needed to address two issues before
CONA was willing to proceed. First, he said that the Synovus letter of intent contemplated that Synovus would receive $75 million in
consideration in connection with the alternative structure. He indicated that CONA was unwilling to make that payment and the
Company and Parent would need to bear the costs. Second, he indicated that CONA wanted to amend the credit card program
agreement that the Company and CONA had entered into on October 3, 2016 and which would govern the credit card program of the
Company after closing of the merger. Mr. Crawford stated that amendment would change the provision that governed the amount of
revenue from the credit card program that CONA would share with Parent. In the executed program agreement, the provision
determined the revenue share based in part on LIBOR as of closing. CONA, he stated, wanted to amend the provision so that the
revenue share would be based instead on LIBOR as of the original signing date of October 3, 2016. Mr. Crawford stated that basing the
revenue share on LIBOR as of closing as the executed program agreement currently provided would have a significant adverse impact
on the amount of revenue that CONA would receive under the program relative to what CONA had included in its financial models.
Mr. Crawford concluded that CONA would continue to use efforts to attempt to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
original CLUB sale and purchase agreement but unless these two matters were addressed, CONA would not proceed with the Synovus
transaction and would not release the Company or Parent from their no-solicitation obligations with the likely result being that the
parties would not be able to consummate any transaction (with CONA or another party) prior to the outside date.

On February 6, 2017, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting. Also present for portions of the meeting were members
of management and representatives of Sidley Austin, Quinn Emanuel and Koley Jessen.

Management updated the Board on the February 2, 2017 meeting with Mr. Crawford. Mr. McCarthy described for the Board the
program agreement issue and the economic consequences of the change being proposed by CONA as he understood it. The Board
discussed potential alternatives with management and the Company’s advisors. It was the sense of the Board that the Company should
work with CONA and Parent on potential arrangements to address the issues raised by CONA. Also during this meeting, among other
things, the Board reviewed the Company’s 2017 budget. Management discussed with the Board how the budget differed from the
Company’s five year projections approved by the Board in February of 2016.

Over the next several weeks, the Company, Parent and CONA held numerous discussions regarding the issues raised by
Mr. Crawford and the progress with Synovus on alternative structure option 1. At the same time, CONA and Synovus continued to
work on the terms of the revised structure.

During the discussions between CONA and the Company, the Company addressed the two economic issues presented by
CONA at the February 2, 2017 meeting. The Company indicated that it would be willing to propose to the Board that the Company
provide the funds necessary to pay the consideration payable to Synovus and other transaction costs by lowering the purchase price
payable for the bank assets, with a corresponding reduction in the aggregate merger consideration payable under the merger agreement.
The Company further informed CONA that CONA needed to address the economic issues presented by its proposed program
agreement amendment directly with Parent. On February 11, 2017, CONA indicated that if the program agreement issue was not
addressed, the growth of the credit card program would be adversely affected and CONA believed that such a result would be worse
for both CONA and Parent. On February 13, 2017, with the Company’s consent, CONA and Parent held a meeting to discuss the credit
card program agreement. In the days following this meeting, Parent and the Company and their respective representatives discussed the
Company’s understanding of CONA’s requested credit card program agreement amendment and the likely impact on the post-close
business of the Company and Parent.

On February 15, 2017, Wachtell delivered to Sidley Austin a draft of the revised CLUB transaction agreement
contemplating the revised structure with Synovus. Over the course of the next two months, the Company, Parent, CONA and Synovus
and their respective representatives negotiated the transaction documents.

On February 16, 2017, the Company and Sidley Austin provided the Board with an update on the status of the discussions.

On February 19, 2017, the Company received a letter from Parent indicating that during the February 13, 2017 discussion
between CONA and Parent, CONA had indicated CONA was not willing to proceed with the Synovus transaction unless the program
agreement was amended to address CONA’s concerns with respect to the revenue sharing provisions. Parent indicated in the letter it
was not willing to agree to any such amendments to the program agreement as it believed doing so would substantially change the risk
profile of the transaction and materially reduce the value of the go-forward credit card program to Parent.

Over the next several days, Mr. McCarthy and members of management of the Company had discussions with CONA and
Parent regarding both issues presented by Capital One Financial at the February 2, 2017 meeting. These discussions resulted in a
proposal by the Company under which: (a) the Company would provide the funds necessary to pay $70 million of the $75 million
Synovus payment (with CONA paying the remaining $5 million) by lowering the purchase price payable for the bank assets, with a
corresponding $1.00 per share reduction in the per share merger consideration, and (b) CONA and Parent would agree upon a revised
rate for purposes of revenue sharing under the program agreement, and the per share merger consideration would be further reduced to
$61.50 per share to compensate Parent for the projected economic impact of the revised rate.

On February 22, 2017, the Board held a special meeting to discuss the proposal. Also present for the meeting were members
of management and representatives of Sidley Austin, Koley Jessen and Guggenheim Securities. Mr. McCarthy described for the Board
the proposal and summarized the various discussions he and

the Company had with CONA and Parent since the Board’s last meeting. He noted that following Parent’s rejection of CONA’s
proposal to adjust the revenue share provision in the program agreement, Mr. Crawford had indicated CONA would be willing to keep
the term as provided in the executed program agreement. Mr. McCarthy noted, however, that as a result of the discussions between
CONA and Parent, he believed that Parent appreciated that if the revenue share provision was not adjusted, it would likely adversely
affect the growth of the credit card program. Accordingly, Parent had a desire that the revenue share provision be lowered from what it
was under the current program agreement, but with a reduction in the per share merger consideration. Mr. McCarthy also noted that it
was not clear that if he pushed CONA to accept no change in the revenue share terms of the program agreement that (a) CONA would
do so without first attempting again to persuade Parent to agree to a lower rate, which could both (i) potentially damage the relationship
between Parent and CONA and thereby potentially decrease Parent’s willingness to be a 10-year partner with CONA under the
program agreement and its willingness to agree to the changes to the transaction documents necessary to effect the revised transaction
structure and (ii) delay the entry into the agreements to effect the revised transaction structure with Synovus thereby increasing the
possibility that the BMA approval for the revised transaction structure with Synovus would not be received by the outside date and
(b) Parent would not itself seek a modification in the program agreement revenue share provisions since he believed Parent now
appreciated the adverse impact that a high revenue share term could have on the growth of the credit card program. He also discussed
concerns regarding (1) the time remaining prior to the outside date and the need to have a signed transaction in the near term if there
were to be a chance to obtain regulatory approval prior to the outside date and (2) the performance of the Company’s business and the
risk that a continuing decline in performance could adversely impact the value of the Company resulting in Parent seeking to reduce
the merger consideration below $61.50. In this regard and in consideration of the need to complete a transaction prior to the outside
date, it was noted that on several occasions Parent had remarked to the Company that Parent was disappointed in the Company’s
financial and business performance since October 3, 2016. Representatives of Sidley Austin also discussed with the Board their
understanding of the feedback that Synovus and CONA had received from the bank regulators regarding the potential revised
transaction structure. Following discussion, the Board authorized the Company and its advisors to negotiate the terms of the transaction
documents to allow the Company to present to the Board a fully negotiated proposal. The Board then discussed the other preparations
that were necessary to allow the Board to fully consider the revised terms, including, among other things, updated five-year projections
reflecting the Company’s 2016 fiscal year performance and current outlook.

On February 27, 2017, Sidley Austin sent Latham a draft amendment to the merger agreement. The amendment
contemplated, among other things, (a) the change to the merger consideration and (b) an extension of the outside date to April 3, 2018.
Over the course of the next several weeks, the parties negotiated the merger agreement amendment and the revised CLUB transaction
agreements. During these negotiations, Parent indicated that it was not willing to extend the outside date. Also during this time, the
Company, CONA and Synovus continued to have discussions with their applicable bank regulators with respect to the potential revised
structure.

On March 2, 2017, the Board held a special meeting to discuss the progress on the revised transaction structure and to
consider the updated projections that the Company’s management had prepared. Also present for the meeting were members of
management of the Company and representatives of Sidley Austin, Koley Jessen and Guggenheim Securities. The Sidley Austin
representatives updated the Board on the negotiations with the parties on the transaction documents as well as the status of the bank
regulatory discussions and the progress on responding to the FTC’s second request and the outlook of the FTC’s review. Management
then presented to the Board the updated five-year projections and compared for the Board the assumptions and inputs used in preparing
the updated five-year projections from the projections approved by the Board in 2016. Following discussion, the Board approved the
2017 five-year projections.

Over the next two weeks the parties continued to negotiate the transaction documents.

On March 16, 2017, the Board held a special meeting to discuss in further detail the proposed terms of the revised
transaction. Also present were members of management of the Company and representatives of

Sidley Austin, Koley Jessen and Guggenheim Securities. Representatives of Sidley Austin reviewed with the Board their fiduciary
duties in considering the proposed transaction agreements. Representatives of Guggenheim Securities then discussed with the Board an
update of the information provided by Guggenheim Securities to the Company with respect to Guggenheim Securities’ relationships
with potential transaction counterparties. Following review and discussion, the Board determined that based on the information
discussed with the Board, Guggenheim Securities did not have any relationships with any of the transaction counterparties that could
reasonably be considered material with respect to Guggenheim Securities’ engagement in connection with the transaction.
Representatives of Sidley Austin then reviewed with the Board the terms of the proposed revised CLUB transaction documents and the
proposed amendment to the merger agreement. The review included a comparison of the terms of the proposed CLUB transaction
documents to the original CLUB transaction documents, including with respect to termination rights, level of conditionality, level of
regulatory efforts the parties had to undertake to complete the transaction and the additional termination fees that may be payable by
the Company. The Sidley Austin representatives also reviewed with the Board the terms of the amendment to the merger agreement,
noting that Parent had rejected the request for an extension to the outside date. The Sidley Austin representatives then discussed with
the Board the status of the FTC antitrust review and the bank regulatory approval process, reviewing both the potential timing to obtain
potential approval and the potential likelihood of approval based on the information as they understood it. They also discussed the
process that Synovus wanted to go through with the Federal Reserve Board (the “FRB”) before Synovus would be willing to sign the
transaction documents, noting that the plan was for Synovus to submit the documents to the FRB once they were finalized.
Representatives of Guggenheim Securities then discussed with the Board preliminary financial perspectives regarding the potential
transaction. During this discussion, representatives of Company management and Guggenheim Securities noted for the Board that
certain of the forecasted line items and assumptions used in the preliminary financial perspectives had been updated or changed from
those used in the financial presentation provided by Guggenheim Securities to the Board in connection with the October 2, 2016 Board
meeting. The Guggenheim representatives discussed with the Board the effect of such updates. The Board asked questions regarding
such updates which the representatives of Guggenheim Securities answered. The Board, management and the Company’s advisors then
discussed next steps, including finalizing the transaction documents in order for them to be submitted to the FRB by Synovus.

Over the next week, the parties worked to finalize the transaction agreements. On March 24, 2017, Synovus submitted the
draft CLUB transaction agreements to the Atlanta FRB. Synovus reported to the Company that over the next few weeks Synovus and
the Atlanta FRB held several discussions.

On April 3, 2017 the Company certified substantial compliance with the FTC’s ‘second request’ and on April 14, 2017
Parent so certified substantial compliance.

Following the conclusion of the meetings and discussions between Synovus and the Atlanta FRB, Synovus informed the
Company that Synovus had determined it had sufficient information to enter into the proposed transaction documents. The parties
agreed that subject to approval by the Board, they would execute and deliver the revised CLUB transaction agreements and the
amendment to the merger agreement on April 17, 2017.

On April 17, 2017, the Board held a special meeting to consider the proposed terms of the revised transaction. Also present
were members of management of the Company and representatives of Sidley Austin, Sullivan & Cromwell, Koley Jessen and
Guggenheim Securities. Representatives of Sidley Austin reviewed with the Board their fiduciary duties in considering the proposed
transaction agreements. Representatives of Sidley Austin then reviewed with the Board the final terms of the proposed revised CLUB
transaction documents and the proposed amendment to the merger agreement. The Sidley Austin representatives then discussed with
the Board the status of the FTC antitrust review and the bank regulatory approval process, reviewing both the potential timing to obtain
potential approval and the potential likelihood of approval based on the information as they understood it. Also at this meeting,
Guggenheim Securities reviewed its financial analysis of the $61.50 per share merger consideration with the Board and rendered an
oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written

opinion dated April 17, 2017, to the Board to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters considered, the
procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken, the $61.50 per share
merger consideration to be received in the merger by holders of Company common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders. Management then discussed with the Board a number of considerations related to the revised proposed transaction.
Following those discussions, management indicated it was management’s recommendation that the Board approve the revised CLUB
transaction agreements and the amendment to the merger agreement. Following discussion, the Board unanimously approved the
revised CLUB transaction agreements and the amendment to the merger agreement.

Following the closing of trading on the NYSE on April 17, 2017, CONA, its applicable affiliates, Synovus, the Company
and WFB entered into the applicable revised CLUB transaction agreements, the Company and an affiliate of CONA entered into the
amendment to the program agreement and the Company, Parent and Merger Sub entered into the amendment to the merger agreement.

Also on April 17, 2017, Parent, with the consent of the Company, entered into a timing agreement with the FTC, pursuant to
which Parent agreed, among other things, not to complete the merger until at least 75 days after both the Company and Parent certified
substantial compliance with the FTC’s request for additional information and documentary material relating to the merger issued on
December 29, 2016, unless the FTC notifies the Company and Parent that it has closed its review sooner. The Company so certified
substantial compliance on April 3, 2017 and Parent so certified substantial compliance on April 14, 2017.

•  directed that a proposal to adopt the merger agreement (as modified by the merger agreement amendment) be

submitted to a vote at a meeting of Company stockholders; and
 

 
•  recommended that Company stockholders vote for the adoption of the merger agreement (as modified by the merger

agreement amendment).

Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement

In evaluating the merger agreement (as modified by the merger agreement amendment) and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger, the Board consulted with the Company’s senior management team and outside legal and financial
advisors and, in reaching its decision to recommend that the Company stockholders approve the merger agreement, considered and
evaluated numerous factors over the course of the meetings of the Board since the Company announced commencement of its strategic
review process on December 2, 2015, including the following material factors, each of which the Board believes supported its
determinations:
 

 

•  Challenges the Company Faces as an Independent Company; Strategic Alternatives. The Board considered the
possibility of continuing to operate the Company as an independent public company, including the related risks and
uncertainties and the prospects for the Company going forward as an independent entity. In doing so, the Board
considered the following:

 

 

•  the current and historical financial condition, results of operations and business of the Company and the
Company’s historical performance relative to other companies in the sector, the risks associated with
achieving and executing upon the Company’s financial plan and the other risks disclosed under “Risk
Factors” in the Company’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K;

 

 

•  the strategic plan developed by the Company’s senior management and the uncertainty regarding whether
the Company would be able to execute the strategic plan and achieve the results contemplated by the plan,
including in light of the fact that the strategic plan does not contemplate an economic recession, the
Company’s financial performance to date and the other factors identified herein, and that the Company’s
recent performance had fallen short of previous strategic plans;

 

 
•  overall sector conditions and changes in the nature of the retail business, including: increasing competition

in the sector, reduced apparel spending, and challenges posed by the continuing shift of sales from
brick-and-mortar stores to the internet, as well as overall conditions in the financial services sector;

 

 
•  the Company’s succession planning initiatives, including difficulties experienced by the Company in

recruitment and retention of senior management and other key personnel;
 

 
•  the episodic increases in Company sales of firearms and ammunition that have occurred at various points

in the recent past, often due to political change or exogenous events, and the prospect that such increases
may not recur, including as a result of the results of recent U.S. elections;

 

 •  the U.S. political, judicial and regulatory climate relating to the sale, ownership and use of firearms;
 

 
•  the current state of the economy and uncertainty surrounding projected macroeconomic and consumer

sentiment conditions both in the near term and the long term; and
 

 
•  in light of the foregoing, the Company’s near-term and longer-term prospects as an independent standalone

company.

The Board further considered that the original merger agreement was the result of a strategic review process it had
undertaken with the assistance of Guggenheim Securities, which included the following:
 

 

•  a review of other strategic alternatives, including the possibility of continuing to operate the Company
under various alternative standalone plans (which could include an acquisition strategy, a leveraged
recapitalization and/or a real estate monetization transaction) and a sale, divesture or bank partnership
transaction of the financial services business as a separate transaction or in connection with the sale of the
Company;

 

 

•  a consideration of attempting to sell the Company to a third party without simultaneously selling the
financial services business, and the Board’s conclusion—based on the Company’s own analysis and on
conversations with its advisors and bank regulators—that it was highly unlikely that the applicable bank
regulators would approve a sale of the Company in which the Company did not simultaneously dispose of
the deposits of its banking subsidiary to a financial institution; and therefore the need to undertake a
transaction involving the financial services business in connection with the sale of the Company;

 

 
•  a review of the potential for a sale of the financial services business and an accompanying partnership with

a financial institution for the issuance of Company-branded credit cards, which the Board concluded was
not preferable to the merger;

 

 
•  the potential negative impact on the Company’s retail business should the Company determine to sell the

financial services business and enter into an accompanying partnership with a financial institution and
remain as a standalone retail business;

 

 
•  a review of the range of possible benefits to the Company’s stockholders of the various strategic

alternatives and the timing and the costs, risks and likelihood of accomplishing the goals of any of these
alternatives; and

 

 
•  an assessment by the Board that none of the above-described strategic alternatives was reasonably likely to

present superior opportunities for the Company, or reasonably likely to create greater value for the
Company’s stockholders, than the merger.

 

 •  Transaction Consideration.

That the merger consideration of $61.50 represented:
 

 

•  a 12.0% premium over the closing price of shares of Company common stock reported for September 30,
2016, the last trading day before the approval of the original merger agreement by the Board, a 15.2%
premium over the closing price of shares of Company common stock reported for April 13, 2017, the last
trading day before the approval of the merger agreement amendment by the Board and a 33.0% premium
to the closing price of shares of the Company’s common stock reported for March 28, 2017, the last
trading day before certain reports of a revised bank transaction with Capital One and Synovus appeared in
the news media;

 

 
•  a 25.4% premium over the closing price of shares of Company common stock reported for August 30,

2016, the trading date one month prior to the last trading day before the approval of the original merger
agreement by the Board;

 

 
•  a premium of 31.1% over the closing price of shares of Company common stock reported for December 1,

2015, such date being the last trading day before the Company announced that the Board of Directors was
exploring strategic alternatives for the Company; and

 

 
•  a 84.0% premium over the closing price of shares of Company common stock reported for October 27,

2015, the last trading day before the filing by significant stockholders of

the corporation of a Schedule 13D with the SEC, in which such stockholders disclosed their investment in
the Company and stated their intention to communicate with the Company’s Board of Directors regarding
strategic alternatives for the Company.

 

 

•  Strategic Review and Broad and Competitive Process. As part of the Board’s exploration of strategic alternatives,
which was publicly disclosed and which culminated with the Board approval of and the Company’s entry into the
original merger agreement, the Company and, on behalf of the Company, its financial advisor had contact with a wide
variety of potential parties interested in an acquisition of the Company, 15 of which executed confidentiality
agreements and received confidential information regarding the Company, and contact with a variety of potential
parties interested in an acquisition of all or a portion of the financial services business, 12 of which executed
confidentiality agreements and received confidential information regarding the financial services business. The Board
also considered that the three finalists submitting second round bids in respect of an acquisition of the Company had
been afforded the opportunity to review detailed bids submitted by parties interested in an acquisition of the financial
services business and to select from among those bids one or more financial institutions as prospective partners for a
transaction involving the financial services business; and that following that selection, two of the three finalists
expressing an interest in an acquisition of the Company had had competitive discussions with those financial
institutions and were permitted to take the lead in structuring and negotiating terms to help inform their overall
assessment of the valuation for the whole Company. The Board also considered that the merger consideration
provided under the original merger agreement was a result of a competitive process which yielded a price per share
above the high end of the range of the three second round bids, $2.50 per share above Parent’s second round bid and,
following negotiations with Parent’s financial advisor, $0.50 per share above Parent’s bid submitted on September 28,
2016. The Board further considered that at the time of the entry into the original merger agreement (i) the
consideration provided under the original merger agreement was $1.50 to $2.50 per share higher than Private Equity
Firm F’s indication of a potential price per share range, (ii) between the time Private Equity Firm F submitted its last
proposal in July of 2016 and the entry into the original merger agreement, Private Equity Firm F had made several
statements to Guggenheim Securities regarding its concerns that the Company’s performance and due diligence
matters would adversely impact Private Equity Firm F’s valuation of the Company, (iii) Private Equity Firm F did not
submit a bid by the September 28, 2016 deadline prior to the entry into the original merger agreement, (iv) Private
Equity Firm F had informed Guggenheim Securities prior to the entry into the original merger agreement that it had
not yet been able to arrange financing commitments for the real estate portion of its financing and (v) while Private
Equity Firm F indicated at that time it was still working to submit a final bid, it had not committed to a definitive date
by which it would submit a final bid and there was no assurance that if Private Equity Firm F were to submit a final
bid it would be more favorable than Parent’s bid and based on the foregoing and the broad and competitive process
engaged in by the Company, the Board’s belief prior to the entry into the original merger agreement that it was
unlikely that any other financial sponsors or strategic buyers would be willing to acquire the Company at a price in
excess of the consideration provided under the original merger agreement. In evaluating the merger agreement
amendment, the Board further considered that the original merger agreement provided that potentially interested
parties were able to submit a competing proposal in a timely manner, if they so desired, but that since the
announcement of the original merger agreement, the Company had not received any competing proposal to the merger
from a third party. The Board also considered the likelihood that any other potentially interested parties would be able
to submit a competing proposal in a timely manner, if they so desired, following the announcement of the execution
of the merger agreement amendment.

 

 
•  Effect of the Merger Agreement Amendment. In approving the merger agreement amendment and re-affirming its

approval of the merger, the Board particularly considered the matters and developments following the entry into the
original merger agreement described above under “-

Background of the Merger,” including the performance of the Company since the announcement of the original
merger agreement and statements by CONA to the Company that while Capital One expected that the transactions
under the original bank purchase agreement would be approved by the OCC, Capital One did not expect that such
approval would occur prior to October 3, 2017, the date after which any of Parent, the Company or CONA would
have the right to terminate the merger agreement or the original bank purchase agreement, as applicable. In that
regard, the Board considered the prospective risks and benefits of initiating legal proceedings against CONA in
connection with the original bank purchase agreement, including an action to seek termination of the original bank
purchase agreement in order to pursue an alternative transaction relating to the financial services business and/or an
action to recover damages from CONA. The Board also considered its view that the merger agreement and the bank
framework agreement with Capital One and Synovus presented the best opportunity for the Company to consummate
a transaction on a similar time frame as that contemplated at the signing of the original merger agreement that
preserved substantially all of the merger consideration provided by the original merger agreement.

In that regard, the Board further considered the following:
 

 
•  the Board’s belief that CONA would not be able to obtain the applicable regulatory approvals to

consummate the transaction under the original bank purchase agreement prior to the October 3, 2017
outside date provided under the original merger agreement;

 

 

•  that although the original merger agreement provided for Parent to use reasonable best efforts to seek
alternative transactions for the financial services business in the event that the original bank purchase
agreement was terminated, the original merger agreement provided that Parent was not obligated to agree
to the Company’s entry into such a transaction if it was materially less favorable to the Company (or from
and after the effective time, Parent or the surviving corporation) than the transaction contemplated by the
original bank purchase agreement (terms which continue to apply to the bank framework agreement
involving Synovus and Capital One);

 

 
•  the negative consequences to Parent of the amendment to the credit card program agreement sought by

Capital One as part of the restructured transaction and of delays in the closing;
 

 

•  that as described above, the original transaction with CONA had been selected by Parent following its
review of a variety of other proposals for the financial services business, which proposals were the product
of a broad and competitive process, and therefore the prospect that an alternative transaction with another
purchaser of the financial services business, if any such transaction were available, would be materially
less favorable than the original transaction with CONA;

 

 

•  the prospect that Parent would seek to renegotiate the merger consideration payable under the original
merger agreement if it were asked to consent to an alternative transaction for the financial services
business not including Capital One or if the October 3, 2017 outside date under the merger agreement were
reached;

 

 
•  that the termination fee payable by Parent to the Company in certain circumstances involving the failure of

antitrust approval for the merger to be obtained generally would not apply if regulatory approvals for the
bank transaction were not obtained;

 

 
•  uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation by the Company and WFB against CONA and the expense

of such litigation;
 

 
•  the prospect that even if the Company were successful in terminating the original bank purchase agreement

through litigation, there would likely not be sufficient time remaining before the October 3, 2017 outside
date provided under the original merger

agreement for a transaction with another purchaser of the financial services business to be documented and
for regulatory approval of such a transaction to be obtained;

 

 
•  the possibility that other potential purchasers of the financial services business may also be unable to

obtain regulatory approvals for such a transaction before the October 3, 2017 outside date; and
 

 

•  that (i) the seeking of damages against CONA by the Company and WFB for potential claims the
Company might have under the original bank purchase agreement would likely be a lengthy process,
(ii) the ability of the Company and WFB to potentially recover damages from CONA under the original
bank purchase agreement would be limited following a termination of that agreement and (iii) if the
closing of the merger occurs, any damages recovered from CONA would not inure to the benefit of those
persons who had been stockholders of the Company prior to the closing of the merger in light of the fixed
all-cash nature of the merger consideration under the merger agreement.

 

 

•  Lengthy and Publicly Announced Nature of Exploration of Strategic Alternatives. The Company publicly
announced on December 2, 2015 that the Board was initiating a process to explore and evaluate a wide range of
strategic alternatives to further enhance shareholder value, thereby affording any interested party the opportunity to
make a proposal for a transaction with the Company. As noted above, during the approximately ten months between
that announcement and the entry into the original merger agreement, the Company, with the assistance of its financial
advisor, engaged and had discussions with a wide variety of interested parties.

 

 

•  Cash Consideration; Certainty of Value. The fact that the merger consideration payable at the closing of the merger
is a fixed cash amount, providing the Company’s stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon
the closing of the transaction, in comparison to the risks and uncertainty that would be inherent in remaining a stand-
alone company.

 

 

•  Financial Analyses; Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor. The financial presentation and the opinion,
dated April 17, 2017, of Guggenheim Securities to the Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as
of the date of the opinion, of the $61.50 per share merger consideration to be received in the merger by holders of
Company common stock, which opinion was based on and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed,
the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken as more fully described
under the section entitled “— Opinion of Our Financial Advisor,” beginning on page 71.

 

 

•  No Financing Condition; Remedies. The merger is not subject to a financing condition and, in particular, that Parent
has obtained committed debt financing for the transaction from reputable financial institutions and committed
preferred equity financing and has funded certain of that debt financing into escrow; the limited number and nature of
the conditions to the debt and preferred equity financing and the obligation of Parent to use reasonable best efforts to
consummate the debt financing; and the Company’s ability, under circumstances specified in the merger agreement, to
specifically enforce Parent’s obligation to enforce the financing commitments and to cause the preferred equity
financing sources to fund their contributions as contemplated by the merger agreement and the equity commitment
letters. The Board also considered the requirement that, in the event of a failure of the merger to be consummated
under specified circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the failure of debt or preferred equity financing
sources to provide funds at closing, Parent will pay the Company a termination fee of $230,000,000, or approximately
5.3% of the equity value of the merger (for purposes of this section entitled “Reasons for Recommending the
Adoption of the Merger Agreement”, unless set forth otherwise, references to the equity value of the merger assumes
that the merger consideration is $61.50 per share).

Table of Contents

 

•  Likelihood of Consummation. The conditions to the consummation of the merger and the likelihood of closing and
the fact that no third-party (non-governmental) consents are conditions to the consummation of the merger. The Board
also considered that Parent is required to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals, and the requirement
that, in the event of a failure of the merger to be consummated under specified circumstances related to the failure to
obtain antitrust law approvals, Parent will pay the Company a termination fee of $230,000,000, or approximately
5.3% of the equity value of the merger, and that in the event that Parent willfully and materially breaches its
obligations relating to the seeking of antitrust law clearances for the merger, in addition to the receipt of such
termination fee, the Company would have the ability to pursue one or more claims for damages against Parent in an
aggregate amount not to exceed $115,000,000, or a further approximately 2.7% of the equity value of the merger.

 

 

•  Availability of Appraisal Rights. The availability of appraisal rights under the DGCL to Company stockholders who
do not vote in favor of the merger and who otherwise comply with all of the required procedures under the DGCL,
which provides those eligible stockholders with an opportunity to have the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Court
of Chancery”) determine the fair value of their shares of Company common stock, which may be more than, less than
or the same as the amount such stockholders would have received under the merger agreement.

 

 
•  Terms of the merger agreement. The general terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the course of

negotiations of the key provisions thereof, including:
 

 •  the parties’ representations, warranties and covenants;
 

 

•  the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations
with a third party, if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that the third party has made an unsolicited competing proposal that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal and that the failure to take such
actions would reasonably be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders
under applicable law;

 

 

•  the fact that, in certain circumstances, the Board is permitted to change its recommendation that the
Company’s stockholders vote in favor of the merger, which would result in Parent having the right to
terminate the merger agreement at which time the Company would be required to pay Parent a termination
fee of $126,000,000, or approximately 2.9% of the equity value of the merger, and pay Capital One a
termination fee of $14,000,000, or approximately 0.3% of the equity value of the merger; and

 

 
•  the Board’s belief that the terms of the merger agreement were reasonable and would not discourage other

potential acquirors from making an alternative proposal to acquire the Company.
 

 •  Potentially negative factors, including:
 

 

•  the fact that the merger agreement precludes the Company from actively soliciting alternative proposals,
which the Board believed was mitigated by the fact that: (i) the Company had conducted an open and
competitive sale process, (ii) the Board’s belief that, as noted above, the terms of the merger agreement
were reasonable and would not preclude other potential acquirors from making an alternative proposal to
acquire the Company and (iii) the Board’s belief that no potential acquiror of the Company other than
Parent would be willing to pay more than the merger consideration;

 

 
•  the possibility that the Company’s obligation to pay Parent a termination fee of $126,000,000, or

approximately 2.9% of the equity value of the merger, and Capital One

a termination fee of $14,000,000, or approximately 0.3% of the equity value of the merger, if the merger
agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving a superior proposal, as well as Parent’s
rights to match any such proposal, could discourage other potential acquirers from making an alternative
proposal to acquire the Company;

 

 

•  the fact that, following the merger, the Company will no longer exist as an independent public company
and the Company’s existing stockholders will not participate in the future earnings or growth of the
Company or Parent or benefit from any synergies resulting from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement;

 

 
•  the restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the consummation of the merger, which

may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking certain business opportunities that may arise;
 

 
•  the potential negative effect of the pendency of the merger on the Company’s business prior to its

completion, including disruptions to customers, suppliers and employees;
 

 

•  the possibility that the merger may not be completed for regulatory, financing or other reasons and the
potential adverse consequences to the Company if the transactions are not completed, including the
potential impact on the Company’s stock price, the potential loss of customers, suppliers and employees,
and the potential erosion of third-party confidence in the Company;

 

 

•  the possibility that the bank framework agreement could be terminated by Synovus or Capital One or the
credit card program agreement could be terminated by Capital One prior to the closing of the merger due to
failure to obtain regulatory consents or due to other factors (including an MAE in respect of WFB or
failure to obtain rating agency consents to transfer certain securitization assets);

 

 
•  the fact that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the merger consideration will be taxable to Company

stockholders who are entitled to receive such consideration;
 

 
•  the significant costs involved in connection with entering into and completing the merger and the

substantial time and effort of management required to complete the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, which may disrupt the Company’s business operations; and

 

 
•  the fact that the Company’s directors and executive officers may receive certain benefits that are different

from, or in addition to, those of Company stockholders (such as change in control or termination
payments).

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but
includes the material factors considered by the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise
assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual
directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to
whether, or to what extent, any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination.
The Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented, including the factors described above.

Opinion of Our Financial Advisor

Overview

The Company retained Guggenheim Securities as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. In selecting
Guggenheim Securities as its financial advisor, the Company considered that, among other things, Guggenheim Securities is an
internationally recognized investment banking, financial advisory and securities firm whose senior professionals have substantial
experience advising companies in, among other industries, the retail industry. Guggenheim Securities, as part of its investment banking,
financial advisory and capital markets businesses, is regularly engaged in the valuation and financial assessment of businesses and
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, recapitalizations, spin-offs/split-offs, restructurings, securities offerings in both
the private and public capital markets and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

At the April 17, 2017 meeting of the Board held to evaluate and approve the merger and the entry into the merger agreement
amendment by the Company, Guggenheim Securities rendered an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion,
dated April 17, 2017, to the Board to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters considered, the procedures
followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken, the merger consideration to be
received in the merger by holders of Company common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For purposes of
Guggenheim Securities’ analyses and opinion, the term “merger consideration” refers to the $61.50 per share merger consideration.

This description of Guggenheim Securities’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the written opinion, which is
attached as Annex E to this proxy statement and which you should read carefully and in its entirety. Guggenheim Securities’ written
opinion sets forth the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications
to the review undertaken by Guggenheim Securities. Guggenheim Securities’ written opinion, which was authorized for issuance by
the Fairness Opinion and Valuation Committee of Guggenheim Securities, is necessarily based on economic, capital markets and other
conditions, and the information made available to Guggenheim Securities, as of the date of such opinion. Guggenheim Securities has
no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on facts, circumstances or events occurring after the date of the rendering of
the opinion.

In reading the discussion of Guggenheim Securities’ opinion set forth below, you should be aware that such opinion (and, as
applicable, any materials provided in connection therewith):
 

 
•  was provided to the Board (in its capacity as such) for its information and assistance in connection with its evaluation

of the merger consideration;
 

 •  did not constitute a recommendation to the Board with respect to the merger or any related transactions;
 

 
•  does not constitute advice or a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the

merger, any related transactions or otherwise;
 

 

•  did not address the underlying business or financial decision of the Company to pursue the merger and related
transactions, the relative merits of the merger or any related transactions as compared to any alternative business or
financial strategies that might exist for the Company, the financing of the merger or the effects of any other
transaction in which the Company might engage;

 

 

•  addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of such opinion, of the merger
consideration to the extent expressly specified in such opinion without regard to individual circumstances of specific
holders of, or any rights, preferences, restrictions or limitations that may be attributable to, shares of Company
common stock or other securities of the Company;

 

 •  did not address proportionate allocation or relative fairness among holders of Company common stock or otherwise;

•  expressed no view or opinion as to (i) any other term, aspect or implication of the merger or any related transactions
or the merger agreement or any related agreements, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger,
any adjustments to the merger consideration, the form or structure, or financial or other terms of, any related
transactions, any terms, aspects or implications of any related agreements or voting or other agreement, transaction
document or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or to be entered into or amended in connection with
the merger or any related transactions, or (ii) the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the merger or any related
transactions to, or of any consideration to be paid to or received by, the holders of any class of securities, creditors or
other constituencies of the Company, Parent or other participants in the merger or any related transactions; and

 

 

•  expressed no view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation
payable to or to be received by the directors, officers or employees of any of the Company, Parent or other
participants in the merger or any related transactions, or any class of such persons, in connection with the merger or
any related transactions relative to the merger consideration or otherwise.

In the course of performing its reviews and analyses for rendering its opinion, Guggenheim Securities:
 

 
•  reviewed the original merger agreement and a draft, provided to Guggenheim Securities on April 14, 2017, of the

merger agreement amendment;
 

 •  reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information regarding the Company;
 

 

•  reviewed certain non-public business and financial information regarding the businesses and prospects of the
Company, including certain financial projections for the Company for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 (which we refer
to in this section as the “Company forecast”), all as prepared and provided to Guggenheim Securities by the senior
management of the Company;

 

 
•  discussed with the senior management of the Company its strategic and financial rationale for the merger and related

transactions as well as its views of the businesses, operations, historical, current and projected financial results and
future prospects of the Company and evolving industry dynamics related to the Company;

 

 •  reviewed the historical prices, trading multiples and trading activity of the shares of Company common stock;
 

 
•  compared the financial performance of the Company and the trading multiples of the shares of Company common

stock with corresponding data for certain other publicly traded companies that Guggenheim Securities deemed
relevant in evaluating the Company;

 

 
•  reviewed the valuation and financial metrics of certain mergers and acquisitions that Guggenheim Securities deemed

relevant in evaluating the merger;
 

 •  performed a discounted cash flow analysis for the Company based on the Company forecast; and
 

 •  conducted such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as Guggenheim Securities deemed appropriate.

As the Board was aware, Guggenheim Securities previously rendered an opinion, dated as of October 2, 2016 (which we
refer to as the “original opinion”), as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration contemplated by the
original merger agreement. The original opinion was based on, among other things, various financial analyses that were predicated on
certain financial projections for the Company for the fiscal years 2016 through 2020 (which we refer to in this section as the “original
Company forecast”). Guggenheim Securities was advised by the Board and senior management of the Company that the original
Company forecast was superseded in its entirety by the Company forecast and, accordingly, Guggenheim Securities was directed by the
Board and senior management of the Company to rely exclusively on the Company forecast for purposes of Guggenheim Securities’
analyses and opinion.

Table of Contents

With respect to the information used in arriving at its opinion, Guggenheim Securities notes that:
 

 

•  Guggenheim Securities relied upon and assumed the accuracy, completeness and reasonableness of all industry,
business, financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, actuarial and other information (including, without limitation,
the Company forecast and any other estimates and other forward-looking information) furnished by or discussed with
the Company or obtained from public sources, data suppliers and other third parties.

 

 

•  Guggenheim Securities (i) did not assume any responsibility, obligation or liability for the accuracy, completeness,
reasonableness, achievability or independent verification of, and Guggenheim Securities did not independently verify,
any such information (including, without limitation, the Company forecast or any other estimates and other forward-
looking information), (ii) expressed no view, opinion, representation, guaranty or warranty (in each case, express or
implied) regarding the reasonableness or achievability of the Company forecast and any other estimates and other
forward-looking information or the assumptions upon which they are based and (iii) relied upon the assurances of the
senior management of the Company that it was unaware of any facts or circumstances that would make such
information (including, without limitation, the Company forecast and any other estimates and other forward-looking
information) incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.

 

 

•  Specifically, with respect to (i) the Company forecast and any other estimates and other forward-looking information
relating to the Company furnished by or discussed with the Company, (A) Guggenheim Securities was advised by the
senior management of the Company, and Guggenheim Securities assumed, that the Company forecast and such other
estimates and other forward-looking information utilized in its analyses had been reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best then-currently available estimates and judgments of the senior management of the Company as to
the expected future performance of the Company and the corporate income tax rates applicable to the Company
forecast and such other estimates and other forward-looking information and (B) Guggenheim Securities assumed that
the Company forecast and such other estimates and other forward-looking information had been reviewed by the
Board with the understanding that such information would be used and relied upon by Guggenheim Securities in
connection with rendering its opinion and (ii) financial projections, other estimates and/or other forward-looking
information obtained by Guggenheim Securities from public sources, data suppliers and other third parties,
Guggenheim Securities assumed that such information was reasonable and reliable.

Guggenheim Securities also noted certain other considerations with respect to its engagement and the rendering of its
opinion:
 

 
•  Prior to the Company entering into the original merger agreement, Guggenheim Securities was asked by the Board to

solicit indications of interest from various third parties regarding a potential transaction with the Company, and
Guggenheim Securities considered the results of such solicitation in rendering its opinion.

 

 
•  Guggenheim Securities did not perform or obtain any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including any

contingent, derivative or off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any other entity or the solvency or
fair value of the Company or any other entity, nor was Guggenheim Securities furnished with any such appraisals.

 

 

•  Guggenheim Securities’ professionals are not legal, regulatory, tax, consulting, accounting, appraisal or actuarial
experts and nothing in Guggenheim Securities’ opinion should be construed as constituting advice with respect to
such matters; accordingly, Guggenheim Securities relied on the assessments of the Company and its other advisors
with respect to such matters. The senior management of the Company advised Guggenheim Securities that all
tax-affected financial projections (including, without limitation, the Company forecast), other estimates and other

forward-looking information reflect the current US federal corporate income tax regime pursuant to the code; at the
direction of the senior management of the Company, Guggenheim Securities did not consider or analyze the impacts
of any potential or proposed reform thereof in connection with its opinion and analyses. Guggenheim Securities did
not express any view or render any opinion regarding the tax consequences of the merger or any related transactions
to the Company or its securityholders.

 

 •  Guggenheim Securities further assumed that:
 

 

•  in all respects meaningful to its analyses, (i) the final executed form of the merger agreement amendment
would not differ from the draft that Guggenheim Securities reviewed, (ii) the Company, Parent and Sub
and the other participants in the merger and related transactions would comply with all material terms of
the merger agreement and related agreements and (iii) the representations and warranties of the Company,
Parent and Sub and the other participants in the merger and related transactions contained in the merger
agreement and related agreements were true and correct in all material respects and all conditions to the
obligations of each party to the merger agreement and related agreements to consummate the merger and
related transactions would be satisfied without any waiver, modification or amendment thereof; and

 

 

•  the merger and related transactions, as applicable, would be consummated in a timely manner and in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements and in compliance with all
applicable laws, documents and other requirements, without any delays, limitations, restrictions,
conditions, waivers, amendments or modifications (regulatory, tax-related or otherwise), including any
divestiture or other requirements, that would have an effect on the Company, the merger or related
transactions in any way meaningful to Guggenheim Securities’ analyses or opinion.

 

 
•  Guggenheim Securities did not express any view or opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the shares of

Company common stock or other securities of the Company may trade or otherwise be transferable at any time,
including subsequent to the announcement or consummation of the merger.

Summary of Financial Analyses

Overview of Financial Analyses

This “Summary of Financial Analyses” presents a summary of the principal financial analyses performed by Guggenheim
Securities and presented to the Board in connection with Guggenheim Securities’ rendering of its opinion. Such presentation to the
Board was supplemented by Guggenheim Securities’ oral discussion with the Board, the nature and substance of which may not be
fully described herein.

Some of the financial analyses summarized below include summary data and information presented in tabular format. In
order to understand fully such financial analyses, the summary data and tables must be read together with the full text of the summary.
Considering the summary data and tables alone could create a misleading or incomplete view of Guggenheim Securities’ financial
analyses.

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various judgments and determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances involved. A fairness
opinion therefore is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description, and taking portions of the financial analyses set
forth below, without considering such analyses as a whole, would in Guggenheim Securities’ view create an incomplete and misleading
picture of the processes underlying the financial analyses considered in rendering Guggenheim Securities’ opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, Guggenheim Securities:
 

 
•  based its financial analyses on various assumptions, including assumptions concerning general business and economic

conditions, capital markets considerations and industry-specific and company-specific factors, all of which are beyond
the control of the Company, Parent and Guggenheim Securities;

 

 
•  did not form a view or opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor, whether positive or negative,

considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion;
 

 
•  considered the results of all of its financial analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any one analysis or

factor; and
 

 

•  ultimately arrived at its opinion based on the results of all of its financial analyses assessed as a whole and believes
that the totality of the factors considered and the various financial analyses performed by Guggenheim Securities in
connection with its opinion operated collectively to support its determination as to the fairness, from a financial point
of view and as of the date of its opinion, of the merger consideration to the extent expressly specified in such opinion.

With respect to the financial analyses performed by Guggenheim Securities in connection with rendering its opinion:
 

 
•  Such financial analyses, particularly those based on estimates and projections, are not necessarily indicative of actual

values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.
 

 

•  None of the selected publicly traded companies used in the selected public companies analysis described below is
identical or directly comparable to the Company, and none of the selected precedent merger and acquisition
transactions used in the selected precedent transactions analysis described below is identical or directly comparable to
the merger; however, such companies and transactions were selected by Guggenheim Securities, among other reasons,
because they represented or involved target companies which may be considered broadly similar, for purposes of
Guggenheim Securities’ financial analyses, to the Company based on Guggenheim Securities’ familiarity with each
such company in addition to the retail industry.

 

 

•  In any event, the selected public companies analysis and the selected precedent transactions analysis are not
mathematical; rather, such analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning the differences in
business, financial, operating and capital markets-related characteristics and other sector and market factors regarding
the selected publicly traded companies and selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions to which the
Company and the merger were compared.

 

 
•  Such financial analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which any securities may trade at the

present time or at any time in the future.

Financial Analyses

Recap of Financial Analyses. In evaluating the Company in connection with rendering its opinion, Guggenheim Securities
performed various financial analyses which are summarized in the table below and described in more detail elsewhere herein, including
a discounted cash flow analysis, a selected precedent transactions analysis and a selected public companies analysis. Solely for
informational reference purposes, Guggenheim Securities also reviewed the historical intraday trading price range for Company
common stock and Wall Street equity research analysts’ price targets for Company common stock. Implied per share equity values
(other than historical trading price ranges) reflected below were rounded to the nearest $0.25.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Guggenheim Securities performed an illustrative standalone discounted cash flow analysis
of the Company based on forecasted unlevered free cash flows for the Company and an estimate of its terminal/continuing value at the
end of the forecast horizon derived from the Company forecast. In performing its illustrative discounted cash flow analysis:
 

 
•  Guggenheim Securities utilized a selected discount rate range of 8.25% to 10.25% based on an estimate of the

Company’s weighted average cost of capital.
 

 
•  In calculating the terminal/continuing value for the Company for purposes of its discounted cash flow analysis,

Guggenheim Securities utilized an illustrative reference range of perpetuity growth rates of the Company’s terminal
year normalized after-tax unlevered free cash flow of 1.75% to 2.25%.

Guggenheim Securities’ illustrative discounted cash flow analysis resulted in an overall reference range of approximately
$40.75 to $61.25 per share for purposes of evaluating Company common stock on a standalone intrinsic-value basis, as compared to
the merger consideration of $61.50 per share of Company common stock.

Guggenheim Securities calculated, among other things and to the extent publicly available, certain implied
change-of-control transaction multiples for the selected precedent transactions (based on then-available Wall Street equity research
estimates, each company’s most recent publicly available financial filings and other publicly available information), which are
summarized in the table below:

In performing its selected precedent transactions analysis of the Company, Guggenheim Securities selected a reference range
of transaction enterprise value/LTM EBITDA multiples of 8.0x to 11.0x for purposes of evaluating the Company on a
change-of-control basis, which implied an overall reference range of approximately $44.50 to $64.25 per share of Company common
stock, as compared to the merger consideration of $61.50 per share of Company common stock. Guggenheim Securities noted that such
overall reference range implied a reference range of transaction enterprise value/NTM EBITDA multiples of approximately 6.9x to
9.5x.

Selected Public Companies Analysis. Guggenheim Securities reviewed and analyzed trading metrics and historical and
forecasted financial performance of the Company compared to corresponding data for selected publicly traded companies with
operations in the retail industry that Guggenheim Securities in its professional judgment deemed relevant for purposes of this analysis.
The following 13 publicly traded companies, consisting of eight publicly traded mature large-box specialty retailers with high brand
recognition and well-penetrated business models, generally with lower potential long-term EPS growth outlooks given their limited
store growth opportunities (which we refer to as the “selected well-penetrated companies”), and five publicly traded specialty retailers
with higher potential unit growth and new market potential, generally with higher potential long-term EPS growth outlooks (which we
refer to as the “selected higher growth companies” and, together with the selected well-penetrated companies, collectively, the
“selected companies”), were selected by Guggenheim Securities for purposes of this analysis:

In performing its selected public companies analysis of the Company, Guggenheim Securities selected reference ranges of
trading multiples for purposes of evaluating the Company on a standalone public market trading basis as follows: (i) an enterprise
value/2017E EBITDA multiple range of 6.0x to 8.0x, which implied an overall reference range of approximately $37.50 to $53.00 per
share of Company common stock, and (ii) a stock price/2017E EPS multiple range of 13.0x to 17.0x, which implied an overall
reference range of approximately $43.75 to $57.00 per share of Company common stock, in each case as compared to the merger
consideration of $61.50 per share of Company common stock. Guggenheim Securities noted that such overall reference ranges implied
reference ranges of enterprise value/2016A EBITDA and stock price/2016A EPS multiples of approximately 7.0x to 9.3x and 16.8x to
21.9x, respectively.

Other Financial Reviews Solely for Informational Reference Purposes

In order to provide certain context for the financial analyses in connection with its opinion as described above, Guggenheim
Securities undertook various additional financial reviews as summarized below solely for informational reference purposes. As a
general matter, Guggenheim Securities does not consider such additional financial reviews to be determinative methodologies for
purposes of its opinion.

Stock Price Trading History. Guggenheim Securities reviewed the stock price trading history for the Company over the
52-week period ended September 30, 2016 and from October 3, 2016 to April 13, 2017. Guggenheim Securities noted that the range of
stock prices for the Company during such periods was approximately $33.03 to $55.07 per share and $45.00 to 64.60 per share,
respectively, as compared to the merger consideration of $61.50 per share of Company common stock.

Wall Street Equity Research Analysts’ Discounted Stock Price Targets. Guggenheim Securities reviewed selected Wall Street
equity research analysts’ price targets for Company common stock as published by certain Wall Street equity research analysts.
 

 
•  Guggenheim Securities noted that, based on such equity research analysts’ price targets as of September 30, 2016, the

range of selected Wall Street equity research analysts’ 12-month forward

Table of Contents

 
price targets for Company common stock was approximately $35.75 to $55.75 per share on a present value basis (as
of April 13, 2017) using an illustrative discount rate of 10.5% based on the Company’s cost of equity, as compared to
the merger consideration of $61.50 per share of Company common stock.

 

 

•  Guggenheim Securities also noted that, based on such equity research analysts’ price targets in the event the merger
does not close, the range of selected Wall Street equity research analysts’ price targets for Company common stock
was approximately $38.00 to $47.00 per share, as compared to the merger consideration of $61.50 per share of
Company common stock.

 

 

•  Guggenheim Securities further noted that the public market trading price targets published by Wall Street equity
research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for shares of Company common stock, and
such estimates are subject to various uncertainties, including the future financial performance of the Company and
future capital markets conditions.

Other Considerations

Except as described in the summary above, the Company did not provide specific instructions to, or place any limitations
on, Guggenheim Securities with respect to the procedures to be followed or factors to be considered in performing its financial
analyses or providing its opinion. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger and related transactions were
determined through negotiations among the Company, Parent and Capital One, as applicable, and were approved by the Board. The
decision to enter into the merger agreement and related transactions was solely that of the Board. Guggenheim Securities’ opinion was
just one of the many factors taken into consideration by the Board. Consequently, Guggenheim Securities’ financial analyses should
not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the Board with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of
Company common stock of the merger consideration to be received in the merger.

Pursuant to the terms of Guggenheim Securities’ engagement, the Company has agreed to pay Guggenheim Securities
aggregate cash fees (based on a percentage of the aggregate value of the merger consideration) currently estimated to be approximately
$37,000,000, of which $250,000 was payable as a retainer, $2,000,000 became payable as a milestone fee upon delivery of the original
opinion and the remaining approximately $34,750,000 is payable upon consummation of the merger. In addition, the Company has
agreed to reimburse Guggenheim Securities for certain expenses and to indemnify it against certain liabilities arising out of its
engagement.

As the Board was aware, aside from Guggenheim Securities’ current engagement as the Company’s financial advisor, during
the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, Guggenheim Securities had not previously been engaged to provide investment
banking or financial advisory services to the Company, Parent, Capital One or Synovus, or Broad Street or Pamplona, except that, in
the first quarter of 2015, Guggenheim Securities was engaged as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Company’s
evaluation of a potential acquisition that the Company elected not to pursue and in respect of which Guggenheim Securities did not
receive any compensation. In addition, Guggenheim Securities has provided financial advisory services on an informal basis to the
Company’s senior management and members of the Board during the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion in connection with
the Company’s assessment of various strategic and financial alternatives, including the merger, for which services Guggenheim
Securities did not receive any compensation other than pursuant to Guggenheim’s current engagement as the Company’s financial
advisor. Guggenheim Securities may in the future seek to provide investment banking or financial advisory services to the Company,
Parent, other participants in the merger or any related transactions and their respective affiliates, for which services Guggenheim
Securities would expect to receive compensation.

Guggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities engage in a wide range of financial services activities for their
own accounts and the accounts of their customers, including: asset, investment and

wealth management; insurance services; investment banking, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and restructuring; merchant
banking; fixed income and equity sales, trading and research; and derivatives, foreign exchange and futures. In the ordinary course of
these activities, Guggenheim Securities or its affiliates and related entities may provide such financial services to the Company, Parent,
other participants in the merger or any related transactions or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio
companies, for which services Guggenheim Securities or its affiliates and related entities have received, and may receive,
compensation. In 2015, Guggenheim Securities participated as a broker in connection with certain stock repurchase programs of the
Company, for which services Guggenheim Securities received customary brokerage commissions. Guggenheim Securities or its
affiliates and related entities may also, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions, trade and otherwise conduct such activities in
or with respect to certain bank debt, debt or equity securities and derivative products of or relating to the Company, Parent, other
participants in the merger or any related transactions or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio
companies. Furthermore, Guggenheim Securities or its affiliates and related entities and our or their respective directors, officers,
employees, consultants and agents may have investments in the Company, Parent, other participants in the merger or any related
transactions or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio companies.

Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory guidelines, Guggenheim Securities has adopted certain policies and
procedures to establish and maintain the independence of its research departments and personnel. As a result, Guggenheim Securities’
research analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and publish research reports with respect to the
Company, Parent, other participants in the merger or any related transactions or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment
funds and portfolio companies and the merger and related transactions that differ from the views of Guggenheim Securities’ investment
banking personnel.

Forward-Looking Financial Information

Given the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates inherent in preparing financial projections, the
Company does not as a matter of general practice publicly disclose detailed projections as to its anticipated financial position or results
of operations, other than providing, from time to time, estimated ranges for the then-current fiscal year of certain expected financial
results in its regular earnings press releases and other investor materials.

In connection with the Company’s evaluation in 2016 of a possible transaction and other strategic alternatives, the
Company’s management prepared forward-looking financial information with respect to fiscal years 2016 through 2020 (which we
refer to as the “original financial projections”), which are summarized below. The Company’s management initially prepared the
original financial projections in February 2016 and provided such projections to the Board and Guggenheim Securities (the “February
2016 financial projections”). In August 2016, the Company’s management updated such financial projections for fiscal year 2016 (the
“August 2016 financial projections”), but no new financial projections were prepared for fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2020.
Such financial projections for fiscal year 2016 also were provided to Guggenheim Securities. In view of the immaterial difference
between the fiscal year 2016 forecast prepared in February 2016 and the fiscal year 2016 forecast prepared in August 2016, the updated
fiscal year 2016 forecast was not provided by the Company’s management to the Board prior to its approval of the original merger
agreement, but was summarized for the Board. Certain portions of the original financial projections were made available to Bass Pro
and its financial advisor in connection with Bass Pro’s due diligence investigation and evaluation of a possible transaction.

Subsequently, in light of the passage of time and developments since the preparation of the original financial projections, in
connection with the Company’s evaluation and negotiation of and entry into the merger agreement amendment in 2017, the Company’s
management prepared updated forward-looking financial information with respect to fiscal years 2017 through 2021 (which we refer to
as the “updated financial

projections” and, together with the original financial projections, the “financial projections”). The Company’s management prepared
the updated financial projections in March 2017 and provided such projections to the Board and to Guggenheim Securities for its use
and reliance in connection with its financial analysis and opinion with respect to the merger consideration of $61.50 in cash per share
of Company common stock set forth in the merger agreement amendment. The updated financial projections were not made available
to Bass Pro or its financial advisor.

The financial projections were prepared assuming the Company’s continued operation on a standalone basis without any
sale of or partnership with respect to the financial services business.

None of the financial projections were intended for public disclosure. A summary of the financial projections is included in
this proxy statement only because the financial projections or certain portions thereof were made available to the Board, Guggenheim
Securities and/or Bass Pro, as applicable. The inclusion of the financial projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an
admission or representation by the Company that the financial projections or the information contained therein is material.

The financial projections are unaudited and were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or compliance with the
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective
financial information or generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the U.S. (which we refer to as “GAAP”) or the
published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Neither the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountant has compiled, examined or performed any
procedures with respect to the financial projections or expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on the financial
projections or their achievability. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm assumes no responsibility for, and
disclaims any association with, the financial projections.

In the view of the Company’s management, the financial projections were prepared on a reasonable basis reflecting
management’s best available estimates and judgments regarding the Company’s future financial performance at the time of their
preparation. You should note that the updated financial projections were intended to supersede and replace the original financial
projections. The financial projections are not facts and should not be relied upon as necessarily predictive of actual future results. You
are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon the financial projections. Some or all of the assumptions that have been made in
connection with the preparation of the financial projections may have changed since the date the financial projections were prepared.
None of the Company, Bass Pro or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives assumes any responsibility for the
validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the financial projections or the ultimate performance of the Company relative to
the financial projections. Except as required by applicable law, neither the Company nor any of its affiliates intends to, and each of
them disclaims any obligation to, update, correct or otherwise revise the financial projections if any or all of them have changed or
change or otherwise have become, are or become inaccurate (even in the short term). These considerations should be taken into account
if evaluating the financial projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.

The financial projections do not necessarily reflect changes in general business or economic conditions since the time they
were prepared, changes in the Company’s businesses or their prospects or any other transactions or events that have occurred or that
may occur and that were not anticipated at the time the financial projections were prepared, and the financial projections are not
necessarily indicative of current values or necessarily predictive of future performance, which may be significantly more favorable or
less favorable than as set forth therein and should not be regarded as a representation that the financial forecasts, projected results or
other estimates and assumptions therein will be achieved.

Because the financial projections reflect subjective judgment in many respects, they are susceptible to multiple
interpretations and frequent revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The financial projections also cover
multiple fiscal years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive

with each succeeding fiscal year. The financial projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to a wide variety of
significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the projected results, including, without
limitation, the factors described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2016, which was filed with the SEC on February 16, 2017, and the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the first quarter ended April 1, 2017, which was filed with the SEC on May 4, 2017, and in the Company’s other public filings
with the SEC. For additional information on factors that may cause the Company’s future financial results to materially vary from the
projected results summarized below, see the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will be realized or that actual results will not differ
materially from the projected results summarized below, and the financial projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future
operating results and should not be relied upon as such. No representation is made by the Company or any of its affiliates, advisors or
other representatives or any other person to any Company stockholder or any other person regarding the actual performance of the
Company compared to the results included in the financial projections or otherwise.

The financial projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other
information regarding the Company contained in the Company’s public filings with the SEC. For a more detailed description of the
information available, see the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information,” on page 153. The financial projections do not
take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared, including the effect of the merger and
related matters. Further, the financial projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the merger to be consummated and
should not be viewed in any manner in that context.

The financial projections reflect various estimates, assumptions and methodologies of the Company, all of which are
difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company’s control, including, among others, assumptions with respect to
industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, litigation, market and financial conditions and matters specific to the
Company’s businesses. Such assumptions include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

 
•  the Company’s continued operation on a standalone basis without any sale of or partnership with respect to the

financial services business;
 

 •  an average of eight new stores opened per year and no stores closed during the periods of the financial projections;
 

 
•  with respect to the original financial projections, an increase in comparable store sales of 1% throughout the period

and, with respect to the updated financial projections, a decrease in comparable store sales of 2% in fiscal year 2017
and an increase in comparable store sales of 1% throughout the remainder of the period;

 

 
•  with respect to the original financial projections, an increase in merchandise gross margins from 34.3% in fiscal year

2015 to 35.2% in fiscal year 2020 and, with respect to the updated financial projections, an increase in merchandise
gross margins from 33.4% in fiscal year 2017 to 33.5% in fiscal year 2021;

 

 

•  with respect to the original financial projections, a decrease in expenses as a percentage of total revenue from 34.5%
in fiscal year 2015 to 33.0% in fiscal year 2020 and, with respect to the updated financial projections, a decrease in
expenses as a percentage of total revenue from 33.9% in fiscal year 2017 to 33.1% in fiscal year 2021 (in each case
driven by improvements from the Company’s previously announced Project Apex cost savings initiative and
improved operating leverage);

quarter of 2016, $157 million in fiscal year 2017, $167 million in fiscal year

In addition, certain of the financial projections are non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA net income and

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

Members of the Board and our executive officers have various interests in the merger described in this section that may be
in addition to, or different from, the interests of Company stockholders generally. You should keep this in mind when considering the
recommendation of the Board “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement. The members of the Board were aware of these interests
and considered them at the time they approved the merger agreement and in making their recommendation that Company stockholders
adopt the merger agreement. These interests are described below.

Certain Assumptions

Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this
section, the following assumptions, as well as those described in the footnotes to the table in the section titled “—Golden Parachute
Compensation” below were used:
 

 

•  the relevant price per share of Company common stock is $61.50 per share, which, absent an adjustment in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, is the fixed price per share to be received by our stockholders in
respect of their shares of Company common stock in connection with the merger (however, as noted earlier in this
proxy statement, under certain circumstances, the merger consideration may be increased to be $65.50 per share);

 

 
•  the effective time is May 30, 2017, which is the assumed date of the effective time solely for purposes of the

disclosure in this section (the “assumed effective time”);
 

 
•  the employment of each executive officer of the Company is terminated without “cause” or due to the executive

officer’s resignation for “good reason” (as each such term is defined in the relevant plan(s) and/or agreement(s)), in
each case, immediately following the assumed effective time; and

 

 
•  the service of each non-employee director of the Company is terminated immediately following the assumed effective

time.

Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards and Equity Plans

The merger agreement provides that, as of immediately prior to the effective time:
 

 

•  each Company option will be fully vested and cancelled by virtue of the merger and, in exchange therefor, each holder
of any such cancelled Company option will be entitled to receive a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product
of (i) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such cancelled Company option, and (ii) the excess,
if any, of the applicable merger consideration over the exercise price per share subject to such cancelled Company
option, without interest; provided, however, that (A) any such Company option with respect to which the exercise
price per share subject thereto is equal or greater than the applicable merger consideration will be cancelled in
exchange for no consideration and (B) the option payments will be reduced by the amount of any required tax
withholdings as contemplated by the merger agreement; and

 

 

•  each RSU award will be fully vested (with any performance conditions applicable to such RSU award deemed
satisfied in full) and cancelled by virtue of the merger and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled
RSU award will be entitled to receive a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Company common stock subject to such cancelled RSU award and (ii) the applicable merger consideration;
provided, however, that such cash payment will be reduced by the amount of any required tax withholdings as
contemplated by the merger agreement.

The merger agreement provides that, (a) as of the effective time, the Company’s 2004 Stock Plan, the Company’s 2013
Stock Plan, and the inducement grant program established by the Company will be terminated and (b) as of immediately prior to the
effective time, the Company’s 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be terminated.

Non-Employee Directors

The following table sets forth the cash proceeds that each of our non-employee directors would receive in respect of
outstanding equity awards, whether or not vested, held by such director as of the assumed effective time in accordance with the
treatment of outstanding equity awards and equity plans described above. Depending on when the effective time occurs, certain of
these equity awards may vest, be exercised and/or cancelled, in each case, prior to the actual effective time in accordance with their
terms and independent of the occurrence of the merger. All share and unit numbers have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

Change in Control Severance and Incentive Benefits for Executive Officers

The Company has entered into agreements containing change in control provisions with each of its executive officers, other
than James W. Cabela (which we refer to individually as a “CIC agreement” and collectively, the “CIC agreements”). The terms of the
CIC agreements are substantially similar for each of the executive officers. Under the CIC agreements, if the employment of any of the
Company’s executive officers (other than Mr. Cabela) is terminated without “cause” or if the executive officer resigns for “good
reason” within 24 months of a “change in control” (as defined in the CIC agreements, and which includes the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement), then the executive officer would be entitled to receive severance benefits equal to 2.99 times
the executive officer’s annual base salary and bonus, payable in a lump sum, and

Table of Contents

continued coverage under the Company’s welfare insurance benefits for a period of 18 months from the date of the executive officer’s
termination of employment. The bonus element of this payment would be equal to the average of the last two incentive bonuses paid to
the executive officer.

Each of the CIC agreements also provides that any unvested equity awards held by the executive officer that did not vest
upon the change in control would become fully vested.

Further, each of the CIC agreements provides that any non-competition and non-solicitation agreements that the Company
has entered into with the executive officer would automatically terminate. All confidentiality provisions, however, would remain in
place.

Under the CIC agreements, “cause” means a termination of the executive officer’s employment because (i) the executive
officer is charged with a felony, (ii) in the reasonable determination of the Company, the executive officer has committed an act of
fraud, embezzlement or theft relating to the Company, (iii) in the reasonable determination of the Company, the executive officer has
committed gross negligence in the course of his employment with the Company that is materially detrimental to the business of the
Company, (iv) the executive officer fails to fulfill his duties as an employee of the Company, including inattention to or neglect of his
duties, and has not remedied such failure within 30 days after receiving written notice from the Company specifying the details thereof,
or (v) of a third occurrence of the same action or inaction which caused the Company to previously give the executive officer notice
under clause (iv).    

Under the CIC agreements, in relevant part, “good reason” means actions taken by the Company resulting in a material
negative change in the employment relationship, including: (i) a material diminution in the executive officer’s base compensation; (ii) a
material diminution in the executive officer’s authority, duties or responsibilities; (iii) a material diminution in the authority, duties or
responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the executive officer is required to report, including, if the executive officer reports directly
to the Board, a requirement that the executive officer report to a corporate officer or employee instead of reporting directly to the
Board; (iv) a material diminution in the budget over which the executive officer retains authority; (v) a change in the executive
officer’s principal place of employment by a distance in excess of 100 miles from its location immediately prior to the change in
control; (vi) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of an agreement under which the executive
officer provides services to the Company; or (vii) the failure by the Company to obtain the assumption of the CIC agreement by any
successor to the Company.

In lieu of granting its ordinary course 2017 equity-based incentive awards to the Company’s executive officers because of
restrictions imposed by the merger agreement, on March 2, 2017, the Company (or, in the case of Mr. Baker, WFB) entered into cash
incentive award letters with each of the Company’s executive officers¸ other than James W. Cabela (which we refer to collectively as
the “award letters”). Under the award letters, the executive officers are entitled to cash incentive compensation awards subject to the
following vesting conditions: (i) 50% of the incentive award vests if the executive officer remains in the Company’s or WFB’s, as
applicable, continuous employment through the first anniversary of the grant date; (ii) the remaining 50% of the incentive award vests
if the executive officer remains in the Company’s or WFB’s, as applicable, continuous employment through the second anniversary of
the grant date; and (iii) any unvested portion of the incentive award will become fully vested if either (a) a change in control, including
the consummation of the merger, occurs prior to the second anniversary of the grant date and the executive officer remains in the
Company’s or WFB’s, as applicable, continuous employment through such date or (b) the executive officer’s employment with the
Company or WFB, as applicable, terminates prior to the second anniversary of the grant date due to death or disability. The cash
incentive awards granted pursuant to the award letters are settled in cash (less applicable tax withholding) on the applicable vesting
date.

For illustrative purposes only, based on the assumptions described above under “—Certain Assumptions,” it is currently estimated
that the Company’s current executive officers would be entitled to receive, in the aggregate, approximately $15,943,150 in cash in
severance benefits and incentive payments under the CIC

agreements and award letters. See the section titled “—Golden Parachute Compensation” below for an estimate of the amounts that
would become payable to each of the Company’s named executive officers under the CIC agreements and award letters.

Golden Parachute Compensation

The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires
disclosure of compensation that each named executive officer could receive that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger. This
compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use such
term to describe the merger-related compensation payable to the Company’s named executive officers. For additional details regarding
the terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion above. This merger-related compensation is subject to a
non-binding advisory vote of Company stockholders, as set forth in proposal 2 to this proxy statement. See the section entitled
“Proposal 2: Non-Binding Advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal,” on page 32.

The amounts set forth below are estimates of amounts that would be payable to the named executive officers using the
assumptions above described under “—Certain Assumptions.” These estimates are based on multiple assumptions that may or may not
actually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement. Some of the assumptions are based on information not
currently available, and as a result the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may differ in material
respects from the amounts set forth below. All dollar amounts set forth below have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

completion of the merger and with respect to which payment is not conditioned upon the named executive officer’s qualifying
termination of employment). The amounts reported in the “Perquisites/Benefits” column are attributable double-trigger
arrangements described above. The amounts reported in the “Equity” column are attributable to a single-trigger arrangement (i.e.,
the accelerated vesting and payment in cancellation of Company options and RSU awards will occur upon completion of the
merger and with respect to which payment is not conditioned upon the named executive officer’s qualifying termination of
employment).

(2) Amounts reflect (i) cash severance benefits that would be payable in a lump sum under the CIC agreements, assuming a
termination of employment by the Company other than for cause, disability, retirement or the named executive officer’s death, or
resignation by the named executive officer for good reason, in each case, within 24 months after a change in control (Mr. Millner,
$3,743,295, Mr. Williams, $2,559,425, Mr. Baker, $1,590,578, Mr. Baldwin, $1,490,697, Mr. Castner, $1,700,024, and
Mr. Copeland, $1,622,524) and (ii) cash incentive awards that would be payable in a lump sum under the award letters assuming
completion of the merger (Mr. Millner, $1,200,000, Mr. Williams, $750,000, Mr. Baker, $375,000, Mr. Baldwin, $375,000,
Mr. Castner, $375,000, and Mr. Copeland, $0). The cash severance benefits and incentive payments payable under the CIC
agreements and award letters, respectively, are described in more detail above in the section entitled “—Change in Control
Severance and Incentive Benefits for Executive Officers.” While Mr. Copeland is no longer an executive officer of the Company,
he remains entitled to receive benefits under the CIC agreements based on his continued service with the Company. Mr. Copeland
is not entitled to receive benefits under the award letters.

(3) Amounts reflect the cash consideration to be received by each named executive officer in connection with the accelerated vesting
and cancellation and termination of unvested Company options and RSU awards held by each of the named executive officers,
which acceleration of vesting will occur upon completion of the merger, as described in more detail above in the section entitled
“— Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards and Equity Plans.” The cash consideration to be received by each named executive
officer with respect to the accelerated vesting and cancellation of unvested Company options and RSU awards held by each of the
named executive officers is summarized in the following table:

Michael Copeland    20,765    179,292    14,426    887,199 

As noted earlier in this proxy statement, under certain circumstances, the merger consideration may be increased to up to $65.50
per share. In the event the per share merger consideration is increased from $61.50 to $65.50 per share, the estimated total cash
consideration to be received by each executive officer for unvested equity awards would be as follows: Mr. Millner, $5,691,267;
Mr. Williams, $3,664,513; Mr. Baker, $1,171,831; Mr. Baldwin, $1,171,831; Mr. Castner, $1,193,839; and Mr. Copeland,
$1,193,839.

(4) The Company does not maintain any pension or nonqualified deferred compensation benefits.
(5) Amounts reflect the payments in respect of continued coverage under the Company’s welfare insurance benefits for a period of 18

months following the named executive officer’s termination of employment, as provided for under the CIC agreements, as
described in detail above in the section entitled “—Change in Control Severance and Incentive Benefits for Executive Officers,”
and estimated based on the current insurance rates under the applicable plans. These benefits consist of: (i) $33,945 for 18 months
of health and dental insurance and (ii) $1,152 for 18 months of life and disability insurance.

(6) None of the named executive officers are eligible to receive a tax reimbursement based on or otherwise related to the merger.

Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance Information

Pursuant to the merger agreement, from and after the effective time until the sixth anniversary thereof, Parent is obligated to
cause the surviving corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and the Company’s or its applicable subsidiaries’
organizational documents, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former director or officer of the Company or any of the
Company’s subsidiaries and each fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (we refer to each as an
“indemnified party”), against (i) all losses, expenses (include reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims,
damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at the effective time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time) to the extent that they are based
on or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or fiduciary under benefit plans prior to the effective time (which
we refer to as “indemnified liabilities”), and (ii) all indemnified liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out of or pertain to
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time, and
including any expenses incurred in enforcing such person’s rights. In the event of any such loss, expense, claim, damage or liability
(whether or not asserted before the effective time), the surviving corporation will promptly pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel selected by the indemnified parties promptly after statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to such indemnified
party upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred (provided that the person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to indemnification under the law).

Also, the Company will be permitted to, prior to the effective time (and, if the Company fails to do so, Parent will cause the
surviving corporation to), obtain and fully pay the premium for a “tail” insurance and indemnification policy for a claims reporting
period of six years from and after the effective time for events occurring prior to the effective time (which we refer to as the “D&O
insurance”) that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended beneficiaries thereof
than the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy. However, without the prior written consent of Parent,
neither the Company nor Parent will purchase such a “tail” policy for a premium amount for any one year in excess of 300% of the
annual premium paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance (which we refer to as the “tail cap”). If
the Company and the surviving corporation for any reason fail to obtain such “tail” insurance policy as of the effective time, the
surviving corporation will, and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
years from and after the effective time (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six year period
thereunder are being adjudicated) the D&O insurance in place as of the date of the merger agreement with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of the merger
agreement, or the surviving corporation will, and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to, purchase comparable D&O insurance
for such six year period (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six year period thereunder are being
adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing
policies as of the date of the merger agreement, provided that neither Parent nor the surviving corporation will be required to pay an
aggregate annual premium for such D&O insurance to the extent exceeding 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for
coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance and if the premiums of such insurance coverage with respect to any policy year
exceed the tail cap, the surviving corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to
matters occurring prior to the effective time, for a cost not exceeding the tail cap.

In addition, for not less than six years following the effective time, Parent and the surviving corporation must maintain
provisions in the organizational documents of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses that are no less favorable than the analogous provisions contained in the organizational
documents of the Company and its subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the effective time. The publicly filed contractual
indemnification rights of the

directors and officers of the Company will be assumed by the surviving corporation and will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms following the effective time.

For additional information, see the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Director and Officer
Indemnification and Insurance Information,” beginning on page 121.

Certain Effects of the Merger

If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved by the holders of shares of Company common stock representing
a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter and the other conditions to the closing
of the merger are either satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived, Sub will be merged with and into the Company
upon the terms set forth in the merger agreement. As the surviving corporation in the merger, the Company will continue to exist
following the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

Following the completion of the merger, all of the Company’s equity interests will be beneficially owned by Parent, and
none of the Company’s current stockholders will, by virtue of the merger, have any ownership interest in, or be a stockholder of, the
Company, the surviving corporation or Parent. As a result, the Company’s current stockholders will no longer benefit from any increase
in the value, nor will they bear the risk of any decrease in the value, of Company common stock. Following the merger, Parent will
benefit from any increase in the Company’s value and also will bear the risk of any decrease in the Company’s value.

At the effective time, except as described below, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time (other than (i) shares of Company common stock that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of
record by any subsidiary of the Company and all shares owned of record by Parent, Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, in each
case immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) shares of Company common stock held by stockholders who have not voted in
favor of, or consented to the adoption of, the merger agreement and who have properly demanded appraisal of such shares and
complied in all respects with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of shares to request appraisal of their
shares) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $61.50 in cash, without interest thereon, subject to any
applicable withholding taxes and the following paragraph.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger consideration will be adjusted as follows in the event that the bank
framework agreement is validly terminated, although the merger agreement provides that the merger cannot close until the financial
services business has been sold and the bank framework agreement can only be terminated in certain circumstances, as described in the
section entitled “The Bank Sale Agreements—Termination Rights; Effect of Termination,” beginning on page 134:
 

 

•  in the event that the bank framework agreement is validly terminated by Synovus in accordance with its terms and the
original bank purchase agreement is automatically deemed to be re-executed in its original form pursuant to the terms
thereof, as further described below, then the merger consideration to be paid by Parent if the closing of the sale of the
financial services business and the closing of the merger occurs will be $62.50 per share in cash, without interest
thereon; and

 

 
•  in the event that the bank framework agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms such that none of

the original bank purchase agreement, the bank framework agreement and the credit card program agreement remains
in effect pursuant to the terms thereof, then either, at the Company’s election,

 

 

•  such merger consideration to be paid by Parent if the closing of the sale of the financial services business
and the closing of the merger occurs will be $65.50 per share in cash, without interest thereon, and the
Company will generally be restricted from entering into an alternative transaction with respect to the
financial services business on terms that are

materially less favorable than those of the original bank purchase agreement and the credit card program
agreement, in its original form without giving effect to any amendments thereto, without Parent’s prior
written consent, or

 

 

•  such merger consideration to be paid by Parent if the closing of the sale of the financial services business
and the closing of the merger occurs will be $62.50 per share in cash, without interest thereon, and the
Company will generally be restricted from entering into an alternative transaction with respect to the
financial services business on terms that are materially less favorable than those of the original bank
purchase agreement and the credit card program agreement, as amended, without Parent’s prior written
consent.

As noted above, the merger agreement provides that the merger cannot close until the financial services business has been
sold, and Capital One previously informed the Company that it did not expect that the original bank transaction with Capital One (in
the event Synovus terminates the framework agreement and the original agreement is deemed re-executed) could be consummated
prior to the outside date of October 3, 2017. After the outside date, either Parent or the Company generally can terminate the merger
agreement if the merger has not been consummated. The Board considered these and related factors in connection with evaluating the
merger agreement (as amended by the merger agreement amendment), including its view that the bank framework agreement with
Synovus and Capital One presented the best opportunity for the Company to consummate a transaction on a similar time frame as that
contemplated at the signing of the original merger agreement that preserved substantially all of the merger consideration provided by
the original merger agreement. See “The Merger—Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Effect of the
Merger Agreement Amendment” beginning on page 66.

For information regarding the effects of the merger on the Company’s outstanding equity awards and the Company’s equity
plans, please see the section entitled “—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on page 87, and the
section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards and Equity Plans,” beginning on
page 107.

Company common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and trades on the NYSE under the symbol “CAB.”
Following the completion of the merger, shares of Company common stock will no longer be traded on the NYSE or any other public
market. In addition, the registration of shares of Company common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated, and the Company
will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC with respect to Company common stock. Termination of
registration of Company common stock under the Exchange Act will reduce the information required to be furnished by the Company
to the Company’s stockholders and the SEC, and would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the requirement to file
annual and quarterly reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the short-swing trading provisions of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement to furnish a proxy statement in connection with stockholders’ meetings
pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, no longer applicable to the Company, to the extent that such provisions apply solely as
a result of the registration of Company common stock under the Exchange Act.

Consequences if the Merger is Not Completed

If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is not approved by the holders of shares representing a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter or if the merger is not completed for any other reason,
you will not receive any consideration from Parent or Sub for your shares of Company common stock. Instead, the Company will
remain a public company, and Company common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. We expect that holders of
shares of Company common stock would continue to be subject to the same risks to which they are currently subject to with respect to
their ownership of Company common stock. If the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and
opportunities on the future value of Company common stock, including the risk that the market

Table of Contents

price of Company common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of Company common stock reflects a market
assumption that the merger will be completed. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is not approved by the holders of shares
representing a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote on such matter, or if the merger is not
completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to us will be offered or that our
business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.

The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
specified conditions set forth in the merger agreement. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement does not receive the required
approval from Company stockholders or the merger agreement is otherwise terminated, the transactions contemplated by the bank sale
agreements may not be consummated.

In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, the Company is required to pay Parent a
termination fee of $126,000,000. Upon termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, Parent will be obligated to
pay the Company a termination fee of $230,000,000. In the event that the bank sale agreements are terminated under certain
circumstances in which the Company termination fee is payable by the Company to Parent under the merger agreement, Capital One
will be entitled to receive from the Company a termination fee of $14,000,000. In the event that the bank sale agreements are
terminated after the Company and Parent mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement and, in connection with the termination,
Parent receives any payment or fee from the Company, Capital One will be entitled to receive from the Company a termination fee of
10% of the aggregate payment or fee received by Parent from the Company. In the event that the bank sale agreements are terminated
under certain specified circumstances (including in certain specified circumstances after the merger agreement is terminated), Synovus
will be entitled to receive from Capital One a termination fee of $10,000,000, plus the amount of certain costs and expenses. In certain
circumstances, WFB is obligated to reimburse Capital One for up to $10,000,000 of such termination fee and such costs and expenses
paid to Synovus. See the sections entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger—Expenses; Termination Fees,” beginning on page 127
and “The Bank Sale Agreements—Termination Rights; Effect of Termination,” beginning on page 134.

Financing of the Merger

We anticipate that the total funds needed to complete the merger, including the funds needed to pay Company stockholders
and holders of other equity-based interests the amounts due to them under the merger agreement, which would be approximately
$4.584 billion based upon the number of shares of Company common stock (and our other equity-based interests) outstanding as of
May 17, 2017, will be funded through a combination of up to approximately $5.145 billion of debt financing and up to approximately
$2.383 billion of equity financing.

Preferred Equity Financing

Parent has entered into a preferred financing commitment letter, dated as of October 3, 2016, from Broad Street and
Pamplona which obligates the preferred equity financing commitment parties to fund to Parent an aggregate amount of $2,382,740,000,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the preferred financing commitment letter, for the purpose of enabling Parent to fund a
portion of the merger consideration. The Company is a party to the preferred financing commitment letter for purposes of enforcing the
preferred equity financing commitment parties’ respective obligations under the preferred financing commitment letter and has the
ability to specifically enforce the preferred financing commitment letter if (i) all of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of such conditions), as more fully described in
the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger — Conditions to the Merger,” beginning on page 124, (ii) Parent fails to
complete the closing on the date the closing should have otherwise occurred under the merger agreement, (iii) the debt financing has
been

Table of Contents

funded or will be funded at the closing if the equity financing is funded at the closing and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed
in writing to Parent that the closing will occur if specific performance is granted and the debt financing and equity financing is funded,
in each case subject to the conditions and limitations described in the section entitled “The Agreement and Plan of Merger —
Miscellaneous—Specific Performance” beginning on page 129. Each preferred equity financing commitment party may assign a
portion of its preferred financing commitment to other parties, although no assignment of the preferred financing commitment to such
other parties will limit the preferred equity financing commitment parties’ respective obligations under the preferred financing
commitment letter. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. has provided to Parent a limited guaranty of the obligations of Broad Street, under
the preferred financing commitment letter, to which the Company is a party for the same purposes as it is a party to the preferred
financing commitment letter.

Debt Financing

Parent has entered into a debt commitment letter, dated as of October 3, 2016, with the debt commitment parties. Pursuant to
and subject to the terms of the debt commitment letter, the debt commitment parties committed to arrange and underwrite senior
secured credit facilities in an aggregate amount of up to $5.145 billion to, among other things, (i) pay the merger consideration payable
under the merger agreement, (ii) refinance certain existing indebtedness for borrowed money and (iii) pay any and all fees and
expenses in connection with the merger or the financing thereof. In order to facilitate the debt financing, a portion of the debt financing
was funded into escrow pursuant to the term loan credit agreement and upon satisfaction of the conditions described in the term loan
credit agreement, the escrowed proceeds will be released to fund a portion of the merger consideration. The debt commitment letter
terminates automatically on the earliest to occur of (A) the consummation of the merger with or without the funding of the debt
financing, (B) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms and (C) 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the outside
date, except that the outside date may be extended pursuant to certain amendments, modifications or consents to the merger agreement.
The term loan credit agreement will terminate (and the escrowed proceeds will be repaid) if the escrowed proceeds have not been
released to Parent prior to the earliest to occur of (A) the abandonment of the merger, (B) the termination of the merger agreement in
accordance with its terms and (C) April 3, 2018.

Although the debt financing is not subject to a due diligence or “market out,” the obligations of the escrow agent to release
the funds from escrow and the obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment
letter are subject to certain customary conditions, and such financing should not be considered assured. There is a risk that these
conditions will not be satisfied and the portion of the commitment that was not funded into escrow may not be funded, or the escrow
agent may not release the funds from escrow when required. To the knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this proxy statement,
no alternative financing arrangements or alternative financing plans have been made in the event the debt financing described in this
proxy statement is not available.

The completion of the merger is not conditioned upon Parent’s or Sub’s receipt of financing.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to beneficial owners of
Company common stock who receive cash for their shares of Company common stock in the merger. This summary is general in
nature and does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to a beneficial owner of shares in light of
such beneficial owner’s particular circumstances. In addition, this summary does not describe any tax consequences arising under the
laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation.
This summary only addresses shares of Company common stock held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the “code”) (generally, property held for investment). This summary
does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of shares who demand appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL. This summary does not address

all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare
contribution tax on net investment income. This summary also does not address tax considerations applicable to any holder of shares
that may be subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including:
 

 •  a bank, insurance company or other financial institution;
 

 •  a tax-exempt organization or governmental organization;
 

 •  a retirement plan or other tax-deferred account;
 

 
•  a partnership, an S corporation or other entity treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or

an investor in such an entity);
 

 •  a mutual fund;
 

 •  a real estate investment trust or regulated investment company;
 

 •  a personal holding company;
 

 •  a dealer or broker in stocks and securities or currencies;
 

 •  a trader in securities that elects mark-to-market treatment;
 

 •  a holder of shares subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the code;
 

 
•  a holder of shares that received the shares through the exercise of an employee stock option, through a tax qualified

retirement plan or otherwise as compensation;
 

 •  a U.S. holder (as described below) that has a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;
 

 
•  a “controlled foreign corporation,” “passive foreign investment company” or corporation that accumulates earnings to

avoid U.S. federal income tax;
 

 
•  a holder that holds shares as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other risk reduction strategy or

integrated transaction; or
 

 •  a U.S. expatriate or a former citizen or long-time resident of the United States.

This summary is based on the code, the treasury regulations promulgated under the code and rulings and judicial decisions,
all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement, and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, with
possible retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely
affect a holder of the shares. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (which
we refer to as the “IRS”) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary. No assurance can
be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this summary, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in
the event of litigation.

THIS DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL
INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO A HOLDER OF SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. WE URGE
BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF SHARES TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING FEDERAL
ESTATE, GIFT AND OTHER NON-INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE,
LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS, OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY, INCLUDING POSSIBLE
CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS OR TREATIES.

For purposes of this discussion, we use the term “U.S. holder” to mean a beneficial owner of shares of Company common
stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 

 •  an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
 

 
•  a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under

the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 
•  a trust that (i) is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more

U.S. persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the code) or (ii) has a valid election in effect under
applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or

 

 •  an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.

We use the term “non-U.S. holder” to mean a beneficial owner of Company common stock (other than a partnership or
other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. holder.

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
beneficially owns shares of Company common stock, the tax treatment of the partnership and its partners generally will depend on the
status of the partners and the activities of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding shares of Company common stock should
consult such partner’s tax advisor.

U.S. Holders

General. A U.S. holder’s receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger will be a
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and a U.S. holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of Company
common stock in the merger will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the
U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a share generally will be equal to the amount the
U.S. holder paid for the share. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Company common stock (that is,
shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain
or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period for the shares is more than one year at the effective time. Long-term capital gain recognized
by individuals and other non-corporate persons that are U.S. holders generally is subject to tax at a reduced rate of U.S. federal income
tax. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding. A U.S. holder may be subject to information reporting. In addition, all
payments to which a U.S. holder would be entitled pursuant to the merger will be subject to backup withholding at the statutory rate
unless such holder (i) is a corporation or other exempt recipient (and, when required, demonstrates this fact), or (ii) provides a taxpayer
identification number (which we refer to as a “TIN”) and certifies, under penalty of perjury, that the U.S. holder is not subject to
backup withholding, and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A U.S. holder that does not
otherwise establish exemption should complete and sign the IRS Form W-9, in order to provide the information and certification
necessary to avoid backup withholding and possible penalties. If a U.S. holder does not provide a correct TIN, such U.S. holder may be
subject to backup withholding and penalties imposed by the IRS.

Any amount paid as backup withholding does not constitute an additional tax and will be creditable against a U.S. holder’s
U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is given to the IRS in a timely manner. If backup withholding
results in an overpayment of tax, a U.S. holder may obtain a refund by filing a U.S. federal income tax return in a timely manner.
U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to qualifications for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for
obtaining the exemption.

Table of Contents

Non-U.S. Holders

General. A non-U.S. holder’s receipt of cash for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the merger generally will
not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
 

 
•  the non-U.S. holder is an individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year

of the merger and certain other conditions are met;
 

 
•  the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States and, if

required by an applicable tax treaty, attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in
the United States; or

 

 

•  we are or have been a United States real property holding corporation, or “USRPHC,” for U.S. federal income tax
purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the merger or the period that the
non-U.S. holder held our shares and the non-U.S. holder held (actually or constructively) more than five percent of
our shares at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the merger.

Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to tax at a flat rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may
be specified under an applicable income tax treaty), net of applicable U.S.-source losses from sales or exchanges of other capital assets
recognized by such non-U.S. holder during the taxable year even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United
States, provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses. Unless a tax treaty
provides otherwise, gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis in
the same manner as if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder. A non-U.S. holder that is a foreign corporation also may be subject to a
30% branch profits tax (or applicable lower treaty rate). Non-U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to any applicable
tax treaties that might provide for different rules.

With respect to the third bullet point above, the determination whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value
of our United States real property interests relative to the fair market value of our other trade or business assets and our United States
and foreign real property interests. We believe that we have not been a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time
during the five-year period ending on the date of the merger.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding. Information reporting and backup withholding will generally apply to
payments made pursuant to the merger to a non-U.S. holder effected by or through the U.S. office of any broker, U.S. or foreign, unless
the holder certifies its status as a non-U.S. holder and satisfies certain other requirements, or otherwise establishes an exemption.
Dispositions effected through a non-U.S. office of a U.S. broker or a non-U.S. broker with substantial U.S. ownership or operations
generally will be treated in a manner similar to dispositions effected through a U.S. office of a broker. A non-U.S. holder must
generally submit an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8) attesting to its exempt foreign status in
order to qualify as an exempt recipient. Any amount paid as backup withholding does not constitute an additional tax and will be
creditable against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is given to the IRS in a
timely manner. If backup withholding results in an overpayment of tax, a non-U.S. holder may obtain a refund by filing a U.S. federal
income tax return in a timely manner. Non-U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to qualifications for exemption from
backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining the exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may also
be made available under an applicable tax treaty or information exchange agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the
non-U.S. holder resides or is established.

CASH FOR THEIR SHARES PURSUANT TO THE MERGER UNDER ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, FOREIGN, LOCAL
OR OTHER TAX LAWS, OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.

Regulatory Approvals

Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976

On October 25, 2016 the Company and Parent filed their respective notification and report forms under the HSR Act with
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the “DOJ”) and the United States Federal Trade Commission
(which we refer to as the “FTC”), which triggered the start of the HSR Act waiting period. The statutory waiting period was originally
scheduled to expire on November 25, 2016. Effective November 25, 2016, with the Company’s prior consent, Parent voluntarily
withdrew its HSR Act notification to provide the FTC an extension beyond the initial 30-day HSR Act waiting period to conduct its
review. On November 29, 2016, Parent re-filed its HSR Act notification with the FTC and DOJ.

On December 29, 2016, each of the Company and Parent received a request for additional information and documentary
material, commonly referred to as a “second request,” from the FTC, pursuant to the HSR Act. The FTC’s “second request” had the
effect of extending the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the merger until the 30th day after substantial compliance by
the Company and Parent with the “second request,” unless the waiting period was extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated
sooner by the FTC.

On February 13, 2017, each of the Company and Parent received a notification from the Office of the Attorney General of
the Commonwealth of Virginia (which we refer to as the “Virginia Attorney General”) that the Virginia Attorney General intended to
collaborate with the FTC to review the merger.

On April 3, 2017 the Company certified substantial compliance with the FTC’s “second request” and on April 14, 2017
Parent so certified substantial compliance.

On April 17, 2017, Parent, with the consent of the Company, entered into a timing agreement with the FTC pursuant to
which Parent agreed, among other things, not to complete the merger until at least 75 days after both the Company and Parent certified
substantial compliance with the FTC’s request for additional information and documentary material relating to the merger issued on
December 29, 2016, unless the FTC notifies the Company and Parent that it has closed its review sooner. The Company and Parent are
continuing to work closely and cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the proposed merger.

Competition Act (Canada)

On October 25, 2016, the Company and Parent each filed with the Canadian Competition Bureau (which we refer to as the
“Bureau”) pre-merger notification forms pursuant to Section 114(1) of the Competition Act (Canada) (which we refer to as the
“Competition Act”), which triggered the start of the 30-day statutory waiting period under the Competition Act. The waiting period
was originally scheduled to expire on November 24, 2016, unless a Supplementary Information Request (which we refer to as a “SIR”)
was issued by the Bureau pursuant to subsection 114(2) of the Competition Act.

On November 24, 2016, the Company and Parent each received from the Bureau a SIR pursuant to subsection 114(2) of the
Competition Act. The issuance of the SIR had the effect of extending the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the merger
under the Competition Act until 30 days after substantial compliance by the Company and Parent with the SIR.

On February 17, 2017 Parent certified substantial compliance with the SIR issued to it and, on March 19, 2017, the
Company certified substantial compliance with the SIR issued to it. The waiting period under the Competition Act expired on April 19,
2017.

Table of Contents

On May 5, 2017, the Bureau issued a no action letter which signified that the merger had received clearance under the
Competition Act.

Investment Canada Act

On October 25, 2016, Parent also filed with the Cultural Sector Investment Review Division of the Department of Canadian
Heritage an Application for Review under the Investment Canada Act (which we refer to as the “ICA”). Under the ICA, there is a
statutory 45-day waiting period, which can be unilaterally extended by the Minister of Canadian Heritage for an additional 30 days and
which was voluntarily extended by Parent. On May 10, 2017, Parent’s investment was approved pursuant to the ICA.

Regulatory Conditions to Completion of the Merger

At any time before or after the effective time, the DOJ, the FTC, antitrust authorities outside of the United States or
U.S. state attorneys general could take action under applicable antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger,
conditionally approving the merger upon the divestiture of the Company’s or Parent’s assets, subjecting the completion of the merger to
regulatory conditions or seeking other remedies. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances.

Completion of the merger is conditioned on the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (and any
extension thereof) under the HSR Act and the absence of any order, verdict, decision, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, rule, ruling,
directive, stipulation, determination or award by a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that is in effect and renders the merger
illegal, or prohibits, enjoins or otherwise prevents the merger.

Completion of the merger is also conditioned on the consummation of the purchase and sale of the financial services
business in accordance with the bank sale agreements and merger of WFB into the Company or another subsidiary of the Company and
termination of its bank charter. Under the bank sale agreements, the obligations of Capital One, Synovus, the Company and WFB are
subject to, among other things, (i) approval by the FRB of a BMA application filed by Synovus with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the bank sale agreements and expiration of any related required post-approval waiting period and (ii) notice to the
Nebraska Department of Banking & Finance of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements. The BMA application was
filed by Synovus on April 19, 2017 and notice of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements was given to the Nebraska
Department of Banking & Finance on April 19, 2017. On May 10, 2017, Synovus received notice from the FRB that, because of the
receipt of a public comment, Synovus’s BMA application was transferred from “Delegated Action” to “Board Action.” On May 19,
2017, Synovus received a second public comment from a different entity.

We currently expect to obtain all antitrust and other regulatory approvals that are required for the completion of the merger
during the third quarter of 2017, however, we cannot guarantee when any such approvals will be obtained, or that they will be obtained
at all.

THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

The summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement set forth below and elsewhere in this proxy statement is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, which
reflects the effect of the merger agreement amendment and which is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement. This summary
does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. We
encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully in its entirety.

The merger agreement is described in this proxy statement and included as Annex A only to provide you with information
regarding their terms and conditions and not to provide any other factual information regarding the Company, Parent or Sub or their
respective businesses. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement or, in the case of the Company, in the public
filings that the Company makes with the SEC, which are available without charge through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. See the
section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information,” on page 153.

The representations, warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by the Company, Parent and Sub are qualified
and subject to important limitations agreed to by the Company, Parent and Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger
agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this
summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purposes of
establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to close the merger if the
representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk
between the parties to the merger agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of
materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC, and in some cases
were qualified by the Company disclosure letter, which such disclosures are not reflected in the text of the merger agreement.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of
the date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or new
information qualifying a representation or warranty may or may not have been included in this proxy statement.

Date of the Merger Agreement

The original merger agreement was executed by the Company, Parent and Sub on October 3, 2016 and was amended by the
merger agreement amendment on April 17, 2017 (the “date of the merger agreement”).

Merger Agreement Amendment

The description that follows is of the original merger agreement as it has been amended by the merger agreement
amendment. For more information concerning the merger agreement, please review the copy of the merger agreement attached as
Annex A, which reflects the effect of the merger agreement amendment. For more information about the background of and reasons for
the merger agreement amendment, see the sections entitled “The Merger—Background of the Merger,” beginning on page 34, and
“The Merger—Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement,” beginning on page 64.

The Merger

The merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL, at the effective time, Sub will be merged with and

into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Sub will thereupon cease and the Company will continue as the surviving
corporation of the merger. As a result of the merger, the Company, as the surviving corporation, will succeed to and assume all of the
rights and obligations of Sub and the Company in accordance with the DGCL, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

Closing; Effective Time of the Merger

The closing of the merger will take place on the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in the merger agreement (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or, if permissible, waiver of such conditions) or another time, date or place agreed to in writing by the parties to the merger agreement.

Concurrently with the closing of the merger, the Company will file a certificate of merger in such form as required by, and
executed in accordance with, the applicable provisions of the DGCL, at which time we expect the merger will become effective.

Organizational Documents; Directors and Officers

The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time, (i) the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the
surviving corporation, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time, will be amended and restated in a form agreed upon by the
parties until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law and the applicable provisions of the amended and restated certificate
of incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws of the surviving corporation, and (ii) the parties will cause the bylaws of Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the effective time, to be the bylaws of the surviving corporation (except that references to the name of
Sub will be replaced by references to the name of the surviving corporation) until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
law and the applicable provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws of the
surviving corporation.

Additionally, the merger agreement provides that the board of directors of the surviving corporation effective as of, and
immediately following, the effective time will consist of the members of the board of directors of Sub immediately prior to the
effective time. Furthermore, from and after the effective time, the officers of Sub at the effective time will be the officers of the
surviving corporation. Each such director and officer will hold office in accordance with the amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws of the surviving corporation.

Merger Consideration

Outstanding Company Common Stock

At the effective time, except as described below, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time (other than (i) shares of Company common stock that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of
record by any subsidiary of the Company and all shares owned of record by Parent, Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, in each
case immediately prior to the effective time and (ii) shares of Company common stock held by stockholders who have not voted in
favor of, or consented to the adoption of, the merger agreement and who have properly demanded appraisal of such shares and
complied in all respects with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of shares to request appraisal of their
shares) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $61.50 in cash, without interest thereon, subject to any
applicable withholding taxes and the following paragraph.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger consideration will be adjusted as follows in the event that the bank
framework agreement is validly terminated, although the merger agreement provides that the merger cannot close until the financial
services business has been sold and the bank framework agreement can

only be terminated in certain circumstances, as described in the section entitled “The Bank Sale Agreements—Termination Rights;
Effect of Termination,” beginning on page 134:
 

 

•  in the event that the bank framework agreement is validly terminated by Synovus in accordance with its terms and the
original bank purchase agreement is automatically deemed to be re-executed in its original form pursuant to the terms
thereof, as further described below, then the merger consideration to be paid by Parent if the closing of the sale of the
financial services business and the closing of the merger occurs will be $62.50 per share in cash, without interest
thereon; and

 

 
•  in the event that the bank framework agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms such that none of

the original bank purchase agreement, the bank framework agreement and the credit card program agreement remains
in effect pursuant to the terms thereof, then either, at the Company’s election,

Company will generally be restricted from entering into an alternative transaction with respect to the
financial services business on terms that are materially less favorable than those of the original bank
purchase agreement and the credit card program agreement, in its original form without giving effect to
any amendments thereto, without Parent’s prior written consent, or

and the closing of the merger occurs will be $62.50 per share in cash, without interest thereon, and the
Company will generally be restricted from entering into an alternative transaction with respect to the
financial services business on terms that are materially less favorable than those of the original bank
purchase agreement and the credit card program agreement, as amended, without Parent’s prior written
consent.

Company-Owned and Parent-Owned Company Common Stock

At the effective time, all shares of Company common stock that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record
by any of the Company’s subsidiaries and all shares of Company common stock owned of record by Parent, Sub or any of their
respective subsidiaries will be cancelled and will cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

Sub Capital Stock

At the effective time, each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Sub will be automatically converted into and
become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving
corporation.

Dissenting Shares

All Company common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and held by a person who
did not vote in favor of or consent to the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly demanded appraisal of such shares and
complied in all respects with all the applicable provisions of the DGCL (which we refer to as “dissenting shares”) will not be
converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, but will be converted into the right to receive fair value of such shares as
determined pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such dissenting stockholder withdraws its demand for
appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses or waives its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, its shares will be
deemed to be converted as of the effective time into the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest.

Table of Contents

The merger agreement provides that the Company will give Parent prompt written notice of any demands or written threats
for appraisal of shares of Company common stock received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands or threats and any other
documents received by the Company in respect thereof (including instruments served on the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL), and Parent will have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands,
threats or documents. The Company will not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands or threats or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards and Equity Plans

Company Options

The merger agreement provides that, as of immediately prior to the effective time and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, each Company option will be fully vested and cancelled by virtue of the merger and, in exchange therefor,
each holder of any such cancelled Company option will be entitled to receive a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of
(i) the total number of shares of Company common stock subject to such cancelled Company option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if
any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price per share subject to such cancelled Company option, without interest; provided,
however, that (A) any such Company option with respect to which the exercise price per share subject thereto is equal or greater than
the merger consideration will be cancelled in exchange for no consideration and (B) such payments will be reduced by the amount of
any required tax withholdings as contemplated by the merger agreement.

RSU Awards

The merger agreement provides that, as of immediately prior to the effective time and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, each RSU award will be fully vested (with any performance conditions applicable to such RSU award
deemed satisfied in full) and cancelled by virtue of the merger, and each holder of any such cancelled RSU award will be entitled to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company common stock subject to such cancelled RSU
award and (ii) the merger consideration; provided, however, that such payments will be reduced by the amount of any required tax
withholdings as contemplated by the merger agreement.

Company Stock Plans and Stock Purchase Plan

The merger agreement provides that, (a) as of the effective time and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, the Company’s 2004 Stock Plan, the Company’s 2013 Stock Plan, and the inducement grant program established by the
Company will be terminated, and (b) as of immediately prior to the effective time, the Company’s 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
will be terminated.

Exchange Procedures

The merger agreement provides that prior to the effective time, Parent will deposit with a U.S.-based nationally recognized
financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (which we refer to as the “paying agent”), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company common stock, a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the aggregate
merger consideration to which Company stockholders will become entitled in connection with the merger (which we refer to as the
“exchange fund”). In the event the exchange fund will be insufficient to make the payments of the merger consideration (including if
any dissenting shares cease to be dissenting shares), Parent is required to promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds
with the paying agent in an amount sufficient to make such payments.

As promptly as practicable after the effective time and in any event not later than the fifth business day thereafter, Parent is
required to cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate whose

Table of Contents

shares of Company common stock were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration at the effective time pursuant to
the merger agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the paying agent, and will otherwise
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may agree; and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender
of the certificates in exchange for payment of the merger consideration. Upon surrender of any certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) for cancellation to the paying agent, if applicable, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper
form, with respect to such certificates, and such other customary documents and instruments as may be reasonably requested by the
paying agent, the holder of such certificates will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the portion of the aggregate merger
consideration into which the shares formerly represented by such certificates were converted pursuant to the merger agreement, and the
certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company common stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and merger consideration may be issued to a person other than
the person in whose name the certificate so surrendered is registered, if such certificate will be properly endorsed or will otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment will either pay to the paying agent any transfer and other similar
taxes required by reason of the payment of the merger consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the certificate so
surrendered or will establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the paying agent that such taxes either have been paid or are not required
to be paid.

Any holder of non-certificated shares of Company common stock represented by book-entry whose shares were converted
into the right to receive the merger consideration at the effective time pursuant to the merger agreement will not be required to deliver a
certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent to receive the merger consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to the merger agreement (or such other amount paid in respect of dissenting shares pursuant to the merger agreement).
In lieu thereof, each such registered holder of one or more non-certificated shares of Company common stock represented by book-
entry will automatically upon the effective time be entitled to receive, and the surviving corporation will cause the paying agent to pay
and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the effective time (but in no event more than five business days thereafter), the
merger consideration for each non-certificated shares of Company common stock represented by book-entry and such shares will
forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the merger consideration with respect to non-certificated shares of Company common stock
represented by book-entry will only be made to the person in whose name such shares are registered.

No interest will be paid or accrue on any portion of the merger consideration payable in respect of any certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated share of Company common stock represented by book-entry.

YOU SHOULD NOT SEND IN YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) WITH YOUR PROXY CARD. A LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING SHARES OF
COMPANY COMMON STOCK WILL BE MAILED TO STOCKHOLDERS HOLDING CERTIFICATED SHARES OF
COMPANY COMMON STOCK IF THE MERGER IS COMPLETED.

Lost, Stolen and Destroyed Certificates

If any Company stock certificate will have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the marking of an affidavit in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the paying agent and Parent of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the paying agent or the surviving corporation, as applicable, will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate the portion of the aggregate merger consideration into which the shares formerly represented by such certificate were
converted pursuant to the merger agreement. However, the paying agent or Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such merger consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company stock certificate to
provide a bond in a customary amount.

the terms of the merger agreement, a material adverse effect means any change, circumstance, event or effect (each of which , we refer
to as an “effect”) that is having, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate together with all other
effects, a material adverse effect on the business, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole. However, none of the following, and no effect to the extent arising out of or resulting from the
following, will constitute or be taken into account in determining whether there has been a material adverse effect:
 

 

•  the entry into or the announcement or pendency of the merger agreement, the bank sale agreements or the transactions
contemplated thereby or the performance of the merger agreement, the bank sale agreements or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby (other than for purposes of certain representations or warranties contained in
the merger agreement), in each case, including (i) by reason of the identity of Parent, Sub or any of their respective
affiliates, (ii) by reason of any public communication by Parent or any of its affiliates regarding the plans or intentions
of Parent with respect to the conduct of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries following the effective time

employees or regulators;

in the world, including interest rates or exchange rates or any changes therein, or any effect generally affecting any
business or industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate;

foregoing;

Company or any of its subsidiaries to meet any internal or public projections, budgets, guidance, forecasts or
estimates of revenues, earnings or other financial results for any period ending on or after the date of the merger
agreement (it being understood that the exceptions in this clause will not prevent or otherwise affect the underlying
cause of any such change or failure referred to therein (to the extent not otherwise falling within any of the exceptions
provided by the preceding clauses) from being taken into account in determining whether a material adverse effect has
occurred), provided, that this clause will not be construed as implying that the Company is making any representation
or warranty with respect to any internal or public projections, budgets, guidance, forecasts or estimates of revenues,
earnings or other financial results for any period; or

 

 

•  any actions or claims made or brought by any of the current or former stockholders, equityholders or securityholders
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (or on their behalf or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
but in any event only in their capacities as current or former stockholders, equityholders or securityholders of the
Company) challenging the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the merger.

However, with respect to the exceptions described in the second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh and ninth bullets above, such
effects will be taken into account to the extent they materially and disproportionately adversely affect the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, compared to other companies operating primarily in the same industries and geographic locations in which the
Company and its subsidiaries operate.

Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals

The Company has agreed that it will, and will cause its subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and the
Company representatives to, immediately cease and use reasonable best efforts to cause to be terminated any solicitations, discussions
or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect to any competing proposal (as described below). In addition, until
the earlier of the effective time or termination of the merger agreement (if any), the Company has agreed that it will not, and will cause
its subsidiaries not to, and use reasonable best efforts to cause the Company representatives not to, directly or indirectly through
another person:
 

 
•  initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry or the making or submission of any proposal or offer

that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a competing proposal;
 

 

•  furnish any non-public information regarding the Company or any of its subsidiaries to any third person in connection
with or in response to, or afford access to the Company representatives or the books, records or properties of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect to, any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a competing proposal; or

 

 
•  engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third person with

respect to any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to any competing
proposal made by such third person or any of its representatives.

A “competing proposal” is defined in the merger agreement to mean any bona fide proposal or offer from any person or
group relating to:
 

 

•  any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase from the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in a single transaction or a
series of transactions, of (i) assets (including capital stock of the Company’s subsidiaries) representing 15% or more
of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined
by the Board or any committee thereof in good faith) or representing 15% or more of the consolidated net revenues or
consolidated net income of the Company and its subsidiaries, including by means of any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, binding share exchange or similar transaction to
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or (ii) 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Company
common stock;

 

 
•  any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or group owning, directly or

indirectly, 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Company common stock; or

Table of Contents

 

•  any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, binding share exchange or
similar transaction to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party pursuant to which any person or group
(or the stockholders of any person) would own, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the equity securities of the
Company or of the surviving entity in a merger involving the Company or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity.

Notwithstanding the non-solicitation provisions described above, if, at any time following the date of the merger agreement
and prior to the receipt of the Company stockholder approval, (i) the Company receives a written competing proposal from a person
that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions described above, which competing proposal was made on or after the
date of the merger agreement, and (ii) the Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, that such competing proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal
(as described below) and that failure to take the actions described in the subsequent clauses (A) or (B) would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law, then the Company may
(A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries to the person making such competing proposal and its
representatives and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such competing proposal and its
representatives regarding such competing proposal; provided, however, that the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries and
will use reasonably best efforts to cause the Company representatives not to, disclose any non-public information regarding the
Company to such person without the Company first entering into an acceptable confidentiality agreement as defined below with such
person. The Company has agreed that it will promptly (and in any event within 36 hours) provide notice to Parent of the receipt of any
competing proposal, which notice will include, unless the Company is prohibited from doing so pursuant to a contract in effect as of
the date of the merger agreement, the identity of the person or persons making such competing proposal, an unredacted copy of such
competing proposal, if made in writing (or a written summary of the material terms of such competing proposal if not made in writing),
any relevant proposed transaction agreements, a copy of any financing commitments (including redacted fee letters), and, substantially
concurrently with the delivery thereof to the person (or its representatives) making the competing proposal, any information concerning
the Company, the Company’s subsidiaries or their businesses, assets or properties provided or made available to such other person (or
its representatives) by the Company after receipt by the Company of the competing proposal that was not previously provided or made
available to Parent. The Company has agreed to keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of any material change in the terms
and conditions of any such competing proposal.

A “superior proposal” is defined in the merger agreement to mean a written competing proposal (with all percentages in the
definition of “competing proposal” increased to “50%”) that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions described
above and was made by any person on terms that the Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Company’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and considering all financial, legal, financing and other aspects of such
competing proposal (including the financing terms thereof, the conditionality and the timing and likelihood of consummation of such
competing proposal and any changes to the merger agreement that may be proposed by Parent in response to such competing proposal),
(i) is reasonably likely to be consummated and (ii) would be more favorable to the Company’s stockholders from a financial point of
view than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including taking into account any applicable termination fee
described below).

Obligations of the Board with Respect to Its Recommendation

The merger agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions described below, neither the Board nor any committee
thereof will: (i) adopt, authorize or approve or recommend any competing proposal (or publicly propose to recommend any competing
proposal); (ii) withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify or amend, in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation by the Board to
Company stockholders that Company stockholders adopt the merger agreement (which, such recommendation, we refer to as the
“Board

recommendation”) (or publicly propose to take any of the foregoing actions); (iii) if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of
capital stock of the Company that constitutes a competing proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer by the Company’s stockholders (including for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to the
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company’s stockholders, which will constitute a failure to recommend against
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer) within ten business days after commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act (which, any such action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), we refer to as a “Board recommendation
change”); (iv) allow or authorize the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement, arrangement or
understanding to effect any competing proposal with the person that made such competing proposal (other than a confidentiality and
standstill agreement (which we refer to as an “acceptable confidentiality agreement”) that contains confidentiality and standstill
provisions of the relevant person that has made such competing proposal, which provisions are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the letter regarding confidentiality, dated as of February 29, 2016 (which we refer to as the
“confidentiality letter”), by and between the Company and Parent) or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (v) make the provisions of any antitakeover or similar statute or
regulation inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a competing proposal; (vi) terminate, amend, release, modify or knowingly
fail to use reasonable best efforts to enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under, any standstill
agreement entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries in respect of or in contemplation of a competing proposal (provided
that, to the extent the Board determines in good faith after consultation with its legal counsel that failure to provide a limited waiver to
any such standstill agreement solely to permit the counterparty thereto privately to approach the Board regarding a competing proposal
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board to the Company’s stockholders under applicable
law, the Company may provide such limited waiver); or (vii) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.

Notwithstanding the obligations of the Board and its committees described above, at any time prior to the receipt of the
Company stockholder approval, the Board or any committee thereof may make a Board recommendation change (and, if so desired by
the Board or any committee thereof, terminate the merger agreement in order to cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a competing proposal) if and only if: (i)(A) a written competing proposal (that did not result from a breach of the
non-solicitation provisions described above) is made to the Company by a third person and (B) the Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such competing proposal
constitutes a superior proposal and that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Board to the Company’s stockholders under applicable law; (ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the
Company’s intention to make a Board recommendation change or to terminate the merger agreement in order to cause the Company to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the competing proposal at least five days prior to making such Board recommendation
change or termination of the merger agreement (which such notice we refer to as a “notice of recommendation change”), which notice
is required to identify the person making such superior proposal and include an unredacted draft of the definitive agreement to effect
such superior proposal and any financing documents (which may be redacted in a customary manner) relating thereto; (iii) if requested
by Parent, the Company has negotiated in good faith, and directed any applicable Company representatives to negotiate in good faith,
with Parent for at least five days following receipt by Parent of such notice of recommendation change with respect to any changes to
the terms of the merger agreement proposed by Parent in a written offer; and (iv) taking into account any changes to the terms of the
merger agreement agreed to by Parent in a written offer to the Company pursuant to clause (iii) above, the Board or any committee
thereof has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
competing proposal would continue to constitute a superior proposal if such changes agreed to in writing by Parent were to be given
effect. Any amendment to the amount or form of consideration contemplated by such competing proposal or any other material
amendment to the terms of such competing proposal (whether or not in response to any changes proposed by Parent pursuant to clause
(iii) above) will require a new notice of recommendation change and an

additional three day period from the date of such notice during which the terms of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above will apply mutatis
mutandis.

Other than in connection with a competing proposal as described above, nothing in the merger agreement prohibits or
restricts the Board or any committee thereof from withholding, modifying or amending, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Board
recommendation if there is an intervening event (as described below), as a result of which, the Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure of the
Board or any committee thereof to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Board to the Company’s stockholders under applicable law; provided that: (i) the Company gives Parent at least five days advance
written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice will include a reasonably detailed summary of the relevant intervening
event; (ii) the Company will give Parent at least five days following receipt by Parent of such notice to propose revisions to the terms
of the merger agreement (or make another proposal) and will, and will have directed the applicable Company representatives to,
negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, during such five day period; and
(iii) following the end of such five day period, the Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after taking into account
any changes to the terms of the merger agreement offered by Parent in a written offer to the Company pursuant to clause (ii) above and
in consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure of the Board or any committee thereof
to effect a Board recommendation change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board to the
Company’s stockholders under applicable law.

An “intervening event” is defined in the merger agreement to mean any event or development material to the Company and
first occurring or arising after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the Company stockholder approval, to the extent that such
event or development was not known by, or reasonably foreseeable to, the Board prior to the date of the merger agreement. In no event,
however, will the following events or developments constitute an intervening event: (i) the receipt, existence or terms of a competing
proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof; (ii) any events or developments relating to Parent or Sub or any of their
affiliates or financing sources or any competitor of the Company; or (iii) changes in the market price or trading volume of the equity
securities of the Company, any changes in the ratings or the ratings outlook for the Company or any of its subsidiaries by any
applicable rating agency, any changes in any analyst’s recommendations or ratings with respect to the Company (although the
exceptions in this clause (iii) will not prevent or otherwise affect the underlying cause of any such event or development referred to
therein (to the extent not otherwise falling within any of the exceptions provided by clauses (i)  and (ii)) from being taken into account
in determining whether an intervening event has occurred).

Efforts to Complete the Merger

The merger agreement provides that (i) each of Parent and the Company will (and will cause each of its affiliates to) use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (ii) the Company will (and will
cause each of its affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements
(and Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to assist the Company in connection therewith). More specifically, Parent will (and will
cause Sub and each of its affiliates to) and the Company will (and will cause each of its subsidiaries to) use its reasonable best efforts to
(A) obtain all actions or nonactions, consents, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations and orders from governmental authorities or
other persons necessary or advisable in connection with the consummation of the merger, (B) make and not withdraw (without the
other party’s consent) all registrations and filings with any governmental authority or other persons necessary or advisable in
connection with the consummation of the merger, (C) other than with respect to any proceeding under the HSR Act, or any other
competition or antitrust law or under any law applicable to the financial services business (which is addressed below), (1) defend all
lawsuits or other legal, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings to which it or any of its affiliates is a party challenging or
affecting the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger, in each case until the issuance

of a final, non-appealable order with respect to each such lawsuit or proceeding, (2) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or
restraining order which may adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate the merger, in each case until the issuance of a
final, non-appealable order with respect thereto, and (3) seek to resolve any objection or assertion by any governmental authority
challenging the merger agreement or the merger and (D) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary or advisable to
consummate the merger. In addition, neither Parent nor Sub, directly or indirectly, through one or more of their respective affiliates,
will take any action that would reasonably be expected to cause a material delay in the consummation of the merger.

The merger agreement provides that, subject to the penultimate sentence of this paragraph, each of Parent and the Company
will, and will cause each of its respective affiliates to, use its and their reasonable best efforts to take any and all steps necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act or any other antitrust or competition law that may be asserted by any
antitrust or competition governmental authority or any other person so as to enable the merger to be consummated. To that end, the
merger agreement provides that Parent will, and will cause its affiliates to, prior to the outside date, defend through litigation on the
merits any claim asserted in court by any person in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any order that would
prevent or delay the consummation of the merger. If the parties receive a “second request,” each of the parties agreed that it will use
reasonable best efforts to certify compliance with such “second request” as promptly as practicable (and in any event within three
months after receipt thereof) and to produce documents on a rolling basis, and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate during the
entirety of any such “second request” review process. Notwithstanding the obligations described above, neither Parent nor any of its
affiliates will be obligated to consent to any divestiture or other structural or conduct relief in order to obtain clearance from any
governmental authority. Without limiting the generality of the obligations described above, each party agreed that it will:
 

 
•  give the other parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or

legal proceeding by or before any governmental authority with respect to the merger;
 

 
•  keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding;

and
 

 
•  promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from the governmental authorities that are required to

approve the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements, the FTC, the DOJ or any other governmental
authority regarding the merger or the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements, as applicable.

Each party agreed that it will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of the
other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted to any governmental authority in connection with the merger and the transactions contemplated by the bank sale
agreements.

The Company agreed that it will also (and will cause each of its affiliates to) make all filings required by the governmental
authorities that are required to approve the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements or under any law applicable to the
financial services business in connection with the merger agreement and the merger or the bank sale agreements and the transactions
contemplated thereby. Further, (i) each of Parent and the Company agreed that it will, in consultation with the other, use reasonable
best efforts to (and to cause each of its affiliates to) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements and (ii) the Company agreed that it will, in consultation with Parent, use
reasonable best efforts to (and to cause each of its affiliates to) obtain all approvals and consents under any law applicable to the
financial services business that may be required by any governmental authority so as to enable the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements. However, (A) the Company agreed that it will not (and will not permit any of
its affiliates to), without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or

delayed), make any undertaking or commitment if the taking of the required action would result in Parent, Sub, the surviving
corporation or any of their respective affiliates incurring any continuing liability or obligation after the closing of the merger that would
be material to Parent and its affiliates, taken as a whole, following completion of the merger, and (B) the Company will not be required
to make any undertaking, commitment or concession that is not conditioned upon the closing of the merger occurring. The Company
has additionally agreed to use reasonable best efforts to comply in all material respects with all of its covenants and agreements set
forth in the bank sale agreements in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof. The Company has agreed that it
will use reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements on the terms and conditions
described therein and will, and will cause the Company representatives to, keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements. Following the
closing of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements, the Company has agreed that it will (and will cause its
subsidiaries to) take all actions reasonably necessary to surrender any Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance of the
Company or any of the Company’s subsidiaries. In the event the bank sale agreements are terminated, Parent is required to use its
reasonable best efforts to take all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange for the Company an alternative transaction for the sale of the financial services
business, pursuant to a transaction with another third party and on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company and subject to certain
other limitations.

Obligations with Respect to this Proxy Statement and the Special Meeting

The Company agreed to, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of the merger agreement amendment, file
with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement containing the Board recommendation to be sent to the Company stockholders in
connection with the stockholder meeting. Parent is required to cooperate with the Company in the preparation of such proxy statement,
among other things. The parties are required to use their respective reasonable best efforts to have the proxy statement cleared by the
SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing with the SEC.

The Company is further required to, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the proxy statement is cleared by the SEC
for mailing to Company stockholders (and in any event no more than 45 days after such clearance) duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of voting on, among other things, the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Company agreed that the Board would recommend that Company
stockholders adopt the merger agreement, and the Company is required to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from Company
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.

Access to Information

From the date of the merger agreement to the effective time, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Company
agreed that it will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to: (i) provide to Parent and Sub and their respective representatives, and to
the debt financing sources, reasonable access during normal business hours in such a manner as not to interfere with the operation of
any business conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, upon prior written notice to the Company, to the officers,
employees, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and its subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof and
(ii) furnish promptly such information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and its
subsidiaries as Parent or its representatives may reasonably request. However, the Company will not be required to (or to cause any of
its subsidiaries to) afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company believes in good faith that doing so
would: (A) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege; (B) violate any confidentiality obligations of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to any third party or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective contract to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is party; (C) result in a competitor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries receiving information

that is competitively sensitive; or (D) breach, contravene or violate any applicable law (including the HSR Act or any other
competition or antitrust law); provided that if any of the restrictions in the foregoing clauses (A) through (D) above will apply, the
Company will advise Parent of the subject matter of any such information that cannot be disclosed and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including adopting additional specific procedures to protect
the confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable laws.

Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance Information

Pursuant to the merger agreement, from and after the effective time until the sixth anniversary thereof, Parent is obligated to
cause the surviving corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and the Company’s or its applicable subsidiaries’
organizational documents, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former director or officer of the Company or any of the
Company’s subsidiaries and each fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, against (i) all losses,
expenses (include reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of
the next sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at the effective time (and whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time) to the extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or fiduciary under benefit plans prior to the effective time, and (ii) all indemnified liabilities to the extent they are
based on or arise out of or pertain to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the effective time, and including any expenses incurred in enforcing such person’s rights. In the event of any such loss, expense,
claim, damage or liability (whether or not asserted before the effective time), the surviving corporation will promptly pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the indemnified parties promptly after statements therefor are received and
otherwise advance to such indemnified party upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred (provided that
the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by a final and
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to indemnification under the law).

Also, the Company will be permitted to, prior to the effective time (and, if the Company fails to do so, Parent will cause the
surviving corporation to), obtain and fully pay the premium for a “tail” insurance and indemnification policy for a claims reporting
period of six years from and after the effective time for events occurring prior to the effective time that is substantially equivalent to
and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended beneficiaries thereof than the Company’s existing directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policy. However, without the prior written consent of Parent, neither the Company nor Parent will purchase
such a “tail” policy for a premium amount for any one year in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for
coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance. If the Company and the surviving corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
“tail” insurance policy as of the effective time, the surviving corporation will, and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the effective time (and for so long thereafter as any claims
brought before the end of such six year period thereunder are being adjudicated) the D&O insurance in place as of the date of the
merger agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s
existing policies as of the date of the merger agreement, or the surviving corporation will, and Parent will cause the surviving
corporation to, purchase comparable D&O insurance for such six year period (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before
the end of such six year period thereunder are being adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at
least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of the merger agreement, provided that neither Parent
nor the surviving corporation will be required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such D&O insurance to the extent exceeding
300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance and if the premiums of
such insurance coverage with respect to any policy year exceed the tail cap, the surviving corporation will be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the effective time, for a cost not exceeding the tail
cap.

Table of Contents

In addition, for not less than six years following the effective time, Parent and the surviving corporation must maintain
provisions in the organizational documents of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses that are no less favorable than the analogous provisions contained in the organizational
documents of the Company and its subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the effective time. The publicly filed contractual
indemnification rights of the directors and officers of the Company will be assumed by the surviving corporation and will continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms following the effective time.

Employee Benefits

Under the merger agreement, from and after the effective time for a period ending on December 31, 2017, Parent has agreed
to provide, or cause its subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation) to provide, to each employee of the Company and its
subsidiaries who remains employed by Parent and its subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation) following the effective time
with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate provided to such employee immediately
prior to the effective time, (ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity and/or cash commission opportunity (if applicable) that is not less
favorable than the aggregate annual cash bonus opportunity and/or cash commission opportunity (if applicable), with certain limited
exclusions, provided to such employee immediately prior to the effective time, (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance benefits provided under the severance plan, policy or agreement in effect for the benefit of such employee immediately
prior to the effective time, (iv) long-term incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than those provided by Parent
to similarly situated employees of Parent and its subsidiaries (if any) and (v) other compensation and benefits (including retirement and
welfare benefits and paid-time off, but excluding long-term incentive, equity-based or equity-linked compensation) that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the other compensation and benefits provided to such employee immediately prior to the effective
time.

In addition, from and after the effective time, Parent has agreed to assume, honor and continue, or to cause its subsidiaries
(including the surviving corporation) to assume, honor and continue all of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ employment, severance,
retention and termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including any change in control or severance
agreement between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any continuing employee). For all purposes under the employee benefit
plans of Parent and its subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation) (including for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals), Parent has agreed that each continuing employee’s service with or otherwise
credited by the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be treated as service with Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the
surviving corporation) (assuming that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits). Parent has further agreed to, and to
cause its subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation) to, use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any of Parent’s or its
subsidiaries’ (including the surviving corporation’s) welfare benefit plans in which the continuing employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the effective time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
Company’s and its subsidiaries’ comparable employee benefit plan immediately prior to the effective time. Parent has agreed to, or to
cause its subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation) to, use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to be
recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each continuing employee (and his or
her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the effective time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year’s deductible
and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such continuing employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the effective time. Further, if requested by Parent in writing at least 15
business days prior to the effective time, the Company will cause any 401(k) plan of the Company or its subsidiaries to be terminated
effective as of the day immediately prior to the effective time and, effective as soon as practicable following the effective time, the
continuing employees will be eligible to participate in and make applicable rollover contributions of “eligible rollover

Financing

The consummation of the merger is not conditioned upon Parent’s or Sub’s receipt of financing. However, under the merger
agreement, Parent and Sub are obligated to use their reasonable best efforts to arrange the financing on the terms and conditions
described in the debt commitment letter and preferred financing commitment letter. If any portion of the debt financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the debt commitment letter, Parent and Sub are obligated to use their
reasonable best efforts to arrange for and obtain any such portion from alternative sources on comparable or more favorable terms (in
respect of certainty of funding) to Parent as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent and Sub will not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the debt commitment letter or
preferred financing commitment letter without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), other than such amendments, modifications or waivers that would not (and would not be reasonably expected to) reduce
the aggregate financing available to consummate the merger, impose additional conditions to the financing, delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, adversely impact the likelihood of the quality of the
financing or the ability of Parent or Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties thereto or timely consummate the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

Subject to certain exceptions, on or prior to the closing, the Company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide to Parent and Sub, and cause each of its subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and instruct its
representatives to provide, at Parent’s sole expense, customary cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
arrangement of the debt financing or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing. Parent has agreed to
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation, and to indemnify the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective representatives
against losses incurred in connection with the debt financing and any information used in connection therewith (other than historical
information provided in writing by the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective representatives specifically for use in connection
therewith).

Other Covenants and Agreements

Under the merger agreement, the Company and Parent have made certain other covenants to and agreements with each other
regarding various other matters, including:
 

 •  preparation of this proxy statement;
 

 •  the operation of the transition team for the bank sale transactions;
 

 •  operating activities of Sub during the period from the date of the merger agreement to the effective time;
 

 
•  public statements and disclosure concerning the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger

agreement;
 

 •  state anti-takeover or other similar laws;
 

 

•  the Company’s ability to take all actions as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that the dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) by any officer or director of the Company who is
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act pursuant to the merger are exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act; and

 

 
•  control of the defense of litigation brought by Company stockholders against the Company or its directors or officers

arising out of or relating to the merger.

•  the Company terminates the merger agreement as described in the third bullet in the section entitled “—Termination

of the Merger Agreement—Termination Rights Exercisable by the Company,” above.

While the Company termination fee and the Parent termination fee are generally the parties’ sole and exclusive remedies
under the merger agreement in the event of their respective payment, the Company is entitled to pursue one or more claims for
damages against Parent in an aggregate amount of up to $115,000,000 (in addition to the Parent termination fee) in the event of a
willful and material breach by Parent or Sub of their obligations relating to obtaining clearance of the merger under the HSR Act or
other competition or antitrust laws described above.

For information regarding amounts payable by the Company and WFB to Capital One in the event that the bank sale
agreements are terminated under certain specified circumstances (including in certain specified circumstances after the merger
agreement is terminated), see the section entitled “The Bank Sale Agreements—Termination Rights; Effect of Termination,” beginning
on page 134.

Miscellaneous

Specific Performance

The parties are entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the merger agreement, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under the merger agreement. However, the Company is only entitled to specific performance of
Parent’s obligations to cause the preferred equity financing to be funded and to consummate the merger in the event that each of the
following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the applicable conditions to the merger have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of
such conditions); (ii) Parent fails to complete the closing of the merger on the date the closing of the merger should have occurred in
accordance with the merger agreement; (iii) the debt financing has been funded or will be funded at the closing of the merger if the
equity financing is funded at the closing of the merger; and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that the
closing of the merger will occur if specific performance is granted and the debt financing and the equity financing is funded.

Guaranty

Pursuant to the merger agreement, Parent has guaranteed the due, prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge
by Sub of, and the compliance by Sub with, all of the covenants, agreements, obligations and undertakings of Sub under the merger
agreement. Parent has further agreed to take all actions necessary or advisable to ensure such payment, performance and discharge by
Sub under the merger agreement.

Amendment of the Merger Agreement

Except in certain circumstances with respect to certain provisions to which the debt financing sources are third party
beneficiaries, the merger agreement may be further amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of the Company
stockholder approval by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. However, after receipt of the Company
stockholder approval, there may not be any amendment of the merger agreement that decreases the merger consideration or that
adversely affects the rights of the Company stockholders under the merger agreement without the approval of the Company
stockholders at a duly convened meeting of the Company stockholders called to obtain approval of such amendment.

Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury

The merger agreement is governed by Delaware law. Each of the parties has irrevocably agreed that any legal action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to the merger agreement brought by any other party or its

successors or assigns will be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State
of Delaware (unless such court will decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or
federal court within the State of Delaware). Notwithstanding the foregoing, actions against the financing sources must generally be
brought exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof). In addition, each of the parties to the merger agreement has irrevocably and unconditionally waived any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the merger agreement or the merger.

THE BANK SALE AGREEMENTS

In connection with the merger agreement amendment, on April 17, 2017, the Company entered into (i) the bank framework
agreement with WFB, Synovus, Capital One and, solely for the purposes set forth therein, CONA, (ii) the Synovus bank asset purchase
agreement with WFB and Synovus and (iii) the Capital One bank asset purchase agreement with WFB and Capital One. These
agreements, together with the third party bank asset purchase agreement between Synovus and Capital One, provide for, in connection
with the closing of the merger, the sale the financial services business, including the credit card program currently operated by the
Company and WFB and certain related liabilities, as further described below. Such bank sale agreements amended and restated the
original bank purchase agreement among the Company, WFB and CONA, which similarly provided for the sale of the financial
services business, with Synovus acceding as a party thereto and Capital One novated for CONA as a party thereto. You are not being
asked to vote on or adopt any of the bank sale agreements.

Pursuant to the bank sale agreements, by way of three transactions, (i) Synovus has agreed to acquire assets and assume
liabilities of WFB, which collectively constitute substantially all of the financial services business (which we refer to as the “Synovus
bank asset sale”), (ii) Capital One has agreed to acquire certain other assets and assume certain other liabilities of WFB (which we
refer to as the “Capital One bank asset sale” and, together with the Synovus bank asset sale, the “initial bank asset sales”) and
(iii) immediately following the consummation of the Synovus bank asset sale, Synovus has agreed to sell and assign to Capital One,
and Capital One has agreed to acquire and assume, certain of such assets and liabilities acquired and assumed by Synovus from WFB,
such that Synovus retains all deposits of WFB and certain other assets and liabilities relating to deposits of WFB and Capital One
acquires the assets and liabilities relating to the credit card program and equity interests in certain securitization funding vehicles
(which we refer to as the “final bank asset sale”).

The bank sale agreements are described in this proxy statement only to provide you with information regarding certain of
their terms and conditions and not to provide any other factual information regarding the Company, WFB, Synovus, Capital One or
CONA or their respective businesses. In the case of the Company, such information can be found in the public filings that the Company
makes with the SEC, which are available without charge through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. See the section entitled “Where
You Can Find More Information,” on page 153.

The representations, warranties and covenants made in the bank sale agreements by the Company, WFB, Synovus and
Capital One are qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by the Company, WFB, Synovus, Capital One and CONA in
connection with negotiating the terms of the bank sale agreements.

Holders of Company common stock are not being asked to adopt or approve the bank sale agreements or the related credit
card program agreement, dated as of October 3, 2016 and as amended from time to time (which we refer to as the “credit card
program agreement”), by and between the Company and Capital One, specifying the obligations of the Company and Capital One
regarding the establishment and operation of the Cabela’s co-branded credit card program that will be effective upon the closing of the
transactions described in the bank sale agreements, or in either case the transactions contemplated thereby. The amount of the merger
consideration to be received for each share of Company common stock in the merger is not dependent on the proceeds contemplated by
the bank sale agreements; provided, however, that the amount of the merger consideration is subject to adjustment if the bank
framework agreement is validly terminated (although the merger agreement provides that the merger cannot close until the financial
services business has been sold and the bank framework agreement can only be terminated in certain circumstances).

Pursuant to the merger agreement, the obligations of Parent, Sub and the Company to consummate the merger are
conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements or an alternative transaction and the
subsequent merger of WFB into the Company or another of its subsidiaries and the termination of its banking charter, which merger
and termination of the banking charter are only contemplated to occur following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the bank sale agreements, including the

transfer of the bank deposits held by WFB to Synovus. Pursuant to the bank sale agreements, as further described below, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements is conditioned on, among other things, the satisfaction of
certain of the conditions to the consummation of the merger set forth in the merger agreement and the receipt by each of the Company
and Capital One of irrevocable letters from the parties to the merger agreement stating that such parties are ready, willing and able to
consummate the merger immediately following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements. As a
result, the closing of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements and the establishment of the credit card program
contemplated by the credit card program agreement are contemplated to take effect only in connection with the closing of the merger.

Set forth below is a summary of the closing conditions, termination rights, covenants and certain other provisions of the
bank sale agreements.

For more information regarding the bank sale agreements, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 
18, 2017 and Exhibits 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 thereto, which are incorporated by reference herein.

Closing Conditions

The respective obligations of the Company, WFB, Synovus and Capital One under the bank sale agreements to consummate
the initial bank asset sales contemplated thereby are subject to the satisfaction or written waiver by such parties of the following
conditions as of the closing of such transactions:
 

 

•  the receipt and provision by the parties to the bank sale agreements of the following approvals and consents from and
notices to governmental authorities: (i) approval of the FRB of a BMA application filed by Synovus with respect to
the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements and expiration of any related required post-approval
waiting period; and (ii) notice to the Nebraska Department of Banking & Finance of the transactions contemplated by
the bank sale agreements;

 

 
•  the absence of any order by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction that remains in effect prohibiting or

making illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the bank framework agreement or the credit
card program agreement; and

 

 

•  with respect to the Company, WFB and Capital One, (i) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the
consummation of the merger set forth in the merger agreement (other than (A) such conditions addressing the
consummation of the purchase and sale of the assets acquired pursuant to the bank framework agreement, (B) such
conditions addressing the dissolution or liquidation of WFB or the termination of its banking charter and (C) such
other conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but in each case subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), (ii) the receipt by the Company and Capital One of irrevocable letters from
the parties to the merger agreement stating that such parties are ready, willing and able to consummate the merger
immediately following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements and (iii) the
credit card program agreement remaining in effect as of the closing date.

The credit card program agreement will automatically terminate if the bank sale agreements terminate prior to the closing of
the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements and may be terminated by Capital One before the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the bank sale agreements in the event of certain uncured breaches of the Company’s obligations under the credit card
program agreement if such breaches (other than failures in violation of applicable law) have a material and adverse effect on the credit
card program contemplated thereby or related licensed intellectual property or materially diminish the economic value of the credit
card program to Capital One. The Company’s pre-closing obligations under the credit card program agreement generally require the
Company to take actions to facilitate the establishment of the credit card program at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the
bank sale agreements.

bank asset sales will automatically be deemed to be rescinded and not to have taken place, which will include the return of any cash
amounts paid and any assets and liabilities transferred thereby.

Termination Rights; Effect of Termination

The bank sale agreements may be terminated prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale
agreements by mutual written consent of Capital One, Synovus and the Company. The bank sale agreements may also be terminated
prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements by Capital One, Synovus or the Company:
 

 

•  in the event of a breach or default in the performance by Capital One (in the case of a termination by Synovus or the
Company), by Synovus (in the case of a termination by Capital One or the Company) or by the Company or WFB (in
the case of a termination by Capital One or Synovus) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the
bank framework agreement, which such breach or default (i) would, individually or in the aggregate with all other
uncured breaches and defaults of such party, constitute grounds for certain conditions of closing applicable to the

terminating party not to be satisfied at the closing, and (ii) has not been, or cannot be, cured within 30 days after
written notice given by the terminating party to the breaching or defaulting party (or, if earlier, the outside date);
provided, however, that neither Capital One, Synovus nor the Company is permitted to terminate the bank sale
agreements pursuant to the foregoing if such terminating party has breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the bank framework agreement such that certain of
the conditions of closing would not be satisfied; and

 

 

•  if the closing of the initial bank asset sales contemplated by the bank sale agreements has not occurred on or before
the outside date; provided, however, that neither Capital One, Synovus nor the Company is permitted to terminate the
bank sale agreements pursuant to the foregoing if such terminating party has breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the bank framework agreement such that certain of
its conditions of closing would not be satisfied.

The bank sale agreements may also be terminated prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale
agreements by either Capital One or the Company:
 

 •  if the merger agreement or the credit card program agreement has been terminated; and
 

 

•  if any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has issued, enacted or entered any order, injunction or decree
permanently enjoining, restraining or prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the bank framework agreement,
and such order has become final and non-appealable; provided, that neither Capital One nor the Company is permitted
to terminate the bank sale agreements pursuant to the foregoing if such terminating party has failed in any material
respect to comply with its obligations under the bank framework agreement to use reasonable best efforts to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the bank framework agreement.

The bank sale agreements may also be terminated prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale
agreements by the Company within ten days after any date on which (i) Synovus validly withdraws any required registration or filing
made with a governmental agency in connection with the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements if, after submission
thereof, such governmental authority has requested such withdrawal or informed Synovus that such registration or filing will be denied
if not withdrawn or (ii) the FRB or the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance issues a final written denial of any required
approval of or consent to the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements therefrom.

In the event that Synovus validly terminates the bank sale agreements in accordance with their terms, then the original bank
purchase agreement (in the form executed on October 3, 2016) would automatically be deemed to be re-executed and again in full force
and effect, unless either Capital One or the Company elects otherwise in writing within five business days and is not then in breach of
default in the performance of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the bank framework agreement, which such
breach or default would constitute grounds for certain conditions of closing applicable to such party not to be satisfied at the closing.
For more information regarding the original bank purchase agreement, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on
October 7, 2016 and Exhibit 2.2 thereto. However, in the event that either Capital One or the Company validly terminates the bank sale
agreements in accordance with their terms, both the original bank purchase agreement and the bank sale agreements would remain void
and of no further force or effect; provided that nothing relieves any party from liability arising out of fraud or willful or intentional
breach of either agreement.

In addition, in the event that:
 

 
•  (i) the bank sale agreements are terminated by (A) any party because the closing of the initial bank asset sales

contemplated by the bank sale agreements has not occurred by the outside date and at the time of such termination all

such bank sale agreements have been satisfied or waived (other than those relating to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the dissolution or liquidation of WFB and the termination of
its banking charter, and other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the initial
bank asset sales contemplated by the bank sale agreements, but in each case would be capable of being satisfied if the
date of such closing were the date of such termination), (B) either Capital One or the Company because the merger
agreement has been terminated or (C) either Capital One or Synovus because of a breach or default in the
performance by the Company or WFB of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the bank framework
agreement, which such breach or default (1) would, individually or in the aggregate with all other uncured breaches
and defaults of such party, constitute grounds for certain conditions of closing applicable to Capital One, Synovus or
the Company and WFB, as the case may be, not to be satisfied at the closing and (2) has not been, or cannot be, cured
within 30 days after written notice given by the terminating party to the breaching or defaulting party (or, if earlier,
the outside date); and

 

 
•  (ii) the merger agreement is also terminated under circumstances where the Company termination fee is payable by

the Company to Parent pursuant to the merger agreement;

then Capital One will be entitled to receive from the Company a termination fee of $14,000,000 (which we refer to as the “Capital One
fixed termination fee”). In the event that the bank sale agreements are terminated in any of the circumstances referred to in clause (i) of
the immediately preceding sentence, the Company and Parent mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement and, in connection
with such termination of the merger agreement, Parent receives any payment or fee from the Company (whether pursuant to the terms
of the merger agreement or otherwise), Capital One will be entitled to receive from the Company a termination fee of 10% of the
aggregate payment or fee received by Parent from the Company (which we refer to as the “Capital One variable termination fee”). No
termination fee will be payable if Capital One is participating as a bank partner in a competing proposal.

Further, in the event that, in certain circumstances, the bank sale agreements are terminated by Parent, Synovus or Capital
One other than in the event of certain breaches or defaults by Synovus, then Synovus will be entitled to receive from Capital One a
termination fee of $10,000,000, subject to certain exceptions, plus reimbursement of certain costs and expenses (which we refer to as
the “Synovus termination fee”). However, WFB is obligated to reimburse Capital One for up to $10,000,000 of the Synovus
termination fee paid to Synovus in the event that:
 

 •  (i) Capital One is not entitled to the Capital One fixed termination fee; and
 

 

•  (ii) the bank sale agreements are terminated by (A) Capital One or Synovus because of a breach or default by the
Company or WFB of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the bank framework agreement, which
such breach or default (1) would, individually or in the aggregate with all other uncured breaches and defaults of such
party, constitute grounds for certain conditions of closing not to be satisfied at the closing and (2) has not been, or
cannot be, cured within 30 days after written notice given by the terminating party to the breaching or defaulting party
(or, if earlier, the outside date), (B) Capital One or the Company because the merger agreement is also terminated
under circumstances where the board of directors changed its recommendation with respect to the merger, among
other things, (C) Capital One because the credit card program agreement is also terminated under circumstances
where a Company event of default has occurred under the credit card program agreement and the conditions to the
closing of the transactions contemplated by such bank sale agreements applicable to Capital One, Parent and Seller
have been satisfied or waived, subject to certain exceptions, (D) Capital One because the merger agreement is also
terminated under circumstances where a governmental authority has issued or entered a final, non-appealable order
permanently enjoining, restraining or prohibiting the merger or of a breach or failure to perform by the Company of
any representation, warranty,

covenant or agreement in the merger agreement, which such breach or failure (1) would constitute grounds for certain
conditions of closing of the merger not to be satisfied at the closing of the merger and (2) is not capable of cure or has
not been cured within 30 days after written notice given by Parent to the Company, and the conditions to the closing
of the transactions contemplated by such bank sale agreements applicable to Capital One, Parent and Seller have been

contemplated by the bank sale agreements has not occurred by the outside date and at the time of such termination
certain of the conditions to the closing of the transactions contemplated by such bank sale agreements have not been
satisfied or waived.

Efforts to Complete the Transactions Contemplated by the Bank Sale Agreements

The bank framework agreement provides that each of the Company, WFB, Capital One and Synovus will (and will cause
each of its affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements and to
cause the conditions set forth in the bank sale agreements to be satisfied, subject to certain exceptions described below. The bank
framework agreement further provides that, subject to certain exceptions described below, Synovus will (and will cause its affiliates
to), and each of the Company, WFB and Capital One will (and will cause each of its affiliates to), use its reasonable best efforts to:
(i) as promptly as practicable obtain certain approvals required by the bank framework agreement; (ii) make and not withdraw (without
the other parties’ consent) all registrations and filings necessary or advisable in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the bank sale agreements; (iii) defend all lawsuits or other proceedings to which it is a party, challenging or affecting
the bank sale agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby; (iv) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining
order which may adversely affect the abilities of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements;
and (v) seek to resolve any objection by any governmental authority challenging the bank sale agreements or the transactions
contemplated thereby, other than with respect to certain required regulatory approvals. Under the bank framework agreement, none of
the Company, WFB, Capital One or Synovus will, directly or indirectly, take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent
or cause a material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the bank sale agreements or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements or, in the case of the Company and WFB, by the merger agreement (in the case
of the Company and WFB, other than exercising any right under the merger agreement to terminate the merger agreement in
accordance with its terms).

The bank framework agreement also provides that, in furtherance of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the bank sale agreements and subject to as otherwise described below, each of the Company and WFB will (and will cause each of its
affiliates to) take (or not take, as the case may be) the following actions:
 

 
•  use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to cause the

conditions set forth in the merger agreement to be satisfied;
 

 

•  with respect to WFB, make any undertakings requested by Synovus and required to obtain required regulatory
approvals and consents of certain governmental authorities or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or
vacate or lift, any order that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements; and

 

 
•  take all actions reasonably necessary to obtain any and all consents and approvals necessary under the securitization

documents to consummate the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements, such related agreements and
the merger agreement.

The bank framework agreement also provides that, in furtherance of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the bank sale agreements and subject to as otherwise described below, Synovus will

(and will cause each of its affiliates to) take all actions necessary or advisable to obtain required regulatory approvals and consents of
certain governmental authorities and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the bank sale agreements in connection with obtaining such required regulatory approvals and consents of certain
governmental authorities.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, under the bank sale agreements:
 

 

•  Capital One and its affiliates are not obligated to take, and the Company and WFB and their affiliates are not
permitted to take or refrain from taking (without Capital One’s prior written consent), any action in connection with
obtaining approvals or consents under any laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by the bank sale
agreements that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local governmental authority or obtaining
consents and approvals necessary under WFB’s securitization documents that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, operations, results of operations or financial
condition of Capital One and its affiliates (measured on a scale relative to the assets to be acquired by Capital One
under the bank sale agreements, the liabilities to be assumed by Capital One under the bank sale agreements and the
credit card program, taken as a whole); provided, however, that Capital One will negotiate in good faith with the
relevant governmental authority to seek a commercially reasonable modification to any prohibition, limitation or other
requirement to reduce the burdensome nature thereof such that such prohibition, limitation or other requirement no
longer constitutes such a burdensome condition;

 

 

•  Synovus and its affiliates are not obligated to take, and the Company and WFB and their affiliates are not permitted to
take or refrain from taking (without Synovus’ prior written consent), any action in connection with obtaining
approvals or consents under any laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements
that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local governmental authority or obtaining consents and
approvals necessary under WFB’s securitization documents that would reasonably be expected to (i) materially impair
or materially and negatively affect (a) the business, operations, results of operations, financial condition or assets and
liabilities of Synovus and its affiliates (taken as a whole), (b) Synovus’ ability to own, maintain or service WFB’s
deposits and certain other assets relating to WFB’s deposits in a manner that is materially adverse to Synovus or
(c) Synovus’ ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements, (ii) compel Synovus
or its affiliates to dispose of all or any material portion of WFB’s deposits or their other assets or liabilities in a way
that would be materially adverse to Synovus or (iii) obligate Synovus to take any action required by the FRB if such
action (together with all other actions Synovus is required by the FRB to take) would result in Synovus incurring
out-of-pocket costs and expenses, not including certain out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred with respect to
professional or advisory services or that are otherwise reimbursed or indemnified, in excess of $22,500,000 in the
aggregate; provided, however, that Synovus will negotiate in good faith with the relevant governmental authority to
seek a commercially reasonable modification to any prohibition, limitation or other requirement to reduce the
burdensome nature thereof such that such prohibition, limitation or other requirement no longer constitutes such a
burdensome condition and will cooperate in good faith with the Company, WFB and Capital One to avoid the
occurrence of such a burdensome condition; and

 

 
•  Synovus may withdraw any required registration or filing made with a governmental agency in connection with the

transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements if, after submission thereof, such governmental authority has
requested such withdrawal or informed Synovus that such registration or filing will be denied if not withdrawn.

Other Covenants

Under the bank sale agreements, each of the Company, WFB, Capital One and Synovus has also agreed to take (or not to
take, as the case may be) certain other actions. Such actions include the following:
 

 •  the delivery of certain closing deliverables described in the bank sale agreements;
 

 
•  the delivery by WFB to Capital One of the valuation statement, accountholder master file and other books and records

described in the bank sale agreements;
 

 •  the assumption of certain tax obligations;
 

 •  the facilitation of any remediation or compliance actions;
 

 •  the preservation of and access to certain records;
 

 •  the use of reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents;
 

 •  the release of certain claims of Synovus; and
 

 •  certain indemnification obligations.

The bank framework agreement also contains certain interim operating covenants that address the manner in which the
Company and WFB will conduct their respective businesses through the closing of the transactions contemplated in the bank sale
agreements. Among other things, the interim operating covenants provide that the Company and WFB, subject to certain exceptions,
will (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact and maintain the existing relations and goodwill with customers,
employees, partners, accountholders, vendors, suppliers, regulators, licensors and licensees and other third parties relating to the credit
card program, (ii) conduct the credit card program in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and in accordance with WFB’s policies and procedures and (iii) not implement any changes to the terms and conditions
contained in the credit card agreement, except for ordinary course modifications and those required by or to conform with applicable
law. In addition, prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the bank sale agreements, (A) WFB is required to settle certain
accountholder credit balances and refund or settle certain deposits and (B) all new deposits originated by WFB are generally required
to be redeemable for principal and outstanding interest. Furthermore, the Company and WFB have agreed to develop a transition team,
undertake certain transitional matters and enter into a transitional servicing agreement and a lease agreement with Capital One in order
to facilitate the transition of the Company’s and WFB’s credit card program and operations relating thereto to Capital One.

The bank framework agreement additionally contains covenants of the Company and WFB that prohibit the solicitation of
any potential sale or transaction, other than with Capital One and, with respect to the transactions contemplated by the bank sale
agreements, Synovus, related to the financial services business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, nothing in the bank sale
agreements will affect any rights of the Company with respect to any competing proposal under certain sections of the merger
agreement, including the Company’s right to provide competing proposal information and participate in discussions with the person
making any competing proposal, in all cases subject to, in compliance with and solely to the extent permitted under, the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement.

THE VOTING AGREEMENTS

In connection with the merger agreement, each of the directors of the Company, who collectively beneficially owned an
aggregate of 13,261,189 shares of Company common stock as of October 3, 2016, representing approximately 18.52% of the shares of
Company common stock outstanding as of that date, entered into a voting agreement with Parent, Sub, and the Company, pursuant to
which each of the directors agreed, among other things, to vote in favor of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and to vote against (i) any proposal that would impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify any provision of the merger
agreement or the merger, result in a breach of any covenant, representation, warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Company
under the merger agreement, result in any of the conditions to the closing of the merger set forth in the merger agreement not being
fulfilled or change in any manner the dividend policy or capitalization of, including the voting rights of, any class of capital stock of
the Company, (ii) any competing proposal to the merger or any proposal related to such a competing proposal, (iii) any merger
agreement or merger (other than the merger agreement and the merger), consolidation, combination, sale of substantial assets,
reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or by the Company or (iv) any change in the business,
management or board of the Company (other than in connection with the merger), subject to certain limited exceptions. These voting
commitments do not apply during any period in which the Company’s board of directors has withheld, withdrawn, modified, qualified
or amended its recommendation in favor of the merger agreement and the merger in response to a superior proposal or an intervening
event in accordance with the merger agreement (although to the extent that the Company’s board of directors reinstates its
recommendation of the merger agreement and the merger, the commitments again apply).

Under the voting agreements, each director waived and may not exercise any appraisal rights or rights to dissent with
respect to his or her shares of Company common stock in connection with the merger. During the term of the voting agreements, the
directors are obligated to abide by the restrictions on solicitation set forth in the merger agreement. In addition, under the voting
agreements, a director is not permitted to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, assign, gift, hedge or pledge any of his or shares of
Company common stock or any interests therein, permit any of his or her shares of Company common stock to become subject to any
lien or grant any power of attorney or proxy in respect of any of his or her shares of Company common stock, among other things and
subject to certain limited exceptions. However, following approval by the stockholders of the adoption of the merger agreement, the
directors may, without restriction, sell, transfer, assign, gift, hedge or pledge any of his or her shares of Company common stock,
subject to the stock ownership compliance program and other policies of the Company. The voting agreements will terminate upon the
earlier of (i) the completion of the merger, (ii) the termination of the merger agreement or (iii) the reduction of the consideration
payable in connection with the merger if, in the case of clause (iii), the applicable director has abstained from voting on or voted
against such matter in his or her capacity as a director of the Company. Because each director of the Company voted in favor of the
approval of the merger agreement amendment in his or her capacity as a director, each director’s voting agreement was unaffected by
the merger agreement amendment.

The voting agreements are executed by each of these directors in an individual capacity as a stockholder and do not limit or
restrict such signatory thereto from acting in his or her capacity as a director in such person’s discretion on any matter. A copy of the
form of voting agreement executed by all directors other than James W. Cabela and Dennis Highby is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement. Forms of the voting agreements executed by James W. Cabela and Dennis Highby are attached as Annex C and Annex D,
respectively. The foregoing summary of the voting agreements is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of
the forms of the voting agreements attached as Annex B, Annex C and Annex D to this proxy statement and incorporated herein by
reference.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

Under Delaware law, holders of shares of Company common stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the
merger, provided that such holders meet all of the conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If the merger is completed, holders
of record of shares of Company common stock who continuously hold shares through the effective time who did not vote in favor of
the merger and who otherwise complied with the applicable statutory procedures under Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to
appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is
qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex F. All
references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to the record holder of shares of Company common
stock as to which appraisal rights are asserted. A person having a beneficial interest in shares held of record in the name of another
person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and
in a timely manner to demand and perfect appraisal rights. Stockholders should carefully review the full text of Section 262 of the
DGCL as well as the information discussed below.

Under the DGCL, if the merger is effected, holders of shares of Company common stock who (i) did not cast their vote in
favor of the merger, (ii) follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and (iii) do not thereafter properly withdraw their
demand for appraisal of such shares or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case, in accordance with the DGCL, will be entitled
to have such shares appraised by the Court of Chancery and to receive payment of the “fair value” of such shares, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined by such court, together with interest, if
any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. The “fair value” could be greater than, less than or the same as the
merger consideration of $61.50 per share.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, the Company is required not less than 20 days before the special meeting to vote on the
merger to notify each of the holders of Company common stock who are entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available
for any or all of such shares, and is required to include in such notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement
constitutes a formal notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Any holder of shares of Company common stock
who wishes to exercise such appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review the following
discussion and Annex F carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures specified may result in the loss of
appraisal rights under the DGCL.

Any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights should consider consulting legal counsel before attempting to
exercise such rights.

If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you should carefully review the text of Section 262 of the DGCL set forth in
Annex F to this proxy statement and consider consulting your legal advisor. If you fail to timely and properly comply with the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, your appraisal rights may be lost. To exercise appraisal rights with respect to your shares of
Company common stock, you must:
 

 •  NOT vote your shares of Company common stock in favor of the merger;
 

 
•  deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the taking of the vote on the proposal to

adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting, as described further below under “—Written Demand by the
Record Holder;”

 

 •  continuously hold your shares of Company common stock through the effective time; and
 

 •  otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.

Table of Contents

Written Demand by the Record Holder

All written demands for appraisal should be addressed to Cabela’s Incorporated, One Cabela Drive, Sidney, Nebraska,
69160, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the Company of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Under Section 262 of the
DGCL, a proxy or vote against the merger does not constitute such a demand.

The written demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the record holder of shares, fully and correctly, as such holder’s
name appears on the stock records of the Company. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,
guardian or custodian, execution of the demand must be made in that capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one
person, such as in a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized
agent, including one of two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record. However, the
agent must identify the record owner(s) and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for
the record owner(s).

A beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock held in “street name” who wishes to exercise appraisal rights
should take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the record holder of
the shares. If the shares are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee who in turn holds the shares through a central
securities depository nominee, such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the
depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as the record stockholder. Any beneficial owner who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights and holds shares through a nominee holder is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by
the record stockholder. The beneficial holder of the shares should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for appraisal should be
made by the record holder of the shares, which may be a central securities depository nominee if the shares have been so deposited.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

Within 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation (which, in this case, will be the
Company), or any holder of shares of Company common stock who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery, with a copy
served on the Company in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held
by all holders who did not adopt the merger and properly demanded appraisal of such shares. If no such petition is filed within that
120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all dissenting stockholders. The Company is under no obligation to, and has no present
intention to, file a petition, and holders should not assume that the Company will file a petition or that it will initiate any negotiations
with respect to the fair value of shares of Company common stock. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the holders of shares of
Company common stock to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of the shares within the period
prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

Within 120 days after the effective time, any holder of shares of Company common stock who has complied with the
requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a
statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal
have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within ten days after a written
request therefor has been received by the surviving corporation or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of
demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the requirement that a demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf
of the record owner of shares, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of
such person, and as to which demand has been properly made and not effectively

withdrawn, may, in such person’s own name, file a petition for appraisal or request from the surviving corporation the statement
described in this paragraph.

Upon the filing of such petition by any such holder of shares, service of a copy thereof must be made upon the surviving
corporation, which will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Register in Chancery of the Court of
Chancery (which we refer to as the “Delaware Register in Chancery”) a duly verified list (which we refer to as the “verified list”)
containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to
the value of their shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Court of Chancery may order the Delaware
Register in Chancery to provide notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the surviving corporation
and all of the stockholders shown on the verified list. Such notice will also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing
in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or in another publication determined by the Court
of Chancery. The costs of these notices are borne by the surviving corporation.

After notice to the stockholders as required by the Court of Chancery, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a
hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become
entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares of
Company common stock and who hold shares represented by certificates to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in
Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceeding, and, if any such stockholder fails to comply with the
direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder. Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, assuming
that immediately prior to the merger shares of Company common stock continue to be listed on the NYSE, the Court of Chancery will
dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all holders of shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of
shares entitled to appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock eligible for appraisal, or (ii) the
value of the merger consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1,000,000.

Determination of Fair Value

After the Court of Chancery determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.
Through the appraisal proceeding, the Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to
be the fair value. Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as otherwise
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, interest from the effective time through the date of payment of the judgment will be
compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time
to time during the period between the effective time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment
in the proceedings, the Company may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall
accrue thereafter as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid
and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.

In determining fair value, the Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating
that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court” should be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the
value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Court of Chancery must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and

Table of Contents

any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation.
Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger[.]” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow
exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value
arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future
value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product
of speculation, may be considered.”

Stockholders considering appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Company common stock as so
determined could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration of $61.50 per share and that an investment banking
opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the merger, is not an
opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, “fair value” under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although the Company believes that the
merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Court of
Chancery. Neither Parent nor the Company anticipates offering more than the merger consideration to any stockholder exercising
appraisal rights, and Parent and the Company reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262
of the DGCL, the fair value of a share of Company common stock is less than the merger consideration.

Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any holder of shares of Company common stock entitled to participate
in the appraisal proceeding, the Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final
determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any holder of shares of Company common stock whose name appears on the
verified list and, if such shares are represented by certificates and if so required, who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of
stock to the Delaware Register in Chancery, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder
is not entitled to appraisal rights. The Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares of Company common
stock, together with interest, if any, by the surviving corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each
such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock, forthwith, and, in the case of holders of shares represented by
certificates, upon the surrender to the surviving corporation of such stockholder’s certificates. The Court of Chancery’s decree may be
enforced as other decrees in such Court may be enforced.

The costs of the action (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the
Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery deems equitable. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court
of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged
pro rata against the value of all the shares of Company common stock entitled to appraisal. In the absence of an order, each party bears
its own expenses.

Any stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal rights for shares of Company common stock in compliance with
Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the effective time, be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment
of dividends or other distributions thereon, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of shares of Company
common stock as of a date or time prior to the effective time.

At any time within 60 days after the effective time, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered in the merger; after this period, the stockholder may withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal only with the
consent of the Company. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Court of Chancery within 120 days after the effective time,
stockholders’

rights to appraisal shall cease, and all holders of shares of Company common stock will be entitled to receive the merger consideration.
Inasmuch as the Company has no obligation to file such a petition and has no present intention to do so, any holder of shares of
Company common stock who desires such a petition to be filed is advised to file it on a timely basis. Any stockholder may withdraw
such stockholder’s demand for appraisal by delivering to the Company a written withdrawal of its demand for appraisal and acceptance
of the merger consideration, except that (i) any such attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective time will require
written approval of the Company and (ii) no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder
without the approval of the Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court of Chancery deems
just. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a
named party may withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and accept the terms offered upon the merger within 60 days after
the effective time.

If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must not vote your shares of Company common stock in favor of the
merger, and you must comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If you fail to take any required step in
connection with the exercise of appraisal rights, it will result in the termination or waiver of your appraisal rights.

The foregoing summary of the rights of Company stockholders to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law does not purport
to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by Company stockholders desiring to exercise any appraisal rights
available thereunder and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL. The proper exercise of appraisal rights
requires adherence to the applicable provisions of the DGCL. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex F to this proxy
statement.

STOCK OWNERSHIP

We have listed below, as of May 30, 2017 (except as otherwise indicated), the beneficial ownership of Company common
stock by (i) each of our directors, (ii) each of our “named executive officers,” (iii) all of our directors and executive officers as a group
and (iv) each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the number of outstanding shares of
Company common stock. The table is based on information we received from the directors and executive officers and filings made
with the SEC. We are not aware of any other beneficial owner of more than five percent of the number of outstanding shares of
Company common stock as of May 30, 2017. Unless otherwise indicated, each of our directors and “named executive officers” has the
same business address as the Company. All share numbers have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Except as otherwise indicated in the
footnotes to the table below, we believe that the beneficial owners of Company common stock listed below, based on the information
furnished by such owners, have sole voting power and investment power with respect to such shares, subject to applicable community
property laws. We have based our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership on 68,911,660 shares of Company common
stock issued and outstanding as of May 30, 2017. In computing the number of shares of Company common stock beneficially owned
by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding any shares of Company common stock as to which
the person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days of May 30, 2017, through the exercise of any option, conversion
rights, or other rights. We did not deem these shares outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other
person.

must have satisfied all applicable requirements of Rule 14a-8 and must have been received by the Corporate Secretary of the Company
no later than July 20, 2017. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to require the Company to include in its proxy statement and
proxy relating to the 2017 annual meeting any stockholder proposal that may be omitted from the proxy materials of the Company
under applicable regulations of the Exchange Act in effect at the time such proposal is received.

Our amended and restated bylaws provide that for a proposal to be properly brought by a stockholder before the annual
meeting of stockholders to be held during calendar year 2017, notice of such proposal must generally be delivered to, or mailed and
received at, the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the first anniversary

HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIAL

If you and other residents at your mailing address own shares of Company common stock in “street name,” your bank,
broker, trust or other nominee may have sent you a notice that your household will receive only one annual report and proxy statement
or notice of Internet availability of proxy for each company in which you hold stock through that broker or bank. This practice, known
as “householding,” is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs. If you did not respond that you did not want to participate in
householding, the bank, broker, trust or other nominee will assume that you have consented and will send only one copy of our annual
report and proxy statement or notice of Internet availability of proxy to your address. If you desire to revoke your consent to
householding, please contact your bank, broker, trust, or other nominee. In any event, if you did not receive an individual copy of this
proxy statement or if you wish to receive individual copies of our proxy statements, annual reports or notices of Internet availability of
proxy, as applicable, for future meetings, we will send a copy to you if you write our Corporate Secretary at Cabela’s Incorporated, One
Cabela Drive, Sidney, Nebraska 69160, or call (308) 254-5505.

If you and other residents at your mailing address are registered stockholders and you received more than one copy of this
proxy statement, but you wish to receive only one copy of our annual report and proxy statement or notice of Internet availability of
proxy, you may request, in writing, that the Company eliminate these duplicate mailings. To request the elimination of duplicate copies,
please write to our Corporate Secretary at Cabela’s Incorporated, One Cabela Drive, Sidney, Nebraska 69160.

Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (A) if (x) the Framework Agreement is validly
terminated by Synovus in accordance with Section 8.1 of the Framework Agreement and (y) the Original Bank Purchase Agreement
(in the same form as executed on October 3, 2016) is automatically deemed to be re-executed in accordance with Section 8.2(c) of the

between the Company and Capital One, National Association, a national banking association is in effect, then: either, at the election of
the Company (which election shall be irrevocable and to be effective shall be delivered in writing to Parent no later than (x) if the

terminating party, the second Business Day following such termination), (1)(I) the Merger Consideration shall be $65.50 in cash,
without interest and subject to Section 2.05 and (II) the reference to the term Banking Business Transaction in the first sentence of
Section 5.06(f) shall be deemed to be the Banking Business Transaction on the terms contemplated by the Original Bank Purchase
Agreement and the credit card program agreement dated as of October 3, 2016 between the Company and Capital One, National
Association, a national banking association (in the same form as executed on October 3, 2016, without amendment or modification) or
(2)(I) the Merger Consideration shall be $62.50 in cash, without interest and subject to Section 2.05 and (II) the reference to the term
Banking Business Transaction in the first sentence of Section 5.06(f) shall be deemed to be the Banking Business Transaction on the

and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Merger Consideration Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 2.01(b) shall be deemed to permit or authorize the Company to effect any such reclassification, stock split,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,

readjustment, other similar transaction, stock dividend or stock distribution that is not otherwise authorized or permitted to be
undertaken pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.02 Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares.

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a U.S.-based nationally recognized financial institution
designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash
amount in immediately available funds equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration (the “Exchange Fund”). In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.01(a)(i) (including if any Dissenting Shares
cease to be Dissenting Shares), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an
amount sufficient to make such payments. Funds made available to the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed
by Parent, in short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of
America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of Shares
pursuant to this Article II; provided that no investment of such deposited funds shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by this Article II, and following any losses from any such investment,
Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, in the amount of such
losses, which additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same manner as funds initially deposited with the Paying Agent for
payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to Sub or
Parent, as Parent directs. Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the former holders of
Company Common Stock and to make payments from the Exchange Fund in accordance with Section 2.02(b). The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 2.02(b), except as expressly provided for in this
Agreement.

(b) Payment Procedures.

(i) Certificates. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business
Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.02(e)) to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent and the Company may agree; and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of any Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in
accordance with Section 2.02(e)) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, if applicable, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, and such other customary documents and instruments as may be
reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the portion of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to
Section 2.01(a)(i), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and Merger Consideration may be
issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall either pay to the Paying Agent
any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not required to be paid.

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration

that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II (or such other amount paid in respect of Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Section 2.04). In lieu thereof, each such registered holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective
Time be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Merger Consideration for each
Book-Entry Share and such Book-Entry Share shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

(iii) No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of any Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.02(e)) or Book-Entry Share.

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement.

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. At any time following the six-month anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) not disbursed to or claimed by holders of Shares, and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable in respect of their Shares in accordance with the procedures set forth
in Section 2.02(b), without interest and subject to Section 2.05. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public
official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any portion of the Merger Consideration that
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent and Parent) of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented
by such Certificate were converted pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i); provided, however, that the Paying Agent or Parent may, in its
reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount.

Section 2.03 Treatment of Company Options and Equity Plans.

fully vested and cancelled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof and, in exchange therefor,
each holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such

price per Share subject to such cancelled Company Option, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the “Option Payments”);
provided, however, that (1) any such Company Option with respect to which the exercise price per Share subject thereto is equal or
greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration and (2) such Option Payments shall be
reduced by the amount of any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.05. From and after the Effective Time, no Company
Option shall be outstanding or exercisable, and each Company Option holder shall be entitled only to the payment provided for in this
Section 2.03(a).

(b) Treatment of Restricted Stock Units. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company’s board of directors (or the appropriate

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) shall be fully vested, (ii) any performance conditions applicable to such RSU
Award shall be deemed satisfied in full and (iii) shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled RSU Award shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of
the cancellation of such RSU Award and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (A) the number
of RSUs subject to such RSU Award, multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration, without interest (less any required Tax withholdings
as provided in Section 2.05).

(c) Termination of Company Stock Plans. As of the Effective Time, all Company Stock Plans shall terminate, and, except as
provided in this Section 2.03, no further rights with respect to Shares, Company Options, RSUs or RSU Awards shall be granted or
remain outstanding or in effect thereunder, and the Company shall have taken all actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the Company
to any person pursuant to or in settlement of awards under the Company Stock Plans.

(d) Treatment of Company Stock Purchase Plan. The Company and the Company’s board of directors (or appropriate committee
thereof) shall take all necessary actions, including adopting all necessary resolutions or amendments, to provide that (i) no Shares may
be purchased under the Company Stock Purchase Plan with respect to offering periods beginning on or after the date of this
Agreement, (ii) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate, (iii) if the Effective
Time occurs prior to the last day of the offering period in effect as of the date of this Agreement, such offering period shall end not later
than the trading day that is seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, at which time the cash amounts accumulated in each
account under the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall be used to purchase Shares, and (iv) participants in the Company Stock
Purchase Plan shall be prohibited from increasing their payroll deductions from those in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

(e) Payment with respect to Company Options and RSUs. The Surviving Corporation shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, through
the Payroll Agent the payments required under Section 2.03(a) and Section 2.03(b) hereof (in each case, subject to Section 2.05), as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, or at such later time as necessary to avoid a violation and/or adverse tax consequences
under Section 409A of the Code.

Section 2.04 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Shares
held by a person (a “Dissenting Stockholder”) who has not voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement and has
properly demanded appraisal of such Shares and complied in all respects with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of
holders of Shares to require appraisal of their Shares (“Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as described in Section 2.01(a)(i), but shall be converted into the right to receive fair value of such Share as determined
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or
fails to perfect or otherwise loses or waives its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL,

threats for appraisal of Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands or threats and any other documents received by
the Company in respect thereof (including instruments served on the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL), and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, threats or documents. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands or threats or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable in respect of the Shares, Company
Options and RSU Awards cancelled in the Merger such Tax amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, any regulation promulgated thereunder by the United States Department of Treasury (a “Treasury
Regulation”) or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that Tax amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld Tax amounts (a) shall be remitted by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Payroll Agent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options or RSU Awards in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of the Company, which shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of
such tender offer or exchange offer) within ten Business Days after commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act (provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, a statement that the Company’s board of directors recommends against acceptance of
such tender or exchange offer but, in accordance with Section 5.03, is engaging in discussions or negotiations with the person making

legal counsel that failure to provide a limited waiver to any such standstill agreement solely to permit the counterparty thereto privately

the fiduciary duties of the Company’s board of directors to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Law, the Company may
provide such limited waiver) or (vii) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.

financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company’s board of directors to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

(ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Company’s intention to make a Change of Company
Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement in order to cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the
Competing Proposal at least five (5) days prior to making such Change of Company Recommendation or terminating this Agreement
(such time period, the “Match Period” and such notice, a “Notice of Change of Recommendation”), which notice shall identify the
person making such Superior Proposal and include an unredacted draft of the definitive agreement to effect such Superior Proposal and
any financing documents (which may be redacted in a customary manner) relating thereto (it being agreed that neither (x) the delivery
of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the Company nor (y) the public announcement that the Company’s board of directors
(or any committee thereof) has received a Competing Proposal, is evaluating such Competing Proposal and has delivered such notice
shall constitute a Change of Company Recommendation unless and until the Company shall have failed within 24 hours after the end
of the Match Period (after giving effect to the proviso in Section 5.03(d)(iv)) to publicly announce that it (A) is recommending the
Merger and (B) has determined that such Competing Proposal (taking into account (x) any modifications or adjustments made to this
Agreement agreed to by the Parent in writing and (y) any modifications or adjustments made to such Competing Proposal) is not a
Superior Proposal and has publicly rejected such Competing Proposal);

(iii) if requested by Parent, the Company has negotiated in good faith, and directed any applicable Company Representatives
to negotiate in good faith, with Parent for at least five (5) days following receipt by Parent of such Notice of Change of
Recommendation with respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in a written offer; and

(iv) taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to by Parent in a written offer to the Company
pursuant to clause (iii) above, the Company’s board of directors (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such changes agreed to in writing by Parent were to be given effect; provided, that any amendment to the amount
or form of consideration contemplated by such Competing Proposal or any other material amendment to the terms of such Competing
Proposal (whether or not in response to any changes proposed by Parent pursuant to clause (iii) above) shall

require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation and an additional three (3)-day period from the date of such notice during which
the terms of clauses (ii) and (iii) above and this clause (iv) shall apply mutatis mutandis.

(e) Other than in connection with a Competing Proposal (which shall be subject to Section 5.03(d) and shall not be subject to this
Section 5.03(e)), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company’s board of directors (or any committee thereof) from
withholding, modifying or amending, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation if there is an Intervening Event, as
a result of which, the Company’s board of directors (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure of the Company’s board of directors (or any committee thereof)
to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company’s board of directors to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; provided, that:

(i) the Company shall give Parent at least five (5) days advance written notice of its intention to take such action (such time
period, the “Intervening Event Period” and such notice, an “Intervening Event Notice”), which notice shall include a reasonably
detailed summary of the relevant Intervening Event (it being agreed that neither the delivery of the Intervening Event Notice nor the
public announcement that the Company has delivered an Intervening Event Notice shall constitute a Change of Company
Recommendation unless and until the Company shall have failed within 24 hours after the end of the Intervening Event Period to
publicly announce that it is recommending the Merger);

(ii) the Company shall give Parent at least five (5) days following receipt by Parent of such notice to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement (or make another proposal) and shall, and shall have directed the applicable Company Representatives to,
negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, during such five (5)-day period;
and

(iii) following the end of such five (5)-day period, the Company’s board of directors (or any committee thereof) determines
in good faith, after taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent in a written offer to the Company
pursuant to clause (ii) above and in consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure of the
Company’s board of directors (or any committee thereof) to effect a Change of Company Recommendation would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company’s board of directors to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit the Company’s board of directors (or any committee thereof) from
(i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Company’s board of
directors (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company’s board of directors to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or
the Company’s board of directors (or any committee thereof) of a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position, as
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of Company
Recommendation); provided, however, that any disclosure under the foregoing clause (i) shall be deemed a Change of Company
Recommendation unless it includes either an express rejection of any applicable Competing Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the
Company Recommendation; provided, further, however, that the board of directors of the Company may not make a Change of
Company Recommendation unless permitted to do so by Section 5.03(d) or Section 5.03(e).

(g) If any Competing Proposal is made as a result of any action by a Company Representative that would constitute a breach of
this Section 5.03 had the Company taken such action, such Competing Proposal shall, solely for purposes of Section 5.03(b), Section
5.03(c), Section 5.03(d), Section 7.01(e) and the definition of “Superior Proposal”, be deemed to have resulted from a breach of this
Section 5.03.

Section 5.04 Proxy Statement; Stockholder Meeting.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following April 17, 2017, the Company shall prepare and file a preliminary Proxy
Statement with the SEC. Subject to Section 5.03, the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Recommendation. Parent shall
cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and shall furnish all information concerning it, Sub, the Equity
Financing Sources and any of their respective affiliates that is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the preparation
of the Proxy Statement. The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or any related documents (or in each
case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall
provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or written response and shall consider in good faith any
comments on such document or response reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of
any comments (written or oral) to the Proxy Statement from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement to
modify any information solely relating to Parent, Sub, the Equity Financing Sources and any of their respective affiliates shall be made
without the prior written approval of Parent unless required by applicable Law (and then only after Parent has been provided an
opportunity to review and comment on such amendment or supplement and the Company has considered in good faith any comments
on such amendment or supplement reasonably proposed by Parent).

(b) If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, any information relating to the Company or Parent, Sub, the Equity
Financing Sources or any of their respective affiliates is discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall as promptly as practicable notify the other party.
Following such notification, the Company shall file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information as promptly as reasonably practicable after Parent has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and,
to the extent the Company determines it is required by applicable Law, the Company shall disseminate such amendment or supplement
to the stockholders of the Company.

(c) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the
Company’s stockholders in accordance with Section 5.04(a) (and in any event no more than forty-five (45) days after such clearance),
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the “Company Stockholder Meeting”) for the purpose of
voting on (i) the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, (ii) a non-binding advisory proposal to approve
change-in-control payments to executives of the Company, and (iii) a proposal to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the Agreement. Except as required by
applicable Law, the Company shall not submit any other proposal to its stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent. The record date and meeting date of the Company Stockholder Meeting shall be selected by the
Company after reasonable consultation with Parent. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
may, in its reasonable discretion, adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting after consultation with Parent only (A) to the extent
necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that the Company has determined in good faith after
consultation with its legal counsel is required under applicable Law is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable
amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholder Meeting, (B) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) or is scheduled to reconvene following an adjournment thereof, there are
insufficient shares of Company Common

Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder
Meeting or to the extent that at such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting or (C) the Company determines the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with applicable Law; provided, however, that unless and only for so long as the Company is in a Match Period, the Company
Stockholder Meeting shall not be adjourned for more than twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate from the originally scheduled
date of the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent on a daily basis on each of the last seven (7) days
prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting (and any reconvening thereof) as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by
the Company with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval and whether such proxies have been voted affirmatively or
negatively with respect to each of the proposals to be presented at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to Section 5.03, the
Company’s board of directors shall recommend that the Company’s stockholders adopt this Agreement (the “Company
Recommendation”), and the Company shall, unless there has been a Change of Company Recommendation permitted by this
Agreement, or this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall be permitted to call and hold its 2016 annual meeting of stockholders so long
as the matters to be voted upon at such meeting do not include the consideration of any Competing Proposal and would not otherwise
constitute a breach of Section 5.03.

Section 5.05 Access to Information. From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause
each Company Subsidiary to: (a) provide to Parent and Sub and their respective representatives, and to the Debt Financing Sources,
reasonable access during normal business hours in such a manner as not to interfere with the operation of any business conducted by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, upon prior written notice to the Company, to the officers, employees, properties, offices and
other facilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof; and (b) furnish promptly such
information concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as Parent
or its representatives may reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to (or to cause any Company
Subsidiary to) afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company believes in good faith that doing so would:
(i) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access
or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege); (ii) violate any confidentiality obligations of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to any third person or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective Contract to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is party; (iii) result in a competitor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
receiving information that is competitively sensitive; or (iv) breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law (including the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law); provided, further, if any of the restrictions in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) shall apply, the
Company shall advise Parent of the subject matter of any such information that cannot be disclosed and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including adopting additional specific procedures to protect
the confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable Laws. Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives, to hold all information provided or furnished pursuant to this Section 5.05
confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. During any visit to the business or property sites of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each of Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their respective representatives accessing
such properties to, comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws and all of the Company’s and the Company Subsidiaries’
safety and security procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.05, from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, none of Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates shall conduct, without the prior written
consent of the Company, any environmental investigation at any real property owned or leased by the Company, including any
sampling or other intrusive investigation of air, surface water, groundwater or soil at or in connection with any of such real property.
The Confidentiality Agreement is hereby amended to include in the definition of “Representatives” contained therein

information to any of the foregoing shall be made subject to the acknowledgment and acceptance by such recipient that such
information is being disseminated on a confidential basis in accordance with standard syndication processes or customary market
standards for dissemination of such types of information, which shall in any event require “click through” or other affirmative actions
on the part of the recipient to access such information. Parent and the Debt Financing Sources shall be permitted to share with the
rating agencies confidential information of the Company of the type customarily shared with rating agencies, subject to customary
confidentiality procedures.

Section 5.06 Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation; Regulatory Filings.

Parent shall (and shall cause Sub and each of its affiliates to) and the Company shall (and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries
to) use its reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly obtain all actions or nonactions, consents (including Required Consents), Permits
(including Environmental Permits), waivers, approvals, authorizations and orders from Governmental Entities or other persons
necessary or advisable in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) as promptly as

entities” or “ultimate controlling persons” under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and any Banking Laws, and promptly make
any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary or advisable, (iii) other than with respect to any proceeding under the HSR

proceedings to which it or any of its affiliates is a party challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case until the issuance of a final, non-appealable order with respect to each such
lawsuit or proceeding, (B) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order which may adversely affect the ability of
the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case until the issuance of a final, non-appealable order with

transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Neither Parent nor Sub, directly or indirectly, through one or more of their respective

consummation of the Merger.

(b) Subject to Sections 5.06(d) and 5.06(e), the Company shall (and shall cause each of its affiliates to) promptly make all filings

Parent’s consent right under this Section 5.06(b), use reasonable best efforts to (and to cause each of its affiliates to) obtain all
approvals and consents under any Banking Laws that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental
Entity, in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to consummate the Banking Business Transaction as
promptly as practicable; provided, however, that (x) the Company shall not (and shall not permit any of its affiliates to), without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any undertaking or
commitment pursuant to this Section 5.06(b) or otherwise in connection with obtaining any required approvals or consents under any
Banking Laws for the Banking Business Transaction, if, in each case, the taking of such action would result in Parent, Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates incurring any continuing liability or obligation after the Closing that would
be material to the Parent and its affiliates, taken as a whole, following completion of the Merger, and (y) the Company shall not be
required to make any undertaking, commitment or concession that is not conditioned upon the Closing occurring.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Parent and the Company’s undertaking pursuant to Section 5.06(a), and notwithstanding any
limitations therein or elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each of its respective
affiliates to, use its and their reasonable best efforts to take as promptly as possible any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any antitrust or competition
Governmental Entity or any other person so as to enable the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated as promptly as
possible, including with respect to (but not limited to) complying with or modifying any requests for additional information by any
Governmental Entity as soon as possible (including prior to issuance of a “second request”) and using reasonable best efforts to prepare
presentations and materials for submission to any such Governmental Entity (including prior to issuance of a “second request”). In
addition, Parent shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, prior to the Outside Date, defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in court by any person in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any order that would prevent or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including contesting, defending, resisting or appealing any action or other
proceeding until a final, non-appealable order is entered unless this Agreement has been earlier terminated in accordance with its terms.
If the parties receive a “second request”, each of the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to certify compliance with such “second
request” as promptly as practicable (and in any event within three months after receipt thereof) and to produce documents on a rolling
basis, and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such “second request” review process.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates shall be obligated to consent to any divestiture
or other structural or conduct relief in order to obtain clearance from any Governmental Entity. Without limiting the generality of
anything contained in this Section 5.06, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making or
commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from any Banking
Regulator, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Merger or the Banking Business
Transaction, as applicable. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views
of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
Banking Business Transaction. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with

parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and to
have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity
in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.06, no party hereto shall be in violation of this Agreement by virtue of providing information that is competitively sensitive
to one another on an “outside counsel only” or other basis designed to ensure compliance with applicable Law (including the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law).

the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Banking Business Transaction on the terms and conditions described

to any default or material breach) by any party under the Bank Purchase Agreement of which the Company becomes aware, (x) of any
termination of the Bank Purchase Agreement, (y) of the receipt of any written notice or other communication from any person with
respect to any (1) default, material breach, termination or repudiation of the Bank Purchase Agreement by any party thereto, or

actual or potential failure or delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals, or otherwise in satisfying any other conditions
necessary, in each case, to consummate the Banking Business Transaction on the terms set forth in the Bank Purchase Agreement.

the Company Subsidiaries to) take all actions reasonably necessary to (i) surrender any Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit
insurance of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and (ii) receive confirmation of such surrender from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.

Closing, Parent shall not and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its affiliates not to enter into any agreements with any party to
the Bank Purchase Agreement or any of such person’s affiliates relating to this Agreement, the Bank Purchase Agreement or any of the
transactions or matters contemplated hereby or thereby without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be

into any such agreement to the extent that such agreement do not take effect until after the Closing Date or otherwise only relates to
matters that arise from and after the Closing Date. Parent shall permit the Company to be reasonably involved in meetings and
substantive scheduled discussions with the counterparty to the Bank Purchase Agreement or any of its affiliates relating to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Bank Purchase Agreement or any party’s obligations prior to
Closing under this Agreement or the Bank Purchase Agreement, provided, that Parent shall not be required to include the Company in
any portions of such meetings or discussions during which competitively sensitive information of Parent or any of its affiliates is being

Agreement is terminated, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange for the Company an alternative transaction
for the sale of the Banking Business (an “Alternative Banking Business Transaction”), in the most expeditious manner practicable (and,
in any event, prior to the date that is five (5) Business Days before the Outside Date), pursuant to a transaction with another third party
and on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company and pursuant to a replacement Bank Purchase Agreement (such alternative
transaction arranged by Parent for the Company or any alternative transaction arranged by the Company, the “Alternative Bank
Purchase Agreement”); provided that the Company shall not, without Parent’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into any Alternative Banking Business Transaction on terms or conditions
(i) that are materially less favorable to the Company (or from and after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation) than
the Banking Business Transaction contemplated by the Bank Purchase Agreement delivered to Parent as of the date hereof (including
with respect to (A) the Tax treatment of such transaction, (B) the retained liabilities of the Company from and after the consummation
of any such transaction and (C) the credit card program agreement with the bank purchaser party to the Bank Purchase Agreement) or
(ii) that would reasonably be expected to materially impair the timely satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI.
The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives to, permit Parent and its representatives to be involved in
discussions, negotiations, communications or other actions regarding such Alternative Banking Business Transaction and related credit
card program agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall furnish Parent complete copies of all
material drafts of any Alternative Bank Purchase Agreement and related credit card program agreement in connection with the
negotiations thereof (in addition to the executed copy of such Alternative Bank Purchase Agreement and related credit card program
agreement promptly upon the execution thereof) and shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed as to the status and material
terms of any negotiations in connection therewith. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, execute and
deliver the Alternative Bank Purchase Agreement (subject to Parent’s consent rights under this Section 5.06(f)).

(g) Nothing in this Section 5.06 shall be deemed to prohibit or limit the Company’s and the Company Subsidiaries’ ability to take
the actions contemplated by Section 5.03.

Section 5.07 Financing.

(a) Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts and do all things necessary or advisable to obtain the Financing as soon
as reasonably practicable and, in any event, not later than the date the Closing is required to be effected in accordance with
Section 1.02, on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent applicable, the “flex” provisions) described in the Financing
Commitments (for purposes of this Section 5.07, the Financing

Commitments and the Debt Commitment Letter shall include any Fee Letter), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions (as such terms may be modified or adjusted in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, and within the limits of the “flex” provisions contained in any Fee Letter)
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or on such other terms acceptable to Parent and the applicable Debt Financing Sources
so long as such other terms would not (x) delay or prevent the Closing, (y) adversely impact or delay in any respect the likelihood of
the funding of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining any of the Financing) or
(z) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Equity Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements (in each case, in accordance with their terms) or the ability of
Parent or Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (the “Definitive Debt Financing Agreements”), (ii) satisfy
on a timely basis all terms, conditions and covenants, including with respect to the payment of any commitment, engagement or
placement fees, applicable to Parent or Sub in the Financing Commitments and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements that are in
Parent’s and Sub’s control to satisfy, (iii) consummate (and cause the Financing Sources to consummate) the Financing at or prior to
Closing and (iv) enforce their rights under the Financing Commitments and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements. Prior to the
Closing, Parent and Sub shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other
provision under the Financing Commitments or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements without the prior written consent of the
Company (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that, without the Company’s consent,
Parent and Sub may (1) agree to any amendments, restatements, modifications or waivers to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements if such amendment, restatement, modification or waiver would not (and would not be
reasonably expected to) (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing (including by changing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing or similar fee) unless, in the case of any reduction in the
amount of the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount (and vice versa), (B) impose new or
additional conditions, or otherwise expand or adversely amend any conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing or Equity
Financing, (C) delay or prevent the Closing, (D) adversely impact the likelihood of the funding of the Debt Financing or the Equity
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining any of the Financing) or (E) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements or the ability of Parent or Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (clauses (A), (B),
(C), (D) and (E), collectively, the “Prohibited Financing Amendments”); and (2) amend, restate, supplement or otherwise modify the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements to add lenders, lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents
or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement (but not make any other
changes), but only if the addition of such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in the occurrence of a
Prohibited Financing Amendment. Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the Financing
Commitments (including any Definitive Debt Financing Agreements) until the Closing occurs (provided, that the foregoing shall not
limit Parent’s or Sub’s right to amend, restate, modify or waive the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence). Prior to Closing, neither Parent nor Sub shall release
or consent to the termination of the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Debt Financing Agreements without the prior written consent of the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall have the right to (i) reduce the commitments under the Debt
Commitment Letter by an amount not to exceed the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds from consummated offerings or other
incurrences of debt (including notes) of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries consummated after the date hereof for which such proceeds have
been received by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and are not subject to any conditions or contingencies to financing
(including conditions to any escrow agreement) that are not contained in, or are more expansive or less favorable to Parent than those
contained in, the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) substitute such proceeds for the amount by which the commitments under the
Commitment Letter are reduced; provided that: (A) an amount in cash or cash

equivalents equal to such substituted proceeds is retained by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries and such amount has been identified by
Parent for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and there are no conditions or restrictions on
Parent’s ability to use such amount to fund the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any restriction as to which a
Subsidiary of Parent is subject, to the extent such restriction prohibits such Subsidiary from transferring, directly or indirectly, such
amount to Parent); (B) such substituted proceeds shall be in an amount sufficient, together with the Equity Financing and any
remaining Debt Financing, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; and (C) to the extent any of such proceeds are from
consummated offerings or other incurrences of debt (including notes) that have scheduled redemptions or mandatory redemptions or
put rights (other than customary change of control redemption or put rights), such scheduled redemption is not scheduled to occur prior
to, and such right is not exercisable prior to, a date that is earlier than the Outside Date. Further, Parent shall have the right to substitute
commitments in respect of other financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative bona fide third
party financing sources reasonably acceptable to the Company (which will be in an amount sufficient to fund, when taken together with
the Equity Financing and the other resources of Parent and other financing arrangements, the Financing Uses), so long as (1) all
conditions precedent and contingencies to funding of such financing are in the aggregate, in respect of certainty of funding, equivalent
to (or more favorable to Parent than) the conditions precedent and contingencies set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, to replace
the Debt Financing and (2) such substitution does not (x) delay or prevent the Closing, (y) adversely impact the likelihood of the
funding of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing or (z) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Sub to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements (in
each case, in accordance with their terms) or the ability of Parent or Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(“Alternative Financing”). If the Debt Commitment Letter (or any Definitive Debt Financing Agreement) expires or is terminated or
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any “flex” provisions) contemplated in
the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event but no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately preceding the Outside Date, arrange for and obtain
debt financing from alternative sources so long as such alternative financing would constitute an Alternative Financing. The new debt
commitment letter and fee letter entered into in connection with any Alternative Financing are referred to, respectively, as a “New Debt
Commitment Letter” and a “New Fee Letter.” In the event Parent or Sub enter into any such New Debt Commitment Letter (or any
amendment, restatement, supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms of Section 5.07(a)),
(a) Parent and Sub shall promptly provide the Company with true, correct and complete copies thereof, (b) any reference in this
Agreement to the “Debt Financing” shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as so modified or by
such New Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable, and (c) any reference in this Agreement to the “Debt Commitment Letter” (and any
definition incorporating the term “Debt Commitment Letter,” including the definition of Definitive Debt Financing Agreements) shall
be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter and any Fee Letter as so modified to the extent not superseded by a New Debt
Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter, as the case may be, at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee
Letter to the extent then in effect.

(c) Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their representatives to, keep the Company informed as promptly as practicable in
reasonable detail of the status of their efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and, subject to applicable confidentiality restrictions (which
shall be no more restrictive than the Debt Commitment Letter delivered to the Company prior to the Closing Date), substantially
concurrently with their execution provide copies of all definitive agreements entered into with respect to the Debt Financing to the
Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies
of any amendments to the Financing Commitments promptly upon their execution and (ii) give the Company prompt written notice
(A) of any default or breach (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (or would reasonably be expected
to) give rise to any default or breach) by any party under any of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing of which Parent or Sub becomes aware, if such breach or default would reasonably be expected to affect the timely
availability of, or the amount of, the Financing, (B) of any termination of either of the Financing Commitments, and (C) of the receipt

termination or repudiation of any Financing Commitment, any definitive agreement relating to the Financing or any provision of the
Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, in each case by any party thereto, or (2) material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing, in the case of each of clauses (1) and (2), that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the timely availability of, or
the amount of, the Financing.

(d) Prior to the Closing, at Parent’s sole expense, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and instruct the
Company Representatives to, in each case, use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Parent and Sub all customary
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Debt Financing or any
Alternative Financing, including using commercially reasonable efforts (i) to cause management of the Company to participate in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, sessions with rating agencies and due diligence sessions, in each case, with appropriate
seniority and expertise, (ii) to cooperate with marketing efforts for the Debt Financing, including (A) assisting the Debt Financing
Sources in benefitting from the existing lending relationships of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (B) providing reasonable
and customary assistance with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda (including
one or more confidential information memoranda) and other offering and marketing materials, (C) delivering customary authorization
letters and confirmations (including with respect to presence or absence of material non-public information and accuracy of the
information contained therein), (D) providing reasonable cooperation with the Debt Financing sources on their due diligence efforts
and the consummation of the Debt Financing to the extent reasonable and customary and (E) updating information provided in writing
by Parent describing the Company or the Company Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with normal customary practice in connection
with the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter such that, after giving effect to such updates, such information,
when taken as a whole, will be correct in all material respects and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not materially misleading in light of the circumstances
under which such statements are made (and, to the extent applicable, subject to the limitations contained in Section 5.05 hereof), (iii) to
the extent reasonably requested by Parent and required under the Debt Commitment Letter, (A) obtaining documents reasonably
requested by Parent or its Debt Financing Sources relating to the repayment of the existing indebtedness of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and the release of related liens and other security interests, including customary payoff letters and termination
documents and (B) within three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing all documentation and other information
required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable “know-your-customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the USA PATRIOT Act, relating to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case as reasonably requested
by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (iv) furnishing Parent and Sub and the Financing Sources with
(A) historic financial information required by paragraph 4 of Exhibit D of the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof,
(B) such historic financial information related to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as is reasonably required by Parent for
Parent to produce the pro forma financial statements identified in paragraph 5 of Exhibit D of the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date hereof and specified in writing by Parent to the Company and (C) such other customary financial data or other pertinent
information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent in writing no later than
20 Business Days after the date hereof and that is reasonably necessary to consummate the Debt Financing (clauses (A), (B) and
(C) together, the “Required Information”), provided that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to
prepare or provide any projections or information in connection with the potential purchase price accounting treatment of the Merger,
provided that none of the following shall be considered the Required Information and the Company shall have no obligation to provide
any such information: (1) any post-Closing or pro forma cost savings, capitalization and other post-Closing or (and the assumptions
relating thereto) desired by the Parent to be reflected in such pro forma data, (2) any projections or any information in connection with

underlying the post-Closing or pro forma adjustments to be made in such pro forma adjustments or (4) in the case of clause (C) of the
definition of Required Information, any adjustments to any pro forma financial information required to be provided in accordance with
the Debt Commitment Letter, (v) cooperate to facilitate the pledging of, granting of security interests in and obtaining perfection of any
liens on, collateral in connection with the Debt Financing and to deliver original stock certificates, if any, together with customary
stock powers executed in blank, with respect to the Company and the material, wholly owned U.S. Company Subsidiaries that are
required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be delivered in order to perfect the security interests of the lenders in such collateral and
(vi) take all actions reasonably requested by Parent and necessary to permit the prospective lenders involved in the Debt Financing to
evaluate the Company’s and the Company Subsidiaries’ inventory, current assets and cash management systems for the purpose of
establishing collateral arrangements (including sufficient access to allow the Debt Financing Sources to complete field exams and
conducting the commercial finance examination and inventory appraisals contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter within the
time frame described therein) (and, to the extent applicable, subject to the limitations contained in Section 5.05 hereof); provided,
however, that (1) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would (A) interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or (B) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any
action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, the Company Charter or Company Bylaws or other comparable organizational documents of the
Company Subsidiaries, any Applicable Laws or any Contract, (2) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
commit to take any action that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective at or prior to the Effective Time, (3) neither
the Company’s board of directors nor any of the Company Subsidiaries’ boards of directors (or equivalent bodies) shall be required to
approve or adopt any Financing or agreements related thereto (or any Alternative Financing), (4) neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries shall be required to execute or deliver any agreements, certificates or instruments in connection with any
Financing (or any Alternative Financing), provided that Parent shall be permitted to request that employees of the Company who have
been significantly involved in the negotiation of the Debt Financing and will continue to be employees following Closing execute such
agreements, certificates or instruments and (5) in no event shall the Company be in breach of this Agreement because of the failure of
any financial or other information to be delivered that is not available to the Company at the time requested by Parent. The Company
hereby consents to the use of its and the Company Subsidiaries’ logos in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such logos are
used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. None of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment (other than for
reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses that are reimbursed by Parent as provided below in this Section 5.07(d)) or incur any other
liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the Financing (including any action taken in accordance with this Section 5.07(d)) and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than historical information provided in writing by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the
Company Representatives specifically for use in connection therewith). Nothing contained in this Section 5.07(d) or otherwise shall
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing.

(e) Each of Parent and Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the Financing or any alternative financing is a
condition to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in Section 6.02(b), as it applies to the
Company’s obligations under this Section 5.07, shall be deemed satisfied unless the Financing has not been obtained primarily as a
result of the Company’s or any Company Subsidiary’s willful and material breach of its obligations under this Section 5.07 with respect
to the Financing.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations contained in this Section 5.07 shall terminate upon the occurrence of the Closing.

Section 5.08 Public Announcements. The initial press release issued by Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release, the contents of which have received prior approval from both such
parties, and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement without the other party’s prior written consent; provided, that the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.08
shall not apply to any press release, public statement or other announcement issued or made, or proposed to be issued or made, (a) by
the Company in connection with a Competing Proposal or Change of Company Recommendation or (b) as may be required by
applicable Law, the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of the Company to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, which, in the case of clause (b), the party
making such release, statement or other announcement shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party to the extent
practicable and permissible under applicable Law.

Section 5.09 Directors & Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Indemnification. From and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary thereof, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the Company’s or the applicable Company Subsidiary’s
organizational documents, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former director or officer of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries and each fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each an
“Indemnified Party” and collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against (i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees
and expenses), judgments, fines, claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next succeeding sentence, amounts paid
in settlement, arising out of actions or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time) to the extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or
fiduciary under benefit plans prior to the Effective Time (the “Indemnified Liabilities”), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent
they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, and including any expenses incurred in enforcing such person’s rights under this Section 5.09. In the event
of any such loss, expense, claim, damage or liability (whether or not asserted before the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly after statements therefor are
received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred
(provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by a final
and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to indemnification under
Law).

(b) Insurance. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for a “tail” insurance and indemnification policy for a claims
reporting period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the “D&O
Insurance”) that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended beneficiaries thereof
than the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy; provided, however, that neither the Company nor Parent
shall purchase such a “tail” policy for a premium amount for any one year in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid by the
Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance (the “Tail Cap”). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation
for any reason fail to obtain such “tail” insurance policy as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time
(and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six (6) year period thereunder are being adjudicated) the D&O
Insurance in

place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, purchase comparable D&O Insurance for such six (6) year period (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of
such six (6) year period thereunder are being adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof; provided, however, that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such D&O Insurance to the extent exceeding 300% of the annual
premium paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance and if the premiums of such insurance
coverage with respect to any policy year exceed the Tail Cap, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding the Tail Cap.

(c) Successors. In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors, assigns or transferees of the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.09.

(d) Continuation. For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or
other similar documents) of each Company Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws or the equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary. The contractual indemnification
rights, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and which are set forth in Section 5.09(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following the
Effective Time.

(e) Benefit. The provisions of this Section 5.09 (i) are intended, after the Closing, to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, executors or administrators and his or her representatives, (ii) shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and (iii) shall not be amended in a manner that is
adverse to any Indemnified Parties (including their successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of the Indemnified Party
(including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby.

(f) Non-Exclusivity. The provisions of this Section 5.09 are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement, including this
Section 5.09, is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims
under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Indemnified
Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.09 is not prior to, or in substitution for,
any such claims under any such policies.

Section 5.10 Takeover Statutes. The parties shall use all reasonable efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if
any Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize (to the greatest extent practicable) the effects of such Takeover Statute
on such transactions.

Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to provide to each individual who is an employee of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remains employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, following the Effective Time (each, a “Company Employee”) (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than
the base salary or wage rate provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual cash bonus
opportunity and/or cash commission opportunity (if applicable) that is not less favorable than the aggregate annual cash bonus
opportunity and/or cash commission opportunity (if applicable) (excluding any award opportunity under any “Spot Award Policy” or

Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits
provided under the severance plan, policy or agreement in effect for the benefit of such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (iv) long-term incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than those provided by Parent to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (if any) and (v) other compensation and benefits (including retirement and
welfare benefits and paid-time off, but excluding long-term incentive, equity-based or equity-linked compensation) that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the other compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the

control or severance agreement between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any Company Employee), in each case, in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or
rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event);
provided, that, the foregoing shall not prohibit Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) from amending,
suspending or terminating any such arrangements in accordance with their terms.

policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, including any vacation,
paid time off and severance plans, each Company Employee’s service with or otherwise credited by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation; provided, however,
that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to use commercially reasonable efforts to
waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in which Company
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that
such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or
waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the
dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year’s deductible and
co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Company Employee (and dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.

Section 8.03 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by
any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect
so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to
any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 8.04 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Annexes, Exhibits, Company Disclosure Letter and the other
documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede
all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

Section 8.05 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned or transferred, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written
consent of the other parties; provided, however, that each of Parent and Sub may assign this Agreement and any of its rights hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Company to (a) any of the Debt Financing Sources pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements to the extent necessary for purposes of creating a security interest herein
or otherwise assigning this Agreement and its rights hereunder as collateral in respect of the Debt Financing or (b) to any of its
affiliates; provided further, however, that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Sub of any of their respective obligations
hereunder. Any assignment or transfer in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void.

Section 8.06 Parties in Interest.

(a) Except for (i) Article II, which, after the Closing, shall be for the benefit of any person entitled to payment thereunder and
(ii) Section 5.09, which, after the Closing, shall be for the benefit of each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, executors or
administrators and his or her representatives, Parent, Sub and the Company hereby agree that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto
further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence shall not arise unless and
until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties may be subject to
waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 7.04 without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of
this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 8.07 Mutual Drafting; Interpretation; Headings. Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement,
which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the
context requires: (a) the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; (b) the masculine gender shall include the feminine
and neuter genders; (c) the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and (d) the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words “include” and “including,” and words of similar meaning, shall
not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” Except as
otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to “Sections,” “Annexes” and “Exhibits,” are intended to refer to Sections of this
Agreement and the Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to “$” are intended to refer to U.S.
dollars. The term “or” shall not be deemed to be exclusive. The words “hereof,” “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import,
when used in this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. References
herein to “as of the date hereof,” “as of the date of this Agreement” or words of similar import shall be deemed to mean “as of
immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement.” Whenever the phrase “has not had and would not be reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect” is used, “has not had” shall be construed to mean “has not had since January 1,
2016”. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that the
Financing is the responsibility of Parent and Sub and not the Company or any Company Subsidiary and that (i) the Company makes no
representations or warranties relating to the Financing (including whether the Company has authorized the Financing or whether any of
the transactions contemplated by the Financing conflict with or violate any obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party), (ii) except for Section 5.07(d), none of the covenants of the
Company in this Agreement require the Company to take any action relating to the Financing and (iii) for purposes of the
representations and warranties and covenants and obligations of the Company hereunder, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not include the Financing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that
(A) except as set forth in Section 3.25, the Company makes no representations or warranties relating to the Bank Purchase Agreement,
the Banking Entities or the Banking Business (including any Indebtedness of any Banking Entity), (B) the Company shall be permitted
to take any actions required by the Bank Purchase Agreement or any other agreements or documents related thereto and doing so shall
not be considered a breach or violation of this Agreement and (C) no Banking Business Transaction shall be considered a Competing
Proposal unless it meets the requirements set forth in the definition thereof.

Section 8.08 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of Law thereof that would require the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction.

(b) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought
by any other party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over
a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court within the State of Delaware), and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and

contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any Proceeding relating thereto except in the courts in the State of
Delaware, as described above, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award
rendered by any such court. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of
process, and the parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in the State of Delaware, as described above, for any reason, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment
prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the Proceeding in
any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE FINANCING,
THE EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTER AND THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER AND ANY CONTROVERSY AGAINST
ANY FINANCING SOURCE). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.08(C).

that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether
in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (ii) submits for itself and its
property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (iii) agrees that service of process, summons,
notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in Section 8.02 shall be effective service of process against
it for any such action brought in any such court, (iv) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of, any such action in any such court and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

Section 8.09 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic
delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Section 8.10 Specific Performance.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed, or were threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
the parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to Section 8.10(c), the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) Each of the parties agrees that, subject to Section 8.10(c), (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant to this Section 8.10 shall not in
any way constitute a waiver by any party seeking such remedies of its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to it
under this Agreement, including under Section 7.02, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this Section 8.10 are not available or otherwise are not granted, (ii) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall
require a party to institute any proceeding for (or limit a party’s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
Section 8.10 prior, or as a condition, to exercising any termination right under Article VII (and pursuing damages after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding seeking remedies pursuant to this Section 8.10 or anything set forth
in this Section 8.10 restrict or limit a party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VII or pursue
any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter and (iii) no party shall require the other to post any
bond or other security as a condition to institute any proceeding for specific performance under this Section 8.10.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall only be entitled to
specific performance of Parent’s obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), including by demanding Parent to enforce the obligations of the Equity
Financing Sources and Parent’s rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, in the event that each of the following conditions has been
satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of such conditions),
(ii) Parent fails to complete the Closing on the date the Closing should have occurred in accordance with Section 1.02, (iii) the Debt
Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iv) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that the Closing will occur if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing and the
Equity Financing is funded. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to (A) enforce specifically the
Parent’s right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Merger) if the Debt Financing has not been funded and will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing or (B) receive both a grant of specific performance and payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, Delaware 19808, County of New Castle. The name of its registered agent for service of
process in the State of Delaware at such address is Corporation Service Company.

THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “GCL”).

FOURTH: The total number of shares of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000, all of which
shares shall be common stock having a par value of $0.01 per share.

FIFTH:

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation is authorized to provide indemnification of (and
advancement of expenses to) directors, officers, employees and agents (and any other persons to which Delaware law permits the
Corporation to provide indemnification) through bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by Section 145 of the
GCL, subject only to limits created by applicable Delaware law (statutory or non-statutory), with respect to action for breach of duty to
the Corporation, its stockholders and others.

(b) No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any stockholder for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for any matter in respect of which such director shall be liable under Section 174 of the
GCL or any amendment thereto or shall be liable by reason that, in addition to any and all other requirements for such liability, such
director (1) shall have breached the director’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (2) shall have acted in manner not
in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law or, in failing to act, shall have acted in a manner not in
good faith or involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law or (3) shall have derived an improper personal benefit. If
the GCL is hereafter amended to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of a director, the liability of a director of
the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the GCL, as so amended.

(c) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is in any way involved in any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a “proceeding”),
including any appeal therefrom, by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was
a director or officer of the Corporation or a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director or officer of another entity or enterprise, or was a director or officer of a foreign or domestic corporation

determination, to the fullest extent authorized by the GCL. In any proceeding against the Corporation to enforce these rights, such
person shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification and the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that such person has
not met the standards of conduct for permissible indemnification set forth in the GCL. The rights to indemnification and advancement
of expenses conferred by this Article Fifth shall be presumed to have been relied upon by the directors and officers of the Corporation
in serving or continuing to serve the Corporation and shall be enforceable as contract rights. Said rights shall not be exclusive of any
other rights to which those seeking indemnification may otherwise be entitled. The Corporation may, upon written demand presented
by a director or officer of the Corporation or of a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, or by a person serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director or officer of another entity or enterprise, enter into contracts to provide such persons with specified
rights to indemnification, which contracts may confer rights and protections to the maximum extent permitted by the GCL, as amended
and in effect from time to time.

(d) If a claim under this Article Fifth is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been
received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of
the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expenses of prosecuting such claim. It
shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce the right to be advanced expenses incurred in defending
any proceeding prior to its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the
claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the GCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant
for the amount claimed, but the claimant shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification and the Corporation shall have the burden
of proving that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct for permissible indemnification set forth in the GCL.

(e) If the GCL is hereafter amended to permit the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted
the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment, the indemnification rights conferred by this Article Fifth shall be broadened to the
fullest extent permitted by the GCL, as so amended.

SIXTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the GCL, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is
expressly authorized to make, repeal, alter, amend and rescind any or all of the bylaws of the Corporation.

any period in which this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to Section 4.2 but in which the Company’s board of directors has

MEETING OF COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS, BY WRITTEN CONSENT IN LIEU THEREOF OR OTHERWISE) WITH
RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT SHARES REGARDING THE MATTERS REFERRED TO IN SECTION 1.1(A) UNTIL THE
TERMINATION DATE, TO THE SAME EXTENT AND WITH THE SAME EFFECT AS STOCKHOLDER MIGHT OR COULD
DO UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE PROXY GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION
1.1(B) IS COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND SHALL BE IRREVOCABLE UNTIL THE TERMINATION DATE. UNTIL THE

Stockholder may make Transfers of Subject Shares (i) by will, (ii) by operation of Law, (iii) for estate planning purposes, (iv) for
charitable purposes or as charitable gifts or donations, (v) to any of its Affiliates or (vi) to fund a tax liability arising from the exercise

continue to be bound by this Agreement and provided that each transferee thereof agrees in a writing reasonably acceptable to Parent to
be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement (each a “Permitted Transfer”). For the avoidance of doubt, if Stockholder is
not an individual, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict any direct or indirect Transfers of any equity interests in Stockholder. For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Stockholder may Transfer, or enter into any contract
with respect to any Transfer of, all or any portion of the Subject Shares at any time after the Company Stockholder Approval shall have
been obtained, and, if as a result of such Transfer Stockholder ceases to be the record or beneficial owner of such Subject Shares,
Stockholder shall have no obligations pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such Subject Shares.

1.3 Non-Solicitation. Unless this Agreement shall have terminated, Stockholder shall not take any action that would be a breach
of Section 5.03 of the Merger Agreement if taken by the Company.

1.4 No Exercise of Appraisal Rights. Stockholder hereby waives and agrees not to exercise any appraisal rights or right to dissent
in respect of the Subject Shares that may arise with respect to the Merger (under Section 262 of the DGCL or otherwise).

Effective Time), (a) Stockholder shall permit and hereby authorizes Parent and the Company to publish and disclose in all documents
and schedules filed with the SEC, and any press release or other disclosure document in connection with the Merger and any
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, a copy of this Agreement, Stockholder’s identity and ownership of the Subject
Shares and the nature of Stockholder’s commitments and obligations under this Agreement; and (b) Parent shall permit and hereby
authorizes Stockholder and its Affiliates, to the extent Stockholder or such Affiliates are required to do so by applicable Law, to publish

press release or other disclosure document in connection with the Merger and any transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
a copy of this Agreement, Parent’s identity and the nature of Stockholder’s commitments and obligations under this Agreement.

1.6 Stop Transfer Order; Legends. Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer, Stockholder hereby agrees that it will not
request that the Company register the Transfer of any certificate or uncertificated interest representing any of the Subject Shares, unless
such Transfer is made in compliance with this Agreement. In furtherance of this Agreement, concurrently herewith, Stockholder shall,
and hereby does, authorize the Company or its counsel to notify the Company’s transfer agent that there is a stop transfer order with
respect to all of the Subject Shares (and that this Agreement places limits on the voting and transfer of such shares). The parties hereto
agree that such stop transfer order shall be removed and shall be of no further force and effect upon the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 4.2.

VOTING AGREEMENT

This VOTING AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”), dated as of October 3, 2016, is entered into by and among Bass Pro
Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), Prairie Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (“Sub”), Cabela’s Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and the Person set forth on Schedule A
(“Stockholder”).

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Stockholder is the record or beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which meaning will apply for all purposes of this Agreement whenever the term
“beneficial owner” or “beneficially own” is used) of the number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Company
Common Stock”), of the Company, set forth opposite Stockholder’s name on Schedule A hereto (all shares of Company Common
Stock for which Stockholder is or becomes the record or beneficial owner prior to the termination of this Agreement being referred to
herein as the “Subject Shares”); and

WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date
hereof (the “Merger Agreement”), which provides, among other things, for the merger of Sub with and into the Company, with the
Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, a copy of which has been made available to Stockholder.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth below and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I
AGREEMENT TO VOTE

1.1 Agreement to Vote.

(a) Unless this Agreement shall have terminated pursuant to Section 4.2 (the date of such termination, the “Termination
Date”), at every meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock (the “Company Stockholders”), however called, and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof, or in any other circumstance in which the vote, consent or other approval of the Company
Stockholders is sought, Stockholder shall, or shall cause the holder of record on any applicable record date to, be present (in person or
by proxy) and vote (or consent to be voted by proxy or by executing and delivering a written consent) the Subject Shares (a) in favor of
(i) adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) approval of any proposal to adjourn or postpone the meeting to a later date, if there are not
sufficient votes for the adoption of the Merger Agreement on the date on which such meeting is held or (iii) any other matter
considered at any such meeting of the Company Stockholders which the board of directors of the Company has (A) determined is
necessary for the consummation of the Merger, (B) disclosed in the Proxy Statement or other written materials distributed to Company
Stockholders and (C) recommended that the Company Stockholders adopt; and (b) against (i) any proposal, action or agreement that
would (A) impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify any provision of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the Merger, (B) result in a
breach in any respect of any covenant, representation, warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company under the Merger
Agreement, (C) result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VI of the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled or (D) except as
expressly contemplated by the Merger

Agreement, change in any manner the dividend policy or capitalization of, including the voting rights of any class of capital stock of,
the Company, (ii) any Competing Proposal or proposal related to a Competing Proposal, (iii) any merger agreement or merger (other
than the Merger Agreement and the Merger), consolidation, combination, sale of substantial assets, reorganization, recapitalization,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or by the Company or (iv) against any change in the business, management or Board of
Directors of the Company (other than in connection with the transactions described in clause (a)(i) above) (clauses (b)(i) – (iv),
collectively, the “Covered Proposals”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) this Section 1.1 shall not apply during any period in which
this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to Section 4.2 but in which the Company’s board of directors has withheld,
withdrawn, modified, qualified or amended the Company Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event
in accordance with the Merger Agreement (provided that to the extent that the Company’s board of directors reinstates its
recommendation of the Merger Agreement, this Section 1.1 shall apply), (2) nothing in this Agreement shall require Stockholder to
vote or otherwise consent to any amendment to the Merger Agreement or the taking of any action that could result in the amendment,
modification or a waiver of a provision therein, in any such case, in a manner that (I) imposes any material restrictions or additional
material conditions on the consummation of the Merger or the payment of the Merger Consideration to Company Stockholders or (II)
extends the Outside Date, if, in each case, Stockholder has abstained from voting on or voted against such matter in Stockholder’s
capacity as a director of the Company, and (3) except as expressly set forth in this Section 1.1 with respect to Covered Proposals,
Stockholder shall not be restricted from voting in favor of, against or abstaining with respect to any other matter presented to the
Company Stockholders, including with respect to matters presented at any annual meeting of Company Stockholders. The Subject
Shares are owned of record by six charitable remainder unitrusts of which James Cabela is the sole Trustee and has sole voting and
investment power; such ownership and the payment of the income of the trusts to its income beneficiary do not violate the provisions
of this Agreement.

(b) Parent is including the following statement in the press release to be issued in connection with the announcement of the
Merger Agreement: “Bass Pro Shops appreciates and understands the deep ties between Cabela’s and the community of Sidney,
Nebraska. Dick, Mary and Jim Cabela founded their company in Sidney in 1961, and the company has flourished with its base of
operations there ever since. Bass Pro Shops intends to continue to maintain important bases of operations in Sidney and Lincoln and
hopes to continue the very favorable connections to those communities and the Cabela’s team members residing there.”

(c) SOLELY IN THE EVENT OF A FAILURE BY STOCKHOLDER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH
STOCKHOLDER’S OBLIGATIONS AS TO VOTING PURSUANT TO SECTION 1.1(A) PRIOR TO THE TERMINATION DATE,
STOCKHOLDER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY (UNTIL THE TERMINATION DATE) GRANTS TO AND APPOINTS PARENT
SUCH STOCKHOLDER’S PROXY AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT (WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION), FOR AND IN THE
NAME, PLACE AND STEAD OF STOCKHOLDER, TO REPRESENT, VOTE AND OTHERWISE ACT (BY VOTING AT ANY
MEETING OF COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS, BY WRITTEN CONSENT IN LIEU THEREOF OR OTHERWISE) WITH
RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT SHARES REGARDING THE MATTERS REFERRED TO IN SECTION 1.1(A) UNTIL THE
TERMINATION DATE, TO THE SAME EXTENT AND WITH THE SAME EFFECT AS STOCKHOLDER MIGHT OR COULD
DO UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE PROXY GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION
1.1(C) IS COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND SHALL BE IRREVOCABLE UNTIL THE TERMINATION DATE. UNTIL THE
TERMINATION DATE, STOCKHOLDER WILL TAKE SUCH FURTHER ACTION AND WILL EXECUTE SUCH OTHER
INSTRUMENTS AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE INTENT OF THIS PROXY. STOCKHOLDER HEREBY
REVOKES ANY AND ALL PREVIOUS PROXIES OR POWERS OF ATTORNEY GRANTED WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE
SUBJECT SHARES THAT MAY HAVE HERETOFORE BEEN APPOINTED OR GRANTED WITH RESPECT TO THE
MATTERS REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION 1.1, AND PRIOR TO THE TERMINATION DATE NO SUBSEQUENT PROXY
(WHETHER REVOCABLE OR IRREVOCABLE) OR POWER OF ATTORNEY SHALL BE GIVEN BY STOCKHOLDER,
EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY ANY ELECTION FORM OR LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS PROXY SHALL TERMINATE
UPON TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS.

1.2 No Inconsistent Arrangements. Except as provided hereunder or under the Merger Agreement, unless this Agreement shall
have terminated pursuant to Section 4.2, Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, (a) create or permit to exist any Lien on any
Subject Shares, other than restrictions imposed by applicable Law or pursuant to this Agreement or any risk of forfeiture with respect
to any shares of Company Common Stock granted to Stockholder under an employee benefit plan of the Company or otherwise that
would not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay or impair the consummation by Stockholder of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, “Permitted Liens”), (b) transfer, sell, assign, gift, hedge, pledge or otherwise dispose of (collectively,
“Transfer”), or enter into any contract or other arrangement with respect to any Transfer of the Subject Shares or any interest therein,
(c) prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, grant or permit the grant of any proxy, power of attorney or other authorization in or
with respect to the Subject Shares, (d) prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, grant or permit the grant of any proxy, power of
attorney or other authorization in or with respect to the Subject Shares, deposit or permit the deposit of the Subject Shares into a voting
trust or enter into a tender, support, voting or similar agreement or arrangement with respect to the Subject Shares, (e) tender the
Subject Shares to any tender offer or (f) otherwise take any action with respect to any of the Subject Shares that would restrict, limit or
interfere with the performance of any of Stockholder’s obligations under this Agreement or otherwise make any representation or
warranty of Stockholder contained herein untrue or incorrect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Stockholder may make Transfers of
Subject Shares (i) by will, (ii) by operation of Law, (iii) for estate planning purposes, (iv) for charitable purposes or as charitable gifts
or donations, (v) to any of its Affiliates or (vi) to fund a tax liability arising from the exercise or vesting of any equity incentives in the
Company held by Stockholder, including any withholding obligations, or to effect any net settlement, or to pay the exercise price in
respect, of any such equity incentives, in each of cases (i)-(v), the Subject Shares shall continue to be bound by this Agreement and
provided that each transferee thereof agrees in a writing reasonably acceptable to Parent to be bound by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (each a “Permitted Transfer”). For the avoidance of doubt, if Stockholder is not an individual, nothing in this Agreement
shall restrict any direct or indirect Transfers of any equity interests in Stockholder. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Stockholder may Transfer, or enter into any contract with respect to any Transfer of, all or
any portion of the Subject Shares at any time after the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained, and, if as a result of
such Transfer Stockholder ceases to be the record or beneficial owner of such Subject Shares, Stockholder shall have no obligations
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such Subject Shares.

1.3 Non-Solicitation. Unless this Agreement shall have terminated, Stockholder shall not take any action that would be a breach
of Section 5.03 of the Merger Agreement if taken by the Company.

1.4 No Exercise of Appraisal Rights. Stockholder hereby waives and agrees not to exercise any appraisal rights or right to dissent
in respect of the Subject Shares that may arise with respect to the Merger (under Section 262 of the DGCL or otherwise).

1.5 Documentation and Information. Until the Termination Date (unless this Agreement is terminated due to the occurrence of the
Effective Time), (a) Stockholder shall permit and hereby authorizes Parent and the Company to publish and disclose in all documents
and schedules filed with the SEC, and any press release or other disclosure document in connection with the Merger and any
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, a copy of this Agreement, Stockholder’s identity and ownership of the Subject
Shares and the nature of Stockholder’s commitments and obligations under this Agreement; and (b) Parent shall permit and hereby
authorizes Stockholder and its Affiliates, to the extent Stockholder or such Affiliates are required to do so by applicable Law, to publish
and disclose in all documents and schedules filed with the SEC (including any amendment to Stockholder’s schedule 13D), and any
press release or other disclosure document in connection with the Merger and any transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
a copy of this Agreement, Parent’s identity and the nature of Stockholder’s commitments and obligations under this Agreement.

and hereby does, authorize the Company or its counsel to notify the Company’s transfer agent that there is a stop transfer order with
respect to all of the Subject Shares (and that this Agreement places limits on the voting and transfer of such shares). The parties hereto
agree that such stop transfer order shall be removed and shall be of no further force and effect upon the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 4.2.

1.7 Subject Shares. Any additional Company Common Stock or other voting securities of the Company of which Stockholder
acquires record or beneficial ownership after the date hereof, including, without limitation, by purchase, as a result of a stock dividend,

writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against
whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege.

the other parties hereto, except that Parent and Sub may transfer or assign their rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole
or from time to time in part, to one or more of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries at any time; provided, however, such transfer or

Law of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction that would

of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington,
Delaware, or if such federal court does not have jurisdiction, any court of the State of Delaware having jurisdiction in respect of the

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Stockholder is the record or beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which meaning will apply for all purposes of this Agreement whenever the term
“beneficial owner” or “beneficially own” is used) of the number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Company

Stock for which Stockholder is or becomes the record or beneficial owner prior to the termination of this Agreement being referred to
herein as the “Subject Shares”); and

WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date

Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, a copy of which has been made available to Stockholder.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and

acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows:

the Company, (ii) any Competing Proposal or proposal related to a Competing Proposal, (iii) any merger agreement or merger (other
than the Merger Agreement and the Merger), consolidation, combination, sale of substantial assets, reorganization, recapitalization,

Directors of the Company (other than in connection with the transactions described in clause (a)(i) above) (clauses (b)(i) – (iv),
collectively, the “Covered Proposals”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) this Section 1.1 shall not apply during any period in which
this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to Section 4.2 but in which the Company’s board of directors has withheld,
withdrawn, modified, qualified or amended the Company Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event
in accordance with the Merger Agreement (provided that to the extent that the Company’s board of directors reinstates its
recommendation of the Merger Agreement, this Section 1.1 shall apply), (2) nothing in this Agreement shall require Stockholder to
vote or otherwise consent to any amendment to the Merger Agreement or the taking of any action that could result in the amendment,
modification or a waiver of a provision therein, in any such case, in a manner that (I) imposes any material restrictions or additional
material conditions on the consummation of the Merger or the payment of the Merger Consideration to Company Stockholders or (II)
extends the Outside Date, if, in each case, Stockholder has abstained from voting on or voted against such matter in Stockholder’s
capacity as a director of the Company, and (3) except as expressly set forth in this Section 1.1 with respect to Covered Proposals,
Stockholder shall not be restricted from voting in favor of, against or abstaining with respect to any other matter presented to the

(b) Parent is including the following statement in the press release to be issued in connection with the announcement of the
Merger Agreement: “Bass Pro Shops appreciates and understands the deep ties between Cabela’s and the community of Sidney,
Nebraska. Dick, Mary and Jim Cabela founded their company in Sidney in 1961, and the company has flourished with its base of
operations there ever since. Bass Pro Shops intends to continue to maintain important bases of operations in Sidney and Lincoln and
hopes to continue the very favorable connections to those communities and the Cabela’s team members residing there.”

(c) SOLELY IN THE EVENT OF A FAILURE BY STOCKHOLDER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH
STOCKHOLDER’S OBLIGATIONS AS TO VOTING PURSUANT TO SECTION 1.1(A) PRIOR TO THE TERMINATION DATE,
STOCKHOLDER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY (UNTIL THE TERMINATION DATE) GRANTS TO AND APPOINTS PARENT
SUCH STOCKHOLDER’S PROXY AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT (WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION), FOR AND IN THE
NAME, PLACE AND STEAD OF STOCKHOLDER, TO REPRESENT, VOTE AND OTHERWISE ACT (BY VOTING AT ANY
MEETING OF COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS, BY WRITTEN CONSENT IN LIEU THEREOF OR OTHERWISE) WITH
RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT SHARES REGARDING THE MATTERS REFERRED TO IN SECTION 1.1(A) UNTIL THE
TERMINATION DATE, TO THE SAME EXTENT AND WITH THE SAME EFFECT AS STOCKHOLDER MIGHT OR COULD
DO UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE PROXY GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION
1.1(C) IS COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND SHALL BE IRREVOCABLE UNTIL THE TERMINATION DATE. UNTIL THE
TERMINATION DATE, STOCKHOLDER WILL TAKE SUCH FURTHER ACTION AND WILL EXECUTE SUCH OTHER
INSTRUMENTS AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE INTENT OF THIS PROXY. STOCKHOLDER HEREBY
REVOKES ANY AND ALL PREVIOUS PROXIES OR POWERS OF ATTORNEY GRANTED WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE
SUBJECT SHARES THAT MAY HAVE HERETOFORE BEEN APPOINTED OR GRANTED WITH RESPECT TO THE
MATTERS REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION 1.1, AND PRIOR TO THE TERMINATION DATE NO SUBSEQUENT PROXY

EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY ANY ELECTION FORM OR LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL IN CONNECTION WITH THE
MERGER. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS PROXY SHALL TERMINATE UPON TERMINATION OF THIS
AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS.

1.2 No Inconsistent Arrangements. Except as provided hereunder or under the Merger Agreement, unless this Agreement shall
have terminated pursuant to Section 4.2, Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, (a) create or permit to exist any Lien on any
Subject Shares, other than restrictions imposed by applicable Law or pursuant to this Agreement or any risk of forfeiture with respect
to any shares of Company Common Stock granted to Stockholder under an employee benefit plan of the Company or otherwise that
would not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay or impair the consummation by Stockholder of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, “Permitted Liens”), (b) transfer, sell, assign, gift, hedge, pledge or otherwise dispose of (collectively,
“Transfer”), or enter into any contract or other arrangement with respect to any Transfer of the Subject Shares or any interest therein,
(c) prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, grant or permit the grant of any proxy, power of attorney or other authorization in or
with respect to the Subject Shares, (d) prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, grant or permit the grant of any proxy, power of
attorney or other authorization in or with respect to the Subject Shares, deposit or permit the deposit of the Subject Shares into a voting
trust or enter into a tender, support, voting or similar agreement or arrangement with respect to the Subject Shares, (e) tender the
Subject Shares to any tender offer or (f) otherwise take any action with respect to any of the Subject Shares that would restrict, limit or
interfere with the performance of any of Stockholder’s obligations under this Agreement or otherwise make any representation or
warranty of Stockholder contained herein untrue or incorrect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Stockholder may make Transfers of
Subject Shares (i) by will, (ii) by operation of Law, (iii) for estate planning purposes, (iv) for charitable purposes or as charitable gifts
or donations, (v) to any of its Affiliates or (vi) to fund a tax liability arising from the exercise or vesting of any equity incentives in the
Company held by Stockholder, including any withholding obligations, or to effect any net settlement, or to pay the exercise price in
respect, of any such equity incentives, in each of cases (i)-(v), the Subject Shares shall continue to be bound by this Agreement and
provided that each transferee thereof agrees in a writing reasonably acceptable to Parent to be bound by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (each a “Permitted Transfer”). For the avoidance of doubt, if Stockholder is not an individual, nothing in this Agreement
shall restrict any direct or indirect Transfers of any equity interests in Stockholder. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Stockholder may Transfer, or enter into any contract with respect to any Transfer of, all or
any portion of the Subject Shares at any time after the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained, and, if as a result of
such Transfer Stockholder ceases to be the record or beneficial owner of such Subject Shares, Stockholder shall have no obligations
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such Subject Shares.

1.3 Non-Solicitation. Unless this Agreement shall have terminated, Stockholder shall not take any action that would be a breach
of Section 5.03 of the Merger Agreement if taken by the Company.

1.4 No Exercise of Appraisal Rights. Stockholder hereby waives and agrees not to exercise any appraisal rights or right to dissent
in respect of the Subject Shares that may arise with respect to the Merger (under Section 262 of the DGCL or otherwise).

1.5 Documentation and Information. Until the Termination Date (unless this Agreement is terminated due to the occurrence of the
Effective Time), (a) Stockholder shall permit and hereby authorizes Parent and the Company to publish and disclose in all documents
and schedules filed with the SEC, and any press release or other disclosure document in connection with the Merger and any
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, a copy of this Agreement, Stockholder’s identity and ownership of the Subject
Shares and the nature of Stockholder’s commitments and obligations under this Agreement; and (b) Parent shall permit and hereby
authorizes Stockholder and its Affiliates, to the extent Stockholder or such Affiliates are required to do so by applicable Law, to publish
and disclose in all documents and schedules filed with the SEC (including any amendment to Stockholder’s schedule 13D), and any
press release or other disclosure document in connection with the Merger and any transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
a copy of this Agreement, Parent’s identity and the nature of Stockholder’s commitments and obligations under this Agreement.

and hereby does, authorize the Company or its counsel to notify the Company’s transfer agent that there is a stop transfer order with
respect to all of the Subject Shares (and that this Agreement places limits on the voting and transfer of such shares). The parties hereto
agree that such stop transfer order shall be removed and shall be of no further force and effect upon the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 4.2.

acquires record or beneficial ownership after the date hereof, including, without limitation, by purchase, as a result of a stock dividend,

securities, shall be deemed to be “Subject Shares” and this Agreement and the obligations hereunder shall automatically attach to such
shares of Company Common Stock.

Annex E

Opinion of Guggenheim Securities, LLC

April 17, 2017

The Board of Directors
Cabela’s Incorporated
One Cabela Drive
Sydney, Nebraska 69160

Members of the Board:

We understand that Cabela’s Incorporated (“Cabela’s”), Bass Pro Group, LLC (“Bass Pro”) and Prairie Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Bass Pro (“Merger Sub”), intend to enter into an Amendment to be dated as of April 17, 2017 (the “Amendment”)
to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 3, 2016 (the “Original Agreement” and as amended by the Amendment, the
“Agreement”), pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will merge (the “Merger”) with and into Cabela’s and Cabela’s will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Bass Pro and (ii) each of the outstanding shares of the Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Cabela’s (“Cabela’s Common Stock”) will be converted into the right to receive $61.50 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”), subject
to upward adjustment to up to $65.50 in cash under certain circumstances related to a termination of the Bank Framework Agreement
(as defined below) prior to consummation of the Merger (as to which adjustment we express no opinion) as set forth in the Agreement.

We also understand that a Framework Agreement (the “Bank Framework Agreement” and, together with the asset purchase, credit card
program, securitization transfer, transitional servicing, lease and other agreements contemplated by the Bank Framework Agreement,
the “Related Agreements”) is proposed to be entered into among Cabela’s, World’s Foremost Bank (“WFB”), Synovus Bank
(“Synovus”), Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“Capital One”) and, solely for purposes of certain provisions of the Bank
Framework Agreement, Capital One, National Association. We further understand that pursuant to and as otherwise contemplated by
the asset purchase agreements contemplated by the Bank Framework Agreement, (i) WFB will sell or otherwise dispose of certain
assets to Synovus and Capital One, and Synovus and Capital One will assume certain related liabilities, (ii) immediately following such
transactions, Synovus will sell or otherwise dispose of certain of such assets acquired from WFB to Capital One, and Capital One will
assume certain related liabilities and (iii) WFB will be merged with and into Cabela’s or one of its subsidiaries and the charter of WFB
will be terminated (the transactions described in clauses (i) through (iii), together with the other transactions contemplated by the
Agreement (other than the Merger) and the Related Agreements, the “Related Transactions”). The terms and conditions of the Merger
and the Related Transactions are more fully set forth in the Agreement and the Related Agreements.

You have asked us to render our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of Cabela’s
Common Stock is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

In the course of performing our reviews and analyses for rendering our opinion, we have:
 

 •  Reviewed the Original Agreement and a draft, provided to us on April 14, 2017, of the Amendment;
 

 •  Reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information regarding Cabela’s;
 

 
•  Reviewed certain non-public business and financial information regarding the businesses and prospects of Cabela’s,

including certain financial projections for Cabela’s for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 (the “Cabela’s Forecast”), all as
prepared and provided to us by the senior management of Cabela’s;

 

 
•  Discussed with the senior management of Cabela’s its strategic and financial rationale for the Merger and the Related

Transactions as well as its views of the businesses, operations, historical, current and projected financial results and future
prospects of Cabela’s and evolving industry dynamics related to Cabela’s;

 •  Reviewed the historical prices, trading multiples and trading activity of the shares of Cabela’s Common Stock;
 

 
•  Compared the financial performance of Cabela’s and the trading multiples of the shares of Cabela’s Common Stock with

corresponding data for certain other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant in evaluating Cabela’s;
 

 
•  Reviewed the valuation and financial metrics of certain mergers and acquisitions that we deemed relevant in evaluating the

Merger;
 

 •  Performed a discounted cash flow analysis for Cabela’s based on the Cabela’s Forecast; and
 

 •  Conducted such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as we deemed appropriate.

As the Board of Directors of Cabela’s is aware, we previously rendered an opinion, dated as of October 2, 2016 (the “Original
Opinion”), as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration contemplated by the Original Agreement. The
Original Opinion was based on, among other things, various financial analyses that were predicated on certain financial projections for
Cabela’s for the fiscal years 2016 through 2020 (the “Original Cabela’s Forecast”). We have been advised by the Board of Directors
and senior management of Cabela’s that the Original Cabela’s Forecast has been superseded in its entirety by the Cabela’s Forecast
and, accordingly, we have been directed by the Board of Directors and senior management of Cabela’s to rely exclusively on the
Cabela’s Forecast for purposes of our analyses and this opinion.

With respect to the information used in arriving at our opinion:
 

 

•  We have relied upon and assumed the accuracy, completeness and reasonableness of all industry, business, financial, legal,
regulatory, tax, accounting, actuarial and other information (including, without limitation, the Cabela’s Forecast and any
other estimates and other forward-looking information) furnished by or discussed with Cabela’s or obtained from public
sources, data suppliers and other third parties.

 

 

•  We (i) do not assume any responsibility, obligation or liability for the accuracy, completeness, reasonableness, achievability
or independent verification of, and we have not independently verified, any such information (including, without limitation,
the Cabela’s Forecast and any other estimates and other forward-looking information), (ii) express no view, opinion,
representation, guaranty or warranty (in each case, express or implied) regarding the reasonableness or achievability of the
Cabela’s Forecast and any other estimates and other forward-looking information or the assumptions upon which they are
based and (iii) have relied upon the assurances of the senior management of Cabela’s that it is unaware of any facts or
circumstances that would make such information (including, without limitation, the Cabela’s Forecast and any other
estimates and other forward-looking information) incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.

 

 

•  Specifically, with respect to (i) the Cabela’s Forecast and any other estimates and other forward-looking information relating
to Cabela’s furnished by or discussed with Cabela’s, (a) we have been advised by the senior management of Cabela’s, and
we have assumed, that the Cabela’s Forecast and such other estimates and other forward-looking information utilized in our
analyses have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
senior management of Cabela’s as to the expected future performance of Cabela’s and the corporate income tax rates
applicable to the Cabela’s Forecast and such other estimates and other forward-looking information and (b) we have
assumed that the Cabela’s Forecast and such other estimates and

other forward-looking information have been reviewed by the Board of Directors of Cabela’s with the understanding that
such information will be used and relied upon by us in connection with rendering our opinion and (ii) financial projections,
other estimates and/or other forward-looking information obtained by us from public sources, data suppliers and other third
parties, we have assumed that such information is reasonable and reliable.

Prior to Cabela’s entering into the Original Agreement, we were asked by the Board of Directors of Cabela’s to solicit indications of
interest from various third parties regarding a potential transaction with Cabela’s, and we have considered the results of such
solicitation in rendering our opinion.

In arriving at our opinion, we have not performed or obtained any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including any
contingent, derivative or off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Cabela’s or any other entity or the solvency or fair value of Cabela’s
or any other entity, nor have we been furnished with any such appraisals. We are not legal, regulatory, tax, consulting, accounting,
appraisal or actuarial experts and nothing in our opinion should be construed as constituting advice with respect to such matters;
accordingly, we have relied on the assessments of Cabela’s and its other advisors with respect to such matters. The senior management
of Cabela’s has advised us that all tax-affected financial projections (including, without limitation, the Cabela’s Forecast), other
estimates and other forward-looking information reflect the current US federal corporate income tax regime pursuant to the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; at the direction of the senior management of Cabela’s, we have not considered or analyzed the
impacts of any potential or proposed reform thereof in connection with our opinion and analyses. We are not expressing any view or
rendering any opinion regarding the tax consequences of the Merger or any Related Transactions to Cabela’s or its securityholders.

In rendering our opinion, we have assumed that, in all respects meaningful to our analyses, (i) the final executed form of the
Amendment will not differ from the draft that we have reviewed, (ii) Cabela’s, Bass Pro, Merger Sub and the other participants in the
Merger and the Related Transactions will comply with all material terms of the Agreement and the Related Agreements and (iii) the
representations and warranties of Cabela’s, Bass Pro, Merger Sub and the other participants in the Merger and the Related Transactions
contained in the Agreement and the Related Agreements are true and correct in all material respects and all conditions to the
obligations of each party to the Agreement and the Related Agreements to consummate the Merger and the Related Transactions will
be satisfied without any waiver, amendment or modification thereof. We also have assumed that the Merger and the Related
Transactions, as applicable, will be consummated in a timely manner and in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and the
Related Agreements and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements, without any delays, limitations,
restrictions, conditions, waivers, amendments or modifications (regulatory, tax-related or otherwise), including any divestiture or other
requirements, that would have an effect on Cabela’s, the Merger or the Related Transactions in any way meaningful to our analyses or
opinion.

In rendering our opinion, we do not express any view or opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the shares of Cabela’s
Common Stock or other securities of Cabela’s may trade or otherwise be transferable at any time, including subsequent to the
announcement or consummation of the Merger.

We have acted as a financial advisor to Cabela’s in connection with the Merger and will receive a customary fee for such services, a
substantial portion of which is contingent on successful consummation of the Merger. A portion of our compensation was payable upon
our engagement and a portion was payable upon delivery of the Original Opinion and will be credited against the fee payable upon
consummation of the Merger. In addition, Cabela’s has agreed to reimburse us for certain expenses and to indemnify us against certain
liabilities arising out of our engagement.

As the Board of Directors of Cabela’s is aware, aside from our current engagement as financial advisor to Cabela’s, during the past two
years, Guggenheim Securities, LLC (“Guggenheim Securities”) has not previously been engaged to provide investment banking or
financial advisory services to Cabela’s, Bass Pro, Capital One or Synovus, or Broad Street Principal Investments, L.L.C. or Pamplona
Capital Partners IV, L.P. as equity investors in Bass Pro in connection with the Merger, except that, in the first quarter of 2015,
Guggenheim Securities was engaged as financial advisor to Cabela’s in connection with the evaluation by Cabela’s of a potential
acquisition that Cabela’s elected not to pursue and in respect of which Guggenheim Securities did not receive any compensation. In
addition, Guggenheim Securities has provided financial advisory services on an informal basis to the senior management of Cabela’s
and members of the Board of Directors of Cabela’s during the past two years in connection with the assessment by Cabela’s of various
strategic and financial alternatives, including the Merger, for which services Guggenheim Securities did not receive any compensation
other than pursuant to our current engagement as financial advisor to Cabela’s. Guggenheim Securities may in the future seek to
provide investment banking or financial advisory services to Cabela’s, Bass Pro, other participants in the Merger or any Related
Transactions and their respective affiliates, for which services Guggenheim Securities would expect to receive compensation.

Guggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities engage in a wide range of financial services activities for our and their own
accounts and the accounts of our and their customers, including: asset, investment and wealth management; insurance services;
investment banking, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and restructuring; merchant banking; fixed income and equity sales,
trading and research; and derivatives, foreign exchange and futures. In the ordinary course of these activities, Guggenheim Securities
or its affiliates and related entities may provide such financial services to Cabela’s, Bass Pro, other participants in the Merger or any
Related Transactions or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio companies, for which services
Guggenheim Securities or its affiliates and related entities have received, and may receive, compensation. In 2015, Guggenheim
Securities participated as a broker in connection with certain stock repurchase programs of Cabela’s, for which services Guggenheim
Securities received customary brokerage commissions. Guggenheim Securities or its affiliates and related entities also may, directly or
indirectly, hold long or short positions, trade and otherwise conduct such activities in or with respect to certain bank debt, debt or
equity securities and derivative products of or relating to Cabela’s, Bass Pro, other participants in the Merger or any Related
Transactions or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio companies. Furthermore, Guggenheim Securities
or its affiliates and related entities and our or their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents may have
investments in Cabela’s, Bass Pro, other participants in the Merger or any Related Transactions or their respective affiliates,
subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio companies.

Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory guidelines, Guggenheim Securities has adopted certain policies and procedures to
establish and maintain the independence of its research departments and personnel. As a result, Guggenheim Securities’ research
analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and publish research reports with respect to Cabela’s, Bass
Pro, other participants in the Merger or any Related Transactions or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and
portfolio companies and the Merger and the Related Transactions that differ from the views of Guggenheim Securities’ investment
banking personnel.

Our opinion has been provided to the Board of Directors of Cabela’s (in its capacity as such) for its information and assistance in
connection with its evaluation of the Merger Consideration. Our opinion may not be disclosed publicly, made available to third parties
or reproduced, disseminated, quoted from or referred to at any time, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent; provided,
however, that this letter may be included in its entirety in any proxy statement on Schedule 14A to be distributed to holders of Cabela’s
Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

Annex F

Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law

§ 262. Appraisal rights.

(a)    Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery
of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As
used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean
and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited
with the depository.

(b)    Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to
paragraph (b) (3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1)    Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section
shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record
date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of
merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders;
and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a
merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in
§ 251(f) of this title.

(2)    Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger
or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything
except:

a.    Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts
in respect thereof;

b.    Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be
either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c.    Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and
b. of this section; or

d.    Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3)    In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or
§ 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of
the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4)    In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title,
appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the

procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable,
with the word “amendment” substituted for the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the
words “constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting corporation.”

(c)    Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for
the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation
in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the
certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and
(g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d)    Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1)    If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance
with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this
section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such
notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each
stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the
vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient
if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the
effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each
constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2)    If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within
10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled
to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of
such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by
§ 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice
did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall
send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of
stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or
(ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such
effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or,
in the case of a merger approved pursuant to

§ 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days
following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal
rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or
assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given
shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders
entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than
10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective
date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(e)    Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any
stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may
commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of
all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days
after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and
(d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with
respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement
shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under
subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial
owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name,
file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed
by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the
surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be
given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the
City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g)    At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who
have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and
who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the
constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss
the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless

(1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal,
(2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the
merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h)    After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in
accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such
proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines
otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the
date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum
of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest
theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled
to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final
determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or
resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is
not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts,
to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k)    From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as
provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the
effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time
provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written
withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after
the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of
the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding
in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s
