Your vote is very important.

September 19, 2016

Dear Shareholder:

On August 12, 2016, Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (“PWRR” or the “Company”) entered into a merger agreement
among the Company, Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (“G&W”) and Pullman Acquisition Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), providing for the acquisition
of the Company by G&W through the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “merger”), with the Company surviving the
merger. If completed, the merger will result in the Company becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of G&W.

On behalf of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”), you are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of shareholders,
which will be held at Union Station, Two Washington Square, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604, on Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 10:00
a.m., local time. At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the merger agreement and the
merger. At the special meeting, you will also be asked to vote on (1) a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with, or following the
completion of, the merger, (2) a proposal to adjourn the special meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger agreement, and (3) any other business properly brought before the
special meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof.

If the merger agreement is approved and the merger is subsequently completed, (i) each outstanding share of PWRR preferred stock,
par value $50.00 per share (the “preferred stock”), other than preferred stock held by a holder who is entitled to and makes a proper demand
for dissenters’ rights, will be deemed to be automatically converted, along with the aggregate accrued or accumulated and unpaid dividends
thereon, into 100 shares of PWRR common stock, par value $0.50 per share (the “common stock”) without any further action by the holders
of such preferred stock, and (ii) each share of common stock issued and outstanding at the effective time of the merger (including common
stock into which the preferred stock has been deemed converted, but excluding common stock owned by G&W or any of its direct or
indirect subsidiaries, including Merger Sub) shall, as of the effective time of the merger, be converted into and exchanged for the right to
receive cash in the amount of $25.00, without interest, per share of common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.

The merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the shares of preferred stock and a majority of the shares of common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, voting as separate classes and not together, approve the merger agreement,
including the plan of merger attached thereto. The Board (i) determined that the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger
and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the plan of merger, (iii) directed that the merger agreement be
submitted to the shareholders for approval and (iv) resolved to recommend that the shareholders approve the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the plan of merger. The Board recommends that shareholders
vote “FOR” approval of the merger agreement, the non-binding compensation proposal, and the adjournment proposal.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please
take the time to vote by completing the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage paid envelope, so that your shares may
be represented and voted at the meeting. If you attend the special meeting and vote in person, your vote by ballot will revoke any proxy
previously submitted. If you hold shares through a bank or broker, please use the voting instructions you have received from your bank or
broker. If you

sign, date and mail your proxy card without indicating how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote “FOR” approval
of the merger agreement and the other proposals. If you fail to vote, or you do not instruct your broker how to vote any shares held
for you in “street name,” it will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement but will
have no impact on the outcome of the other proposals.

The accompanying document serves as the proxy statement for the special meeting of our shareholders. This proxy statement
describes the special meeting, the merger, the documents related to the merger and other related matters. A copy of the merger agreement is
attached as Annex A to the accompanying proxy statement and incorporated therein by reference. We urge you to, and you should, read
this entire document carefully, including the merger agreement and the other annexes and the documents referred to or
incorporated by reference in the accompanying proxy statement. You may obtain additional information about PWRR from documents
we have filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Very truly yours,
 

Robert H. Eder,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the
merger or the other transactions described in this proxy statement, or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in
this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

This proxy statement is dated September 19, 2016 and is first being mailed to shareholders of the Company on or about September 21,
2016.

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
TO BE HELD ON OCTOBER 26, 2016

To the Shareholders of Providence and Worcester Railroad Company:

A special meeting of shareholders of Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (“PWRR,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”)
will be held at Union Station, Two Washington Square, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604, on Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 10:00 a.m.,
local time, for the following purposes:
 

 

1. To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Merger Agreement (as amended or modified from time to time, the “merger
agreement”) by and among the Company, Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (“G&W”) and Pullman Acquisition Sub Inc. (“Merger
Sub”), dated as of August 12, 2016 (including the plan of merger attached thereto), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge
with and into the Company (the “merger”), whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the
Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of G&W, which we refer to as the “merger proposal”;

 

 
2. To consider and vote upon an advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable

by the Company to our named executive officers in connection with, or following the completion of, the merger, which we refer
to as the “non-binding compensation proposal”;

 

 
3. To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting of the Company’s shareholders (the

“special meeting”), if necessary, to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting to approve the merger agreement, which we refer to as the “adjournment proposal”; and

 

 
4. To consider and act upon such other matters as may properly come before the special meeting or any adjournment or

postponement of that meeting.

The merger agreement and the proposed merger is more fully described in the attached proxy statement, which you should read
carefully and in its entirety before voting. A copy of the merger agreement is included as Annex A to the attached proxy statement.

The Company has established September 16, 2016 as the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote
at the special meeting, and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. Only record holders of PWRR common stock, par value $0.50 per
share (“common stock”) and PWRR preferred stock, par value $50.00 per share (“preferred stock”) as of the close of business on that date
will be entitled to vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of that meeting. The affirmative vote of (1) holders of a
majority of the shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting and (2) holders of a majority of the shares of
preferred stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, voting as separate classes and not together, is required to approve the

The PWRR board of directors (the “Board”) recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the non-binding
compensation proposal, and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

Under Rhode Island law, holders of preferred stock who do not, among other things, vote in favor of approval of the merger
agreement, and who properly exercise their dissenters’ rights, will have the right to make written demand for payment of the fair value of
their shares of preferred stock, but only if they strictly comply with the Rhode Island law procedures explained in the attached proxy
statement. The applicable Rhode Island law is reproduced in its entirety in Annex D attached to the accompanying proxy statement, and a
summary of

these provisions can be found under the section of the accompanying proxy statement titled “Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 68.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. All shareholders are cordially invited to attend the
special meeting. To ensure your representation at the special meeting of shareholders, please follow the voting procedures described
in the accompanying proxy statement and on the enclosed proxy card. This will not prevent you from voting in person, but it will help
to secure a quorum and allow your shares to be voted should anything prevent your attendance in person. If you attend the special meeting
and vote in person, your vote by ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted. Your proxy may be revoked at any time before it is
voted by following the procedures outlined in the accompanying proxy statement.

BY ORDER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Table of Contents

Recommendation of the Board of Directors (page 22)

At a meeting on August 12, 2016, after consulting with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor and after consideration of
various factors more fully described in this proxy statement, the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) (i) determined that the
merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair
to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the execution,
delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the
plan of merger, (iii) directed that the merger agreement be submitted to the shareholders for approval and (iv) resolved to
recommend that the shareholders approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
merger and the plan of merger. The Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the non-binding
compensation proposal, and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

Votes Required to Transact Business at the Special Meeting (page 22)

A quorum of the Company’s shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. If the holders of at least a majority of the total
number of the outstanding shares of each class of Company stock entitled to vote are represented in person or by proxy at the special
meeting, a quorum will exist. The Company will include proxies marked as abstentions in determining the presence of a quorum at the
special meeting.

The affirmative vote of (1) the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock, and (2) the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock, voting as separate classes and not together, is required to approve the
merger agreement. Additionally, the affirmative vote of (1) the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and (2) the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
preferred stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, voting as separate classes and not together, is required
to approve the non-binding compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal.

How to Vote Shares Held Directly by the Shareholder (page 23)

The Board requests that you vote your shares by returning the proxy card accompanying this document for use at the special
meeting. If you choose to vote by mail, please complete, date and sign the proxy card and promptly return it in the enclosed pre-paid
envelope. All properly signed proxies received prior to the special meeting and not revoked before the vote at the special meeting will
be voted at the special meeting according to the instructions indicated on the proxies or, if no instructions are given, to approve the
merger agreement, the non-binding compensation proposal, and the adjournment proposal. If you fail to submit a proxy or to vote in
person at the special meeting, or do not provide your broker, bank or other nominee with instructions, as applicable, your shares of
preferred stock or common stock, as applicable, will not be voted on the proposals, which will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the other proposals.

How to Vote Shares Held by a Broker, Bank or Other Nominee (page 24)

If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may vote your shares by completing, signing and dating the
voting instruction form provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee. You may also be able to vote your shares via telephone
or the internet in accordance with the instructions provided by your broker, bank or nominee. To be able to vote shares not registered in
your own name in person at the special meeting, you will need appropriate documentation from the record holder of your shares. If you
hold your shares in “street name” through a broker or bank, you may only vote or change your vote in person if you have a legal proxy

Revocation of Proxies (page 25)

If you have not voted through your broker, bank or other nominee, you may revoke your proxy at any time by taking any of the
following actions before your proxy is voted at the special meeting:
 

 
•  Timely filing a written revocation of the proxy with the Secretary and General Counsel of the Company, Charles D. Rennick,

Providence and Worcester Railroad Company, 75 Hammond Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01610;
 

 •  Timely submitting a new signed proxy card bearing a later date (any earlier proxies will be revoked automatically); or
 

 
•  Attending and voting in person at the special meeting provided you are the holder of record of your shares and have filed a

written revocation of your grant of proxy with the Secretary and General Counsel of the Company as indicated above.

If you have instructed a bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares, you must follow the directions you receive from your
bank, broker or other nominee to change your vote.

Stock Certificates (page 25)

As soon as practicable after the effective time of the merger, a paying agent will mail a letter of transmittal and instructions to you
and the other shareholders. The letter of transmittal and instructions will tell you how to surrender your stock certificates in exchange
for the merger consideration. Holders of uncertificated shares of common stock (i.e., holders whose shares are held in book-entry form)
will receive the merger consideration, without interest and subject to reduction for any required withholding taxes, as promptly as
practicable after the effective time of the merger without any further action required on the part of those holders, unless the paying
agent requires that such holders first deliver an executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent in order to receive the merger
consideration that such holder is entitled to receive.

Share Ownership of Management (page 26)

As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of the Company and their affiliates collectively beneficially owned
1,107,002 shares of common stock (excluding common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock) and 500 shares of
preferred stock, or approximately 22.7% of the outstanding common stock and approximately 78.1% of the outstanding preferred stock.

Voting Agreement (page 26)

The Robert H. Eder Trust and the Linda Eder Trust, which we refer to as the “Eder Trusts,” have executed a voting agreement with
G&W and the Company under which the Eder Trusts have agreed to vote their shares in favor of approving the merger agreement. As
of the record date, the Eder Trusts held 842,742 shares of common stock, representing approximately 17.3% of the outstanding shares
of common stock, and 500 shares of preferred stock, representing approximately 78.1% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock.

Delisting and Deregistration of Our Common Stock (page 43)

If the merger is completed, our common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of our common
stock.

The Merger

Structure of the Merger (page 50)

G&W, Merger Sub and the Company entered into the merger agreement on August 12, 2016. The merger agreement provides for
the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-
owned subsidiary of G&W.

The proposed merger will occur following approval of the merger proposal described in this document by the shareholders of the
Company (with holders of common stock and preferred stock each voting as a separate class) and satisfaction or waiver of all other
conditions to the merger. The merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. We encourage you to read the merger
agreement because it is the legal document that governs the merger.

Closing of the Merger (page 50)

We expect that the merger will be completed as soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of all closing conditions,
including approval of the merger agreement by each class of the Company’s shareholders at the special meeting and receipt of all
regulatory approvals. The parties cannot be certain whether or when any of the conditions to the merger will be satisfied, or waived
where permissible. We currently expect to complete the merger during the fourth calendar quarter of 2016; however, because the merger
is subject to these conditions, we cannot predict the actual timing, or whether the closing of the merger will occur at all.

Merger Consideration (page 50)

If the merger is completed, at the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of preferred stock immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger (other than shares of preferred stock held by shareholders who are entitled to demand and make
a proper demand for payment of the fair value of such preferred stock pursuant to such holders’ dissenters’ rights under Rhode Island
law) will be deemed to be automatically converted, along with the aggregate accrued or accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, into
100 shares of common stock (based on the existing conversion ratio of the preferred stock), without any further action by the holder of
such preferred stock or the Company, and each share of common stock (including common stock into which any preferred stock has
been deemed converted, but excluding shares that are owned by G&W or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, including Merger
Sub) will be canceled and will be converted automatically into the right to receive $25.00 in cash, without interest, less any applicable
withholding taxes.

Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards (page 51)

At the effective time of the merger, subject to all required withholding taxes:
 

 

•  each option to purchase common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, whether
vested or unvested, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of common stock underlying such unexercised stock option; and (y) the excess, if any, of $25.00 over the
exercise price per share provided in such option, without interest; and

 

 
•  each restricted stock unit, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the

merger will be canceled and will be converted automatically into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of
(x) the number of shares of common stock subject to such restricted stock unit and (y) $25.00, without interest.

Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor (page 36)

In connection with the merger, at the meeting of the Board on August 12, 2016, our financial advisor, BMO Capital Markets
Corp., which we refer to as “BMO,” rendered to the Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion
dated August 12, 2016, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of our common stock (other than the Eder
Trusts) as of that date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by BMO as set forth in its written opinion, of the merger consideration
per share of our common stock to be received by those holders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement.

The full text of BMO’s written opinion, dated August 12, 2016, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and is
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should read BMO’s opinion carefully and in its entirety for a
discussion of the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of
the review undertaken by BMO in rendering its opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
the opinion. BMO’s opinion was directed to the Board, in its capacity as the Board, and addressed only the fairness from a
financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, to the holders of our common stock (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
included the preferred stock on an as-converted basis), other than the Eder Trusts, of the consideration to be received by those
shareholders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement. The opinion did not address any other aspects or implications of
the merger and did not address the relative merits of the merger contemplated by the merger agreement as compared to other
business or financial strategies that might have been available, nor did it address the underlying business decision to enter into
the merger agreement or proceed with any other transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. BMO’s opinion was not
intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation as to how any holder of our common stock should vote at the
special meeting or take any other action with respect to the merger. For more information regarding our financial advisor, see the
section of this proxy statement titled “Proposal No. 1—The Merger—Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page
36.

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 44)

In considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve the merger agreement, you should be aware
that Company directors and executive officers may be deemed to have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to,
the interests of the Company’s shareholders generally and which may create potential conflicts of interest. The members of the Board
were aware of and considered these interests in reaching the determination to approve the merger agreement and deem the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to be advisable and in the best interests of the
Company, and in recommending that the Company’s shareholders vote for the approval of the merger agreement. These interests
include
 

 
•  each Company stock option and restricted stock unit, whether vested or unvested, will be canceled and converted into the

right to receive cash payments based on the merger consideration upon the effective time of the merger in accordance with
the terms of the merger agreement;

 

 

•  each of the Company’s executive officers (other than Robert H. Eder, our Chief Executive Officer) is party to a change in
control agreement with the Company that provides severance in the case of a termination of employment by the Company
without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason” in connection with or following a change in control, which will
include the completion of the merger; and

 

 
•  the Company’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the

merger agreement.

The merger agreement also provides that the Company’s executive officers immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
(excluding our Chief Executive Officer) will remain in office following the merger until their successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified. Please see the section of this proxy statement titled “Proposal No. 1—The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 44 for additional information about these financial interests.

Conditions to the Merger (page 52)

of the merger, of a number of conditions, including:
 

 
•  holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock, each voting separately as a

class, have approved the merger agreement and the plan of merger;
 

 
•  the absence of any order, decree or injunction in effect, or any law, statute or regulation enacted or adopted by any

governmental entity, that prevents or prohibits completion of the merger;

obligations on the merger (other than immaterial conditions or obligations and required labor protective conditions) or (ii) if
the STB has not issued a decision approving, authorizing or exempting the merger (or denying the requested approval,
authorization or exemption), then the STB has provided G&W with a written informal opinion that the proposed voting trust
submitted by G&W to the STB would insulate G&W from unauthorized control of the Company between the effective time
of the merger and receipt of final STB approval, authorization or exemption, as the case may be;

 

 
•  G&W and the Company having obtained any other regulatory approvals required to complete the transactions contemplated

by the merger agreement, and all related statutory waiting periods having expired;

•  each of G&W and the Company shall have delivered an officer’s certificate certifying that the conditions with respect to

accuracy of representations and warranties and compliance with obligations, agreements and covenants under the merger
agreement.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 54)

The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement abandoned
as follows:
 

 •  by mutual written consent of the Company and G&W;
 

 

•  by G&W or the Company, if any governmental entity issues a final, non-appealable order or takes any other action that
becomes final and non-appealable, or there exists any law, in each case, permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting the merger (so long as the party seeking termination has used reasonable best efforts to remove such order or
reverse such action);

regarding a proposal to acquire a significant interest in the Company.

Table of Contents

The Company has agreed that neither it nor its subsidiaries nor any of their representatives (as defined under the section of this
proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement—Limitations on Considering Other Acquisition Proposals; Non-Solicitation Provisions
and Exceptions” beginning on page 56) will, directly or indirectly:
 

 

•  solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, the making of any proposal that
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a takeover proposal (as defined under the section of this proxy statement titled
“The Merger Agreement—Limitations on Considering Other Acquisition Proposals; Non-Solicitation Provisions and
Exceptions” beginning on page 56) (other than contacting or engaging in discussions with the person making a takeover
proposal or its representatives for the sole purpose of clarifying such takeover proposal);

 

 
•  enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any

confidential information with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any takeover proposal; or
 

 

•  approve or recommend or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any takeover proposal, other than a permitted confidentiality
agreement (as described under the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement—Limitations on
Considering Other Acquisition Proposals; Non-Solicitation Provision and Exceptions” beginning on page 56).

However, if the Company receives a bona fide unsolicited written takeover proposal and the Company has not breached any of the non-
solicitation prohibitions in the merger agreement, the Board may furnish certain information with respect to the Company and its
subsidiaries to the third party making such takeover proposal and participate in discussions and negotiations regarding the unsolicited
takeover proposal under certain circumstances, as described under the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement—
Limitations on Considering Other Acquisition Proposals; Non-Solicitation Provisions and Exceptions” beginning on page 56.

The Company is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal unless it has complied
with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including engaging in good faith negotiations with G&W during a specified period. If
the Company terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal, it must pay a
$3,785,000 termination fee to G&W. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement—
Limitations on Considering Other Acquisition Proposals; Non-Solicitation Provisions and Exceptions” beginning on page 56.

In addition, the Company agreed that neither its Board nor any Board committee will:
 

 

•  withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to G&W), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
G&W), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board or any such committee of the merger
agreement, the plan of merger and the merger (or take any other action or make any other public statement inconsistent with
such recommendation);

 

 
•  recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly propose to recommend, approve or adopt, any

takeover proposal (together with the action in the immediately preceding bullet, an “adverse recommendation change”);
 

 

•  approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any takeover proposal, other than any permitted
confidentiality agreement; or

Table of Contents

unless, prior to receipt of our shareholders’ approval of the merger agreement and in response to a bona fide unsolicited written
takeover proposal, after consultation with its outside counsel, the Board determines that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, the
Board determines in good faith that the takeover proposal constitutes a superior proposal. In that event, the Company must provide
G&W with notice of such determination and cooperate and negotiate in good faith with G&W to adjust or modify the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 64)

To complete the merger and control the Company, G&W needs the prior approval or exemption of the STB. Prior to the special
meeting date, G&W will have filed all necessary applications, petitions or notices with the STB. On September 1, 2016, G&W filed a
petition for exemption with the STB requesting the prior approval of or exemption of the STB to complete the merger. On September
14, 2016, G&W also submitted a form of voting trust agreement to the STB seeking a written informal opinion that using a voting trust
arrangement would insulate G&W from having unauthorized control of the Company if (i) G&W has not received from the STB the
approval or exemption of the merger before the effective time of the merger and (ii) the stock of the surviving corporation is placed into
the voting trust immediately following the merger. G&W and the Company cannot predict, however, whether or when the required
regulatory approval or exemption will be obtained or whether any such approval or exemption will impose any burdensome condition
upon the parties.

Dissenters’ Rights (page 68)

The Company is organized as a corporation under Rhode Island law. Under the Rhode Island Business Corporation Act
(“RIBCA”), because the common stock is listed on the NASDAQ, holders of common stock who object to the merger do not have any
appraisal or dissenters’ rights. Holders of preferred stock, however, are entitled to demand the fair value of their preferred stock under
Section 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA. Holders of preferred stock who choose to exercise their dissenters’ rights must not vote in favor of
the merger and must strictly follow the other procedures set forth in Section 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA.

If a holder of preferred stock follows the required procedures, the preferred stock owned by such holder will not be deemed to be
automatically converted, along with the aggregate accrued or accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, into 100 shares of common
stock (based on the existing conversion ratio of the preferred stock), and such holder shall not have the right to receive cash in the
amount of $25.00 per share of common stock into which the preferred stock has been deemed converted. Instead, the shareholder’s only
right will be to receive the fair value of the preferred stock as determined pursuant to Section 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA, which could be
more, the same as, or less than the merger consideration per share of preferred stock that preferred shareholders would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement. A copy of Sections 7-1.2-1201 and 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex D and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. Failure to timely comply with the procedures set
forth in Section 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA will result in loss of a preferred shareholder’s dissenters’ rights.

Market Price of Our Common Stock (page 71)

Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ under the trading symbol “PWX”. The closing sale price of Company common stock
on the NASDAQ on August 12, 2016, which was the last trading day before we announced the merger, was $16.30. On September 16,
2016, the last trading day before the date of this proxy statement, the closing price of Company common stock on the NASDAQ was
$24.88.

Table of Contents

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences (page 74)

The receipt of cash for shares of Company stock pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for United States
federal income tax purposes. In general, if you are a U.S. Holder (as defined under “Material United States Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”), you will recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the
difference between the amount of cash received and your adjusted tax basis in your shares of common stock or preferred stock, as
applicable. Generally, any gain recognized upon the exchange will be capital gain, and any such capital gain will be long-term capital
gain if you have established a holding period of more than one year for your shares of Company stock.

Please review the information under “Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.” Tax matters are
complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend upon the facts of your particular situation. In addition, you may
be subject to state, local or foreign tax laws that are not discussed in this document. Accordingly, we strongly urge you to consult
your own tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences to you of the merger.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETING

The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the merger and the
special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a shareholder. To more fully
understand the merger and the special meeting, you should read this entire proxy statement, including the materials attached as annexes, as
well as the documents that have been incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.

 
Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
 

A: G&W and the Company have agreed to the acquisition of the Company by G&W under the terms of a merger agreement that is
described in this proxy statement. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. In order to complete
the merger, the holders of a majority of preferred stock and the holders of a majority of common stock, each voting as a separate class,
must approve the merger agreement. The Company will hold a special meeting of its shareholders to obtain these approvals. You are
receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation by the Board of proxies of the Company’s shareholders in favor of
the merger proposal.

You are also being asked to vote on a proposal to approve on an advisory (non-binding) basis the compensation that may be paid or
become payable by the Company to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with, or following the completion of, the
merger and on a proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary, to permit further solicitation of proxies if
there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger agreement.

This proxy statement contains important information about the merger, the merger agreement, the special meeting of the Company’s
shareholders, and other related matters, and you should read it carefully. The enclosed voting materials for the special meeting allow
you to vote your shares of preferred stock and/or shares of common stock without attending the special meeting. Your vote is very
important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy as soon as possible.

 
Q: What will happen in the merger?
 

A: In the proposed merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation and
becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of G&W.

 
Q: What will I receive in the merger?
 

A: If the merger agreement is approved and the merger is subsequently completed, you will be entitled to receive $25.00 in cash, without
interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common stock you own. If the merger is completed, each outstanding
share of preferred stock will be deemed to be automatically converted based upon its existing 100-for-1 conversion ratio, along with
the aggregate accrued or accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, into 100 shares of common stock, and each holder of preferred
stock will be entitled to receive $25.00 in cash for each share of common stock into which the preferred stock has been deemed
converted, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes.

For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock you will receive $2,500 in cash for your shares of common stock, less any
applicable withholding taxes, and if you own 10 shares of preferred stock, your 10 shares of preferred stock will be deemed converted
into 1,000 shares of common stock and you will receive $25,000 in cash in for your shares of preferred stock deemed converted into
common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes. You will not own any shares of the capital stock in the surviving corporation.

 
Q: What other effects will the merger have on the Company?
 

A: If the merger is completed, the common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and the
Company will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with

respect to the common stock, in each case, in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations. Following the completion of the
merger, the common stock will no longer be publicly traded and you will no longer have any interest in the Company’s future earnings
or growth.

 
Q: What are the material federal income tax consequences of the merger to me?
 

A: The receipt of cash for shares of Company stock pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for United
States federal income tax purposes. In general, if you are a U.S. Holder (as defined under “Material United States Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”), you will recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the
difference between the amount of cash received and your adjusted tax basis in your shares of common stock or preferred stock, as
applicable. Generally, any gain recognized upon the exchange will be capital gain, and any such capital gain will be long-term capital
gain if you have established a holding period of more than one year for your shares of Company stock.

This tax treatment may not apply to all the Company’s shareholders. We strongly urge you to review the information under
“Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” and consult your own tax advisor for a full
understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to you.

 
Q: What are the conditions to completion of the merger?
 

A: The obligations of G&W and the Company to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing
conditions contained in the merger agreement, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval of the merger
agreement by a majority of the holders of preferred stock and the holders of common stock, each voting as a separate class.

 
Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?
 

A: We will complete the merger when all of the conditions to completion contained in the merger agreement are satisfied or waived.
Some of these conditions, such as the receipt of required regulatory approvals, are not entirely within our control. We currently expect
to complete the merger during the fourth calendar quarter of 2016 assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions;
however, because the merger is subject to these conditions, we cannot predict the actual timing and we cannot guarantee that the
merger will be completed.

 
Q: When and where is the special meeting?
 

A: The special meeting of shareholders of the Company will be held at Union Station located at Two Washington Square, Worcester,
Massachusetts 01604, on Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 10:00 a.m., local time.

 
Q: What will happen at the special meeting?
 

A: At the special meeting, the Company’s shareholders will consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the merger agreement and the
non-binding compensation proposal. If, at the time of the special meeting, there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger
agreement, we may ask you to consider and vote upon the adjournment proposal, so that we can solicit additional proxies.
Shareholders may also be asked to consider and act upon such other matters as may properly come before the special meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof.

 
Q: Who can vote at the special meeting?
 

A: Holders of record of the Company’s preferred stock or common stock at the close of business on September 16, 2016 which is the
record date for the special meeting, are entitled to notice of the special

meeting and to vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 4,866,593 shares of common
stock and 640 shares of preferred stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of common stock and
preferred stock is entitled to one vote per share on each matter properly brought before the special meeting. The common stock and the
preferred stock are voting as separate classes on the proposals to be considered at the special meeting.

 
Q: What constitutes a quorum for the special meeting?
 

A. A quorum will be present if holders of record of a majority of the shares of preferred stock and a majority of the shares of common
stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If a
quorum is not present at the special meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is
obtained. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 4,866,593 shares of common stock and 640 shares of preferred
stock outstanding. Accordingly, 2,433,297 shares of common stock and 321 shares of preferred stock must be present or represented
by proxy at the special meeting to constitute a quorum.

 
Q: What shareholder approvals are required to complete the merger?
 

A: Approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of (1) holders of at least a majority of the shares of common stock
outstanding at the close of business on the record date for the special meeting, and (2) holders of at least a majority of the shares of
preferred stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date for the special meeting, voting as separate classes and not
together. A failure to vote your shares of common stock or preferred stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement. Note that you may vote to approve the merger agreement and vote
not to approve the non-binding compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal and vice versa.

 
Q: What shareholder vote is required to approve the other proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting?
 

A. Each of the non-binding compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of
the shares of common stock and a majority of the shares of preferred stock, each voting as separate classes and not together, cast for or
against that proposal at the special meeting. Failures to vote and “broker non-votes” will have no effect on the outcome of the non-
binding compensation proposal or adjournment proposal. However, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
non-binding compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. If less than a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock
and preferred stock entitled to vote are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, a majority of the shares of
each class present or represented at the meeting, each voting as a separate class, may also adjourn the meeting under the Company’s
bylaws.

 
Q: Are there any shareholders already committed to voting in favor of the merger agreement?
 

A: Yes. The Eder Trusts have entered into a voting agreement with G&W and the Company requiring them to vote all of their shares in
favor of approval of the merger agreement. These shareholders collectively held approximately 78.1% of the outstanding shares of
preferred stock and 17.3% of the outstanding shares of common stock on the record date.

 
Q: Does the Board recommend voting in favor of the merger agreement?
 

A: Yes. After careful consideration of various factors and after consulting with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, the Board
recommends that the Company’s shareholders vote “FOR” approval of the merger agreement. The Board also recommends that
shareholders vote “FOR” approval of the non-binding compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

Table of Contents

Q: Do any of the Company’s directors or executive officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of the
Company’s shareholders generally?

 

A: Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger proposal, you should be aware that our directors and
executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company’s
shareholders generally. During its consideration of the merger, the Board was aware of and considered there interests, as described in
the section of this proxy statement titled “Proposal No.1—The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”
beginning on page 44.

 
Q: Why am I being asked to approve the non-binding compensation proposal?
 

A: SEC rules require the Company to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain categories of compensation that may be
provided to named executive officers in connection with a merger transaction.

 
Q: What will happen if the shareholders do not approve the non-binding compensation proposal?
 

A: Approval of the compensation that may be paid or become payable in connection with, or following completion of, the merger is not a
condition to completion of the merger. The vote with respect to the compensation that may be paid or become payable is an advisory
vote and will not be binding on the Company. Therefore, if shareholders approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement by the
requisite majorities and the merger is completed, the payments that are the subject of the vote may become payable to the named
executive officers regardless of the outcome of such vote.

 
Q: What will happen if the merger is not completed?
 

A: If the merger agreement is not approved by the Company’s shareholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, the
Company’s shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock or preferred stock. Instead, the Company will
remain an independent public company, the Company’s common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ and
registered under the Exchange Act, and the Company will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.

Under specified circumstances, the Company may be required to pay G&W a termination fee of $3,785,000 upon the termination of
the merger agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement titled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee” beginning
on page 55.

 
Q: What will happen to my stock options and restricted stock unit awards under the Company’s Equity Plans?
 

A: If the merger is completed, any stock option you hold, whether or not vested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger and which has not been exercised or canceled, will be canceled in exchange for your right to receive a lump sum
cash payment equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of (i) the $25.00 per share merger consideration, without interest, over (ii)
the per share exercise price for such option and (b) the total number of shares of common stock underlying such option, less applicable
taxes required to be withheld.

If the merger is completed, any restricted stock unit award, whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, will be canceled in exchange for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (i)
the $25.00 per share merger consideration, without interest, and (ii) the number of shares of common stock subject to such restricted
stock unit award, less applicable taxes required to be withheld.

 
Q: What if I participate in the Company’s Profit-Sharing Plan or Employee Stock Purchase Plan?
 

A: If you are a participant in the Providence and Worcester Railroad Company Profit-Sharing Plan (which we refer to as the “Profit-
Sharing Plan”), your proxy will serve as voting instructions for your shares of

common stock held in the Profit-Sharing Plan as of the record date. Participants in the Profit-Sharing Plan may direct the trustee of the
Profit-Sharing Plan as to how to vote shares allocated to their Profit-Sharing Plan account. The cutoff date for voting for participants
in the Profit-Sharing Plan is the close of business on October 24, 2016. If you do not provide voting instructions, the trustee will not
vote shares allocated to your Profit-Sharing Plan account.

If you are a participant in the Providence and Worcester Railroad Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan (which we refer to as the
“ESPP”), you should have received a proxy statement and proxy for shares of common stock purchased under the ESPP. Although
these shares are uncertificated, they are registered on the Company’s books in your name as “book-entry shares” and you have the
right to vote such shares to the same extent, and in the same manner, as any other shares that you own.

See the section of this proxy statement titled “The Special Meeting of the Shareholders—Shares Held in the PWRR Profit-Sharing
Plan” beginning on page 26 and the section titled “The Special Meeting of the Shareholders—Shares Purchased Under the PWRR
Employee Stock Purchase Plan” beginning on page 26 of this proxy statement.

 
Q: How may I vote my shares for the special meeting proposals presented in this proxy statement?
 

A: You may vote by completing, signing, dating and returning the proxy card in the enclosed prepaid return envelope as soon as possible.
This will enable your shares to be represented and voted at the special meeting. Proxy cards mailed by holders of record must be
received prior to 10:00 a.m. on October 26, 2016, in order to be counted in the vote.

 
Q: If my shares are held in “street name” by my broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker, bank or other nominee

automatically vote my shares for me?
 

A: No. Your broker, bank or other nominee will not vote your shares unless you provide instructions to your broker, bank or other
nominee on how to vote. It is important that you provide timely instruction to your broker or bank to ensure that all shares of
Company stock that you own are voted at the special meeting. You should fill out the voter instruction form sent to you by your
broker, bank or other nominee with this proxy statement.

 
Q: What if I fail to return my proxy card or to instruct my broker, bank or other nominee?
 

A: If you fail to return your proxy card or to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be
voted. This will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” approval of the merger agreement. Failures to vote and “broker non-
votes” will have no effect on the outcome of the other proposals.

 
Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: You should carefully read and consider the information contained or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement, including its
annexes. It contains important information about the merger, the merger agreement, and the Company. After you have read and
considered this information, shareholders are requested to vote by mail or by attending the special meeting and voting in person. If you
choose to vote by mail, you should complete, sign and date your proxy card and return it in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope
as soon as possible so that your shares of Company stock will be represented and voted at the special meeting. The proxy card will
instruct the persons named on the proxy card to vote your shares at the special meeting as you direct. If you sign and send in a proxy
card and do not indicate how you wish to vote, the proxy will be voted “FOR” all of the special meeting proposals.

Table of Contents

Q. What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

A. You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or
voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting
instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold the shares. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and
voting instruction card that you receive, or otherwise follow the voting instructions set forth on the proxy card and voting instruction
card.

 
Q: Can I attend the special meeting and vote my shares in person?
 

A: Yes. Although the Board requests that you vote your shares by mail in advance of the special meeting, all of the Company’s
shareholders are invited to attend the special meeting. Shareholders of record on September 16, 2016 may vote in person at the special
meeting. If your shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, then you are not the shareholder of record and you must bring to
the special meeting appropriate documentation from your broker, bank or other nominee to enable you to vote at the special meeting.

 
Q: Can I change my vote after I have submitted a proxy?
 

A: Yes. If you have not voted through your broker, bank or other nominee, there are three ways you can change your vote at any time
after you have sent in your proxy card and before your proxy is voted at the special meeting:

 

 
•  You may file a timely written revocation of the proxy with the Secretary and General Counsel of the Company, Charles D.

Rennick, Providence and Worcester Railroad Company, 75 Hammond Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01610;
 

 •  You may timely submit a new signed proxy card bearing a later date (any earlier proxies will be revoked automatically); or
 

 
•  You may attend the special meeting and vote in person provided that you are the holder of record of your shares and have filed a

written revocation of your grant of proxy with the Secretary and General Counsel of the Company as indicated above.

If you have instructed a bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares, you must follow the directions you receive from your bank,
broker or other nominee to change your vote.

 
Q: What happens if I sell my shares after the record date but before the special meeting?
 

A: The record date of the special meeting is earlier than both the date of the special meeting and the date that the merger is expected to be
completed. If you sell or otherwise transfer your Company shares after the record date but before the date of the special meeting, you
will retain your right to vote at the special meeting unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you
and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies the Company in writing of such special
arrangements, but you will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration if the merger is completed to the person to whom you
transferred your shares. In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares through completion of the merger.

 
Q: Am I entitled to exercise dissenters’ rights instead of receiving the merger consideration for my shares?
 

A: Under Rhode Island corporate law, because the common stock is listed on the NASDAQ, holders of common stock who object to the
merger do not have any appraisal or dissenters’ rights. Holders of preferred

stock are entitled to certain dissenters’ rights under Rhode Island law as long as they follow the procedures precisely and satisfy
certain conditions, which are described in the proxy statement under the section titled “Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 68.
Failure to strictly comply with the statutory requirements may result in your waiver of, or inability to exercise, dissenters’ rights.

 
Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?
 

A: No. You will receive separate written instructions for surrendering your shares of common stock or preferred stock in exchange for the
merger consideration. In the meantime, you should retain your stock certificate(s) because they are still valid. Please do not send in
your stock certificate(s) with your proxy card.

 
Q: Whom should I call with questions?
 

A: If you have questions about the merger or the special meeting, or if you need additional copies of this proxy statement or the enclosed
proxy card, you should contact the Company’s Investor Relations Contact, Wendy Lavely, at (508) 755-4000, ext. 365.

quorum will exist. The Company will include proxies marked as abstentions in determining the presence of a quorum at the special meeting.

The merger cannot be completed unless the merger agreement is approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
common stock and a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, voting as separate classes
and not together. If the Company’s shareholders fail to approve the merger proposal, the merger will not occur. Additionally, the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of common stock and the holders of at least a majority of the shares of preferred stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, voting as separate classes and not together, is required to approve the non-
binding compensation proposal and to approve the adjournment proposal.

Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Shares Entitled to Vote

You can vote at the special meeting if you owned common stock or preferred stock at the close of business on September 16, 2016, the
record date for the special meeting. As of the close of business on September 16, 2016, there were 4,866,593 shares of common stock
outstanding and 640 shares of preferred stock outstanding. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common
stock that he, she or it owned as of the record date. Each holder of preferred stock is entitled to one vote for each share of preferred stock
that he, she or it owned as of the record date.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors

The Board has (i) determined that the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger and other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, (ii)
approved and declared advisable the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the merger and the plan of merger, (iii) directed that the merger agreement be submitted to the
shareholders for approval, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the shareholders approve the merger agreement and the

transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the plan of merger. The Board believes the merger agreement is fair to
the Company’s shareholders and is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders and recommends that you vote your shares as
follows:
 

 •  “FOR” Proposal No. 1 regarding the approval of the merger agreement;
 

 •  “FOR” Proposal No. 2 regarding the non-binding compensation proposal; and
 

 •  “FOR” Proposal No. 3 regarding the adjournment proposal.

See the section of this proxy statement titled “Proposal No. 1—The Merger—Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons
for the Merger” beginning on page 32.

Votes Required to Approve Each Proposal

Approval of the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)

Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock and the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock, voting as separate classes and not together. If you do
not vote, either in person or by proxy, it will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” approval of the merger agreement. If your shares
are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, such failure
to instruct your nominee will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

Approval of the Non-Binding Compensation Proposal (Proposal 2)

Approval of the non-binding compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of common stock present in
person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of preferred stock present in person
or represented by proxy at the special meeting, voting as separate classes and not together. Because this proposal is advisory, it will not be
binding upon the Board if approved regardless of whether the merger agreement is approved. Accordingly, because the Company is
contractually obligated to pay the compensation if the merger agreement is approved by the Company’s shareholders and the merger is
completed, the compensation will be payable, subject to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on the non-
binding compensation proposal. Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, failures to vote and “broker non-votes” will have no
effect on the outcome of the non-binding compensation proposal.

Approval of the Adjournment Proposal (Proposal 3)

Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting, and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of preferred stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting, voting as separate classes and not together. Failures to vote and “broker non-votes” will have
no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal. If less than a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock
entitled to vote are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, a majority of the shares of each class present or
represented at the meeting, each voting as a separate class, may also adjourn the meeting under the Company’s bylaws.

How to Vote Shares Held Directly by the Shareholder

If you are the record holder of your shares, you may vote your shares by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and
returning it in the enclosed postage paid envelope. Proxy cards mailed by holders of record must be received prior to 10:00 a.m. on October
26, 2016, in order to be counted in the vote. If you are the shareholder of record, you may also vote your shares in person at the special
meeting. Returning a proxy card will not prevent you from voting your shares in person if you attend the special meeting.

Table of Contents

If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the special meeting. Please note,
however, that if your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the special meeting, you must
bring additional documentation from the broker, bank or other nominee in order to vote your shares.

How to Vote Shares Held by a Broker, Bank or Other Nominee

If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may vote your shares by completing, signing and dating the
voting instruction form provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee. You may also be able to vote your shares via telephone or
the internet in accordance with the instructions provided by your broker, bank or nominee. To be able to vote shares not registered in your
own name in person at the special meeting, you will need appropriate documentation from the record holder of your shares. If you hold your
shares in “street name” through a broker or bank, you may only vote or change your vote in person if you have a legal proxy in your name
from your broker or bank.

Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions

If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” by a broker and you do not give instructions to the broker on how to
vote your shares at the special meeting, your broker may not vote your shares with respect to any of the proposals. Proxies submitted by a
broker that do not exercise this voting authority are also known as “broker non-votes.”

An abstention is a decision by a shareholder to take a neutral position on a proposal being submitted to shareholders at a meeting,
although taking a neutral position through an abstention is considered a vote cast on a proposal being submitted at a meeting as described in
the section below titled “—Effect of Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions on Quorum and the Votes Required at the Special Meeting.”

Effect of Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions on Quorum and the Votes Required at the Special Meeting

Abstentions will be included in determining the presence of a quorum at the special meeting. Broker non-votes will not be included in
determining the presence of a quorum at the special meeting.

Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement,
which requires the favorable vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock, voting as a class, and of holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock, voting as a class. Broker non-votes will not have any impact on the outcome of the
other proposals. However, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the non-binding compensation proposal and the
adjournment proposal, which require the favorable vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by
proxy at the special meeting and the favorable vote of a majority of the shares of preferred stock present in person or represented by proxy
at the special meeting.

How Will Shares be Voted

All shares represented by valid unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions on the proxy card. If you return a
signed proxy card, but make no specification on the card as to how you want your shares voted, your proxy will be voted “FOR” approval
of the foregoing proposals. The Board is presently unaware of any other matter that may be presented for action at the special meeting of
shareholders. If any other matter does properly come before the special meeting, the Board intends that shares represented by properly
submitted proxies will be voted, or not voted, by and at the discretion of the persons named as proxies on the proxy card.

Table of Contents

Revocation of Proxies

A proxy may be revoked at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by:
 

 
•  Filing a timely written revocation of the proxy with the Secretary and General Counsel of the Company, Charles D. Rennick,

Providence and Worcester Railroad Company, 75 Hammond Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01610;
 

 •  Submitting a timely new signed proxy card bearing a later date (any earlier proxies will be revoked automatically); or
 

 
•  Attending and voting in person at the special meeting provided you are the holder of record of your shares and have filed a

written revocation of your grant of proxy with the Secretary and General Counsel of the Company as indicated above.

If you hold your shares in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to contact your nominee in order to revoke your
proxy. If you hold your shares in street name through a broker or bank, you may only change your vote in person if you have a legal proxy
in your name from your broker or bank.

Proxy Solicitation

The Board is soliciting these proxies. The Company will pay the expenses of soliciting proxies to be voted at the special meeting. In
addition to sending you this proxy statement, some of the Company’s directors and executive officers as well as management and non-
management employees may contact you by telephone, mail, e-mail, or in person. We may ask brokerage houses and other custodians and
nominees whether other persons are beneficial owners of the Company stock. If so, we will reimburse banks, nominees, fiduciaries, brokers
and other custodians for their costs of sending the proxy materials to the beneficial owners of the Company stock.

Dissenters’ Rights

The Company is organized as a corporation under Rhode Island law. Under Rhode Island corporate law, because the common stock is
listed on the NASDAQ, holders of common stock who object to the merger do not have any appraisal or dissenters’ rights. Holders of
preferred stock who are entitled to demand, and make proper demand, for payment of the fair value of such preferred stock pursuant to the
provisions of Section 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such preferred stock. See the section of this
proxy statement titled “Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 68 for further information regarding dissenters’ rights under the RIBCA.

Stock Certificates

You should not send in any certificates representing the Company stock at this time. As soon as practicable after the effective time of
the merger, a paying agent will mail a letter of transmittal and instructions to you and the other shareholders. The letter of transmittal and
instructions will tell you how to surrender your stock certificates in exchange for the merger consideration. Holders of uncertificated shares
of common stock (i.e., holders whose shares are held in book-entry form) will receive the merger consideration, without interest and subject
to reduction for any required withholding taxes, as promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger without any further action
required on the part of those holders, unless the paying agent requires that such holders first deliver an executed letter of transmittal to the
paying agent in order to receive the merger consideration that such holder is entitled to receive.

Proposal to Approve Adjournment of the Special Meeting

The Company is also submitting a proposal for consideration at the special meeting to authorize the named proxies to approve the
adjournment of the special meeting if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting. Even
though a quorum may be present at the special meeting, it is

Table of Contents

possible that the Company may not have received sufficient votes to approve the merger agreement by the time of the special meeting. In
that event, we would need to adjourn the special meeting in order to solicit additional proxies. The adjournment proposal relates only to an
adjournment of the special meeting for purposes of soliciting additional proxies to obtain the requisite shareholder approval to approve the
merger agreement.

To allow the proxies that have been received by the Company at the time of the special meeting to be voted for an adjournment, if
necessary, the Company is submitting a proposal to approve the adjournment, only under those circumstances, to you for consideration. If
the new date, time and place is announced at the special meeting before the adjournment, the Company is not required to give notice of the
time and place of the adjourned meeting, unless the Board fixes a new record date for the special meeting.

The adjournment proposal relates only to an adjournment of the special meeting occurring for purposes of soliciting additional proxies
for approval of the merger agreement proposal in the event that there are insufficient votes to approve that proposal. Under the Company
bylaws, if a quorum is not present at a meeting of the shareholders, the shareholders present in person or represented by proxy, have the
power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting.

Share Ownership of Management

As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of the Company and their affiliates collectively beneficially owned
1,107,002 shares of common stock (excluding common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock) and 500 shares of preferred
stock, or approximately 22.7% of the outstanding common stock and approximately 78.1% of the outstanding preferred stock. We currently
expect that each of these individuals will vote all of his or her shares of common stock and preferred stock in favor of each of the proposals
to be presented at the special meeting, although none of them other than Mr. Eder are obligated to do so. See the section of this proxy
statement titled “Certain Beneficial Owners of Common Stock and Preferred Stock” beginning on page 76 for further information regarding
the common stock and preferred stock owned by directors and executive officers of the Company and their affiliates.

Voting Agreement

The Eder Trusts have executed a voting agreement with G&W and the Company under which the Eder Trusts have agreed to vote their
shares in favor of approving the merger agreement. As of the record date, the Eder Trusts held 842,742 shares of common stock,
representing approximately 17.3% of the outstanding shares of common stock, and 500 shares of preferred stock, representing
approximately 78.1% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock. See the section of this proxy statement titled “The Voting Agreement”
beginning on page 72 for further information regarding the voting agreement.

Shares Held in the PWRR Profit-Sharing Plan

If you are a participant in the Profit-Sharing Plan, your proxy will serve as voting instructions for your shares of common stock held in
the Profit-Sharing Plan as of the record date. Participants in the Profit-Sharing Plan may direct the trustee of the Profit-Sharing Plan as to
how to vote shares allocated to their Profit-Sharing Plan account. The cutoff date for voting for participants in the Profit-Sharing Plan is the
close of business on October 24, 2016. If you do not provide voting instructions, the trustee will not vote shares allocated to your Profit-
Sharing Plan account.

Shares Purchased Under the PWRR Employee Stock Purchase Plan

If you are a participant in the ESPP, you should have received a proxy statement and proxy for shares of common stock purchased
under the ESPP. Shares purchased under the ESPP are subject to a two-year restriction on transfer from the date of purchase. Although these
shares are uncertificated, they are registered on the Company’s books in your name as “book-entry shares” and you have the right to vote
such shares to the same extent, and in the same manner, as any other shares that you own.

PROPOSAL NO. 1—THE MERGER

General

Under the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the
Company being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of G&W. At the effective time of the merger, each
share of preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, other than preferred stock held by a holder who is
entitled to and makes a proper demand for dissenters’ rights, shall be deemed to be automatically converted, along with the aggregate
accrued or accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, into 100 shares of common stock (based on the existing conversion ratio of the
preferred stock), without any further action by the holder of such preferred stock or the Company. At the effective time of the merger, each
share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (including any preferred stock deemed
to be converted into common stock, but excluding shares that are owned by G&W or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, including
Merger Sub) will be canceled and will be converted automatically into the right to receive $25.00 in cash, without interest.

Background of the Merger

In the fourth quarter of 2015, Robert H. Eder (the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) and Frank K. Rogers (the
Company’s Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer) met with one of the Company’s Class I rail partners (“Party A”) to discuss joint
commercial opportunities. During the meeting, Party A suggested possible joint venture arrangements and expressed some interest in
acquiring equity in the Company to further develop strategic opportunities and enhance regional connectivity. Upon receiving a report of
this meeting, in recognition of its public company obligations, the Board appointed a subcommittee of two independent directors, Frank W.
Barrett and Richard W. Anderson, to interview potential investment bankers to represent the Company in possible negotiations with Party A
and to assist the Board in evaluating additional strategic options for the realization of shareholder value, including potential change in
control transactions. The subcommittee interviewed several investment banking firms, including Greene Holcomb & Fisher LLC (the
business of which was subsequently acquired by BMO Capital Markets Corp. and which we refer to as “GHF” prior to such acquisition and
“BMO” thereafter). During the executive session of the Board’s regular quarterly meeting held on January 27, 2016 (which Director Alfred
P. Smith did not attend), the subcommittee recommended to the Board that the Company retain GHF as its investment banking firm. At that
meeting, representatives of GHF discussed with the Board its qualifications and a proposed process should the directors ultimately decide to
proceed with a change in control transaction. As part of the interview process, GHF represented to the Company that it would not represent
any potential buyer of the Company in connection with an offer to purchase the Company or any person proposing to provide financing in
connection with such an offer. Following this presentation, the Board approved the subcommittee’s recommendation and the Company
engaged GHF. In selecting GHF, the Board considered, among other things, the fact that GHF was a reputable investment banking firm with
substantial experience advising companies in the rail sector and in providing strategic advisory services in general, GHF had recent
experience providing strategic advisory services in connection with the sale of a short-line railroad and, in the Board’s opinion, GHF would
commit appropriate attention, resources and personnel to the process.

At a special meeting of the Board held on March 14, 2016, representatives of GHF discussed their evaluation of the Company’s
business operations and strategy for improving operational and financial performance, as well as railroad industry dynamics more generally
and their impact on current railroad valuations. Representatives of GHF then proposed a process pursuant to which the Company would
proceed with discussions with Party A and also solicit interest from other potential third parties regarding a change in control transaction.
The Board considered various factors, including the marketplace, the risks attendant to engaging in the process discussed with
representatives of GHF, the Company’s overall strategic position, and the challenges attendant to improving the Company’s financial
performance in order to maximize shareholder value and concluded, based upon its examination of these and other factors, that it was in the
best interest of the Company

and its shareholders to proceed with the transaction strategy discussed with representatives of GHF. In light of the potentially significant
time and effort involved in pursuing such exploratory transaction strategy, as well as the possible need to provide guidance to GHF and
management on short notice, at the conclusion of the meeting, the Board appointed a special committee of independent directors of the
Board (which we refer to as the “Transaction Committee”), composed of Frank W. Barrett (Chair), Richard W. Anderson and James C.
Garvey, for the purpose of assisting in the supervision and oversight of the process on the full Board’s behalf and making a recommendation
to the full Board. The Transaction Committee did not have the authority to approve or enter into a change of control transaction, which,
under Rhode Island law, is an authority that can only be exercised by the full Board. At the time of appointment, Messrs. Barrett and Garvey
had been elected by the preferred shareholders and Mr. Anderson had been elected by the common shareholders at the 2015 annual
shareholders meeting. At the Company’s 2016 annual shareholders meeting on April 27, 2016, Messrs. Barrett and Anderson were re-
elected as directors by the common shareholders and Mr. Garvey was re-elected as a director by the preferred shareholders.

On March 22, 2016 and March 23, 2016, Daniel T. Noreck (the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer) and other members
of the senior management team of the Company met with various representatives of Party A.

On March 24, 2016, the Transaction Committee met by telephone conference to discuss the results of management’s meeting with
Party A and to discuss next steps in the process. Members of management and representatives of each of GHF and the Company’s legal
counsel, Hinckley, Allen & Snyder LLP (which we refer to as “Hinckley Allen”), participated in all meetings of the Transaction Committee,
except as otherwise indicated. At this meeting, Mr. Noreck reported that he and other members of the senior management team had met with
various representatives of Party A on March 22 and 23, 2016 and had informed Party A of GHF’s engagement. The Transaction Committee
authorized GHF to contact Party A as well as other potential buyers to determine their level of interest in a change in control transaction.
During the week of March 28, 2016, in accordance with the Transaction Committee’s directives, representatives of GHF contacted 11
potential strategic buyers (including Party A) and 18 potential financial buyers. Each of the potential strategic buyers and 14 potential
financial buyers subsequently executed confidentiality agreements. The confidentiality agreements did not contain any “standstill” or
similar provision that would prohibit a potential buyer from submitting a proposal or making an offer to acquire the Company.

Between April 3, 2016 and April 6, 2016, representatives of GHF and members of the Company’s management held a series of
introductory meetings with five potential strategic buyers (including G&W) at the American Short Line and Regional Railroad
Association’s 2016 Connections Convention (“2016 Connections Convention”).

On April 7, 2016, the Transaction Committee met by telephone conference and discussed the process to date with representatives of
GHF. Representatives of GHF reported that they and Company management had held a series of introductory meetings with five potential
strategic buyers (including G&W) at the 2016 Connections Convention. Mr. Noreck reported that the Company had also approached two
additional Class I railroads to determine their interest in a possible transaction. After discussion, the Transaction Committee authorized
representatives of GHF, on behalf of the Company, to contact each of the five interested parties with whom management had met at the
2016 Connections Convention, as well as other potential strategic buyers (including certain Class I railroads) and private equity firms who
had entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company to confirm their continuing interest. Subsequently, on April 21, 2016, the
Company and representatives of GHF held an introductory meeting with another potential strategic buyer (“Party B”).

With the assistance of GHF, the Company prepared a memorandum concerning the Company and its prospects, which was distributed
to the potential buyers, including Party A, Party B and G&W, that had executed confidentiality agreements. The Transaction Committee met
with representatives of GHF by telephone conference on April 22, 2016 and discussed the status of discussions with potential buyers. On
April 27, 2016,

the Board met in executive session (without Mr. Eder present) with representatives of GHF and discussed the status of the process,
including that each potential buyer had been advised to submit a non-binding indication of interest by May 10, 2016 (which deadline was
subsequently postponed to May 19, 2016 to ensure the potential buyers had sufficient time to formulate their most compelling offers).

Between May 19, 2016 and June 1, 2016, the Company received nine written indications of interest (“IOIs”) from potential buyers,
with offer prices per share ranging from $17.93 to $26.50 (assuming the conversion of preferred stock into common stock), implying equity
values of $90 million to $134 million. The Transaction Committee met by telephone conference on May 23, 2016 and again on June 1, 2016
to consider the IOIs. In view of the substantial amount of management time that would be required for management presentations, the
Transaction Committee concluded that the two low bidders should be excluded from that process. The Transaction Committee authorized
representatives of GHF to schedule in-person management presentations with the remaining seven potential buyers and allow these parties
to conduct additional due diligence. These potential buyers were given access to an internet data site to conduct legal and financial due
diligence.

In mid-June 2016, at the direction of the Transaction Committee, representatives of GHF instructed all potential buyers to submit non-
binding letters of intent (“LOIs”) by July 20, 2016, together with mark-ups of the forms of merger agreement, disclosure letter and voting
agreement, which GHF indicated would be posted to the internet data site. Potential buyers were instructed to provide a valuation for the
Company based on the purchase of 100% of the outstanding common stock on a dollar per share basis (assuming conversion of the
preferred stock into common stock) or the financial terms of any non-cash proposal.

On June 29, 2016, the Company posted an initial draft of merger agreement to the internet data site, and on June 30, 2016, the
Company posted an initial draft of voting agreement with respect to the common stock and preferred stock held by the Eder Trusts. On July
11, 2016, the Company posted an initial draft of disclosure letter to the internet data site.

Over the course of June and July 2016, each of the potential buyers and their respective advisors engaged in due diligence of the
Company’s business and financial condition, including holding meetings with certain members of the Company’s management team. The
Transaction Committee met on June 30, 2016 to receive a status update on the management presentations and due diligence efforts of the
potential buyers. In early July 2016, a potential strategic buyer that had not previously been part of the process (“Party C”) approached the
Company’s management and expressed interest in acquiring the Company. After executing a confidentiality agreement, Party C was
provided the memorandum concerning the Company provided to the other potential buyers. On July 12, 2016, Party C submitted an IOI
with an offer price per share of $21.00 (implying an equity value of $108 million). Subsequently, Party C was provided access to the
internet data site and the Company’s management held a management presentation with Party C by telephone on July 14, 2016.

In late July 2016, the Company received six LOIs with offer prices per share ranging from $19.20 to $24.00 (implying equity values of
$96 million to $121 million). Party B, G&W and another bidder (“Party D”) also provided mark-ups of the draft merger agreement and
voting agreement. One bidder (“Party E”) provided a summary of material issues and proposed changes to the merger agreement and voting
agreement with respect to those issues.
 

 •  Party B submitted an LOI to acquire the Company for a price of $24.00 per share (subject to an expedited diligence review).
 

 

•  G&W submitted an LOI on July 21, 2016 to acquire the Company for a price of $21.15 per share (subject to a three-week
exclusive diligence period). The price included $20.02 cash at closing and $1.13 in the form of a contingent value right, the value
of which was based on the subsequent sale of the Company’s South Quay property (“CVR”). G&W also provided a mark-up of
the disclosure letter. On July 26, 2016, in response to feedback from representatives of GHF indicating its price and CVR
structure were not competitive, G&W submitted a revised LOI, which increased its offer to $22.15 per share (including $21.02 in
cash and $1.13 CVR).

Table of Contents

 
•  Party E (a strategic buyer) submitted an LOI to acquire the Company for a price of $21.26 per share (subject to a 60-day

exclusivity period for due diligence and negotiation of definitive documentation).
 

 
•  Party D (a financial buyer) submitted an LOI to acquire the Company for a price of $21.00 per share (subject to a four-week

diligence period).
 

 •  Party C submitted an LOI to acquire the Company for a price of $19.30 per share (subject to a 30-day diligence period).
 

 
•  Party F (a strategic buyer) submitted an LOI to acquire the Company for a price of $19.20 per share (subject to a 30-day due

diligence period).

In addition to various due diligence requirements, the LOI prices were based on different assumptions and requirements related to
transaction expenses and change in control payments, which GHF and the Transaction Committee observed could affect the ultimate offer
price. One strategic buyer and one financial buyer elected not to submit an LOI.

The Transaction Committee met by telephone conference on July 22, 2016 and in person after the regular quarterly Board meeting on
July 27, 2016, to review the LOIs with representatives of GHF. Representatives of GHF reviewed the material financial terms of each LOI,
including the offer price, and additional due diligence requested. The Transaction Committee discussed the process for the on-site due
diligence requested by the bidders, the delays inherent in managing on-site due diligence by multiple parties and the difficulties of
maintaining the confidentiality of the discussions. The Transaction Committee concluded that the Company should proceed with
confirmatory due diligence and negotiations with G&W and Party B because of the higher offers made by each of G&W and Party B
relative to the other potential buyers. At the direction of the Transaction Committee, representatives of GHF subsequently contacted the
remaining bidders to inform them that they were no longer involved in the process. The Transaction Committee updated the independent
directors (other than Director Smith) regarding the process at a meeting held immediately prior to the Board’s regular quarterly meeting on
July 27, 2016. Director Smith is Vice President and Group Executive, Locomotive Group of GATX Corporation (“GATX”), which owns
4.92% of the Company’s common stock. In order to avoid any potential conflict, Mr. Smith elected to recuse himself from participating in
this and other Board meetings at which the bidding process and any potential transaction were to be discussed because of the possibility that
GATX might be a potential buyer of the Company.

On July 29, 2016, representatives of GHF had calls with Party D and Party E. During those calls, Party D and Party E both expressed
interest in reengaging and enhancing their offers. On August 1, 2016, Party D submitted a revised LOI at a price of $24.00 per share and
Party E submitted a revised LOI, along with financing support, from Party F, at a price of $23.81 per share. Both revised proposals
contained a 30-day due diligence period. The Transaction Committee convened by telephone conference on August 1, 2016, to consider the
revised LOIs submitted by Party D and Party E and subsequently directed representatives of BMO (which acquired the business of GHF on
August 1, 2016) to clarify certain elements of the revised proposals and the bidders’ respective due diligence requirements. Party E
withdrew its revised proposal on August 2, 2016 (but confirmed its original proposal of $21.26 per share) and Party D declined to shorten
its due diligence period and requested that the Company commit that it would not enter into an agreement with another bidder during its
30-day due diligence period. In light of the active interest of Party B and G&W, the Company declined to make such a commitment, at
which point Party D indicated that it would not proceed with further due diligence at that time.

On August 1, 2016, Hinckley Allen provided Party B with a revised merger agreement and voting agreement, reflecting changes from
the marked-up documents included with Party B’s LOI. On August 3, 2016, Hinckley Allen provided G&W with a revised merger
agreement and voting agreement, reflecting changes from the marked-up documents included with G&W’s LOI. On August 3, 2016, the
Company and Hinckley Allen also responded to additional due diligence questions submitted by Party B. On August 4, 2016, the
Transaction Committee met by conference call to discuss the process with representatives of BMO and Hinckley Allen on the

status of negotiations and due diligence. During that discussion, the Transaction Committee directed the management team and
representatives of each of BMO and Hinckley Allen to continue diligence and negotiations with both G&W and Party B, but given the
higher price offered by Party B, to prioritize Party B and proceed to complete the negotiation of the merger agreement with Party B. From
July 27, 2016 through August 11, 2016, Party B and G&W conducted on-site financial, legal and environmental due diligence, including hi-
rail trips to inspect the Company’s track infrastructure.

On August 4, 2016, legal counsel for Party B provided a revised draft of the merger agreement and, following negotiations between
their respective legal counsels, the Company provided Party B with a revised draft of the merger agreement and disclosure letter on August
5, 2016. On August 9, 2016, the Transaction Committee met by telephone conference to review the status of the negotiations and due
diligence. Following that discussion, the Transaction Committee directed representatives of BMO to inform G&W that the Company
intended to enter into a merger agreement with another bidder. G&W requested that it be allowed to continue its due diligence, including
physical due diligence on August 10 and August 11, 2016, to potentially facilitate an improved offer, which request was granted. On August
10, 2016, representatives of Hinckley Allen and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (which we refer to as “Simpson Thacher”), G&W’s legal
counsel, discussed various provisions of the draft merger agreement and voting agreement that had been provided to G&W on August 3,
2016, and Hinckley Allen provided Simpson Thacher with a revised disclosure letter to accompany the August 3 draft merger agreement.
On August 11, 2016, G&W indicated its possible intention to submit a revised LOI on August 12, 2016, having just completed its physical
diligence of the Company’s track infrastructure.

Based upon progress made in due diligence and the negotiations with Party B during the week of August 8, 2016, meetings of the
Transaction Committee and Board were scheduled for August 12, 2016 in anticipation of reviewing final agreements and approving a
transaction with Party B. On the morning of August 12, 2016, following a discussion between representatives of BMO and G&W in which
G&W indicated it would be submitting a revised LOI, G&W submitted a revised LOI to acquire the Company for a price of $25.00 per
share in cash, which excluded the previously proposed CVR, together with mark-ups of the merger agreement and the voting agreement.
G&W’s LOI further indicated that the offer would expire at 6:00 p.m. on the following day. Later that day, Simpson Thacher submitted a
mark-up of the disclosure letter. Upon receipt of the revised LOI and related merger documents, Hinckley Allen and Simpson Thacher
negotiated revisions to the merger agreement and disclosure letter. The Transaction Committee met at 10:30 a.m. on August 12, 2016, and
reviewed the status of the negotiations and merger documents with both Party B and G&W. Following that discussion, the Transaction
Committee directed representatives of BMO to inform Party B that another party had submitted a revised LOI at a higher price.

On the afternoon of August 12, 2016, following the meeting of the Transaction Committee, the Board held a special meeting to review
and consider the recommendation of the Transaction Committee with respect to a potential sale transaction. All directors were present in
person or by telephone other than Director Smith. The Transaction Committee reported on the process and the status of the negotiations
with Party B and G&W. Drafts of the Party B merger agreement, voting agreement and disclosure letter and drafts of the G&W merger
agreement, voting agreement and disclosure letter were provided to the directors at the meeting. Hinckley Allen reviewed the material terms
of the draft merger agreements provided by Party B and G&W, and the differences between the G&W draft merger agreement and the Party
B draft merger agreement. Hinckley Allen also reviewed the Board’s fiduciary obligations in connection with the proposed transaction and
responded to questions from the directors. Hinckley Allen advised the Board that both Party B’s and G&W’s draft merger agreements
restricted the Company from soliciting a competing proposal, subject to a “fiduciary out” for an unsolicited superior proposal, which
required the Company to pay a termination fee equal to 3% of the transaction value in the case of G&W (which the Company had
negotiated down from 3.85%) and 3% plus Party B’s transaction expenses (capped at 1% of transaction value) in the case of Party B, in the
event the merger agreement was terminated as a result of the Board’s decision to pursue such a proposal.

Hinckley Allen advised the Board that the draft merger agreement and disclosure letter for both Party B and G&W had minor
differences but were substantively the same, except for the following: (1) the price offered by

G&W was $1.00 more per share; (2) the termination fee payable by the Company in the event the Board exercised its “fiduciary out” in
order to accept a superior proposal was less under the G&W draft agreement than the Party B draft agreement; and (3) the STB approval
process for G&W and Party B would be different since G&W owned connecting railroads. The Board arranged a telephone call with the
Company’s STB counsel to discuss the process for obtaining the required regulatory approval or exemption for the transaction, the risks
associated with each process, the use of a voting trust to enable an earlier closing of the transaction (as contemplated by the G&W merger
agreement) and the likely timeframe for obtaining any regulatory clearance for a transaction with either Party B or G&W. Based upon that
discussion, the Board determined that the timeframe for, and the likelihood of, obtaining the required regulatory approval was not materially
different for a transaction with G&W versus a transaction with Party B. At the request of the Board, representatives of BMO then contacted
Party B to determine if it would increase its offer price. Party B indicated that it would not increase its price.

The Board determined that the G&W offer represented the superior proposal. At the request of the Board, representatives of BMO
reviewed BMO’s financial analyses supporting its opinion to the Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
our common stock of the consideration to be received by those holders (other than the Eder Trusts) in the merger pursuant to the merger
agreement as of August 12, 2016. At the request of the Board, BMO confirmed that it did not have any existing or contemplated material
relationships with G&W in connection with the provision of any financial advisory or financing services to G&W. BMO then rendered an
oral opinion to the Board, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated August 12, 2016 to the effect that, as of that date,
and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on
the scope of review undertaken by BMO as set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the holders of our
common stock in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to those holders (other than the Eder
Trusts). Following a discussion of the terms of the merger agreement and related matters, the Board (other than Director Smith, who recused
himself from the August 12, 2016 meeting) (i) determined that the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger and other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, (ii)
approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the plan of
merger, (iii) directed that the merger agreement be submitted to the Company’s shareholders for approval and (iv) resolved to recommend
that the Company’s shareholders approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the
plan of merger.

Shortly thereafter, Hinckley Allen and Simpson Thacher finalized the transaction documents and the Company and G&W executed the
merger agreement, and the Company, G&W and the Eder Trusts executed the voting agreement. The Company issued a press release
publicly announcing the transaction on Monday, August 15, 2016 prior to the opening of trading of the Company’s common stock on the
NASDAQ.

Subsequent to the delivery of BMO’s opinion and the Board’s approval of the merger agreement and voting agreement, representatives
of BMO advised the Board that when checking to determine if there were any financial advisory or financing relationships with G&W, it
had inadvertently failed to identify that a BMO affiliate has a participation in G&W’s existing secured syndicated debt facility as described
under the section titled “Summary of Financial Analysis of BMO Capital Markets Corp.—Miscellaneous” on page 41. On September 6,
2016, the Board considered this new information, determined this relationship was not material to BMO’s independence and confirmed that
the Board remained comfortable with the engagement and opinion of BMO.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger

In its evaluation of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, the Board reviewed and
discussed the transaction with the Company’s management and legal and financial advisors. In determining that the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the

merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders and reaching its conclusion to approve the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the merger and the plan of merger), the Board considered a number
of factors, including, among others, the following:
 

 

•  the Board’s knowledge of the current and prospective environment in which the Company operates, including national and local
economic conditions, the competitive environment, the Company’s overall strategic position, the increasing capital requirements
to maintain the Company’s track infrastructure, and the challenges attendant to improving the Company’s financial performance
in order to maximize shareholder value and the likely effect of these factors on the Company’s potential growth, development,
profitability and strategic options;

 

 
•  the Board’s understanding of the Company’s business, operations, management, financial condition, safety culture, earnings and

prospects;
 

 

•  the Board’s assessment of the strategic and financial alternatives reasonably available to the Company (including remaining an
independent company), and the potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties associated with those alternatives, none of
which were deemed likely to result in value to the Company’s shareholders that would exceed, on a present-value basis, the value
of the merger consideration;

 

 

•  the fact that the Company conducted a lengthy and thorough process, directed by the Board and the Transaction Committee,
during which the Board sought offers to purchase from a broad group of potential bidders, including strategic and financial
buyers, 25 of whom entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company and received information related to the Company
and six of whom submitted non-binding letters of intent;

 

 
•  the review by the Board with the Company’s management and advisors of the structure of the merger and the financial and other

terms of the merger agreement, including the merger consideration in relation to the current market price of the Company’s
common stock and the historical, present and anticipated future operating results and financial position of the Company;

 

 
•  based on the Board’s review of the process conducted by the Transaction Committee, the Board’s belief that $25.00 per share in

cash and the terms of the merger agreement offer the best value reasonably attainable for the Company’s shareholders;
 

 
•  the fact that the value of the merger consideration of $25.00 per share in cash represents a 53% premium over the per share

closing price of the Company’s common stock of $16.30 on August 12, 2016, the last trading day concluded prior to the
Company and G&W entering into the merger agreement;

 

 
•  the fact that the merger consideration would be paid solely in cash, which, compared to non-cash consideration, provides

certainty and immediate liquidity and value to our shareholders, enabling our shareholders to realize value that has been created
at the Company while eliminating long-term business and execution risk;

 

 
•  the fact that the merger agreement was the product of arm’s—length negotiations and contained terms and conditions that were,

in the Board’s view, advisable and favorable to the Company and its shareholders;
 

 
•  the timing of the merger and the risk that if the Company did not accept G&W’s offer at the time that it did, the Board might not

have had another opportunity to do so;
 

 
•  the fact that the merger is subject to the approval of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding

shares of the Company’s common stock and preferred stock, each voting separately as a class, entitled to vote thereon;
 

 •  the terms of the merger agreement and the related agreements, including:
 

 •  the limited number and nature of the conditions to G&W’s obligation to consummate the merger;

•  the Company’s ability, prior to the time that the Company’s shareholders approve the merger agreement and plan of
merger, to discuss and negotiate, under specified circumstances, an unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal should
one be made and, if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that the
unsolicited bona fide written takeover proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a superior proposal and that
the failure to pursue such superior proposal would be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law,
the Board is permitted to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement for that superior
proposal, subject to certain notice requirements, “matching rights” and payment of a termination fee of $3.785 million to
G&W;

 

 

•  the belief of the Board that, although the termination fee might have the effect of discouraging competing third-party
proposals, such provisions are customary for transactions of this type, and the Board determined that the $3.785 million
termination fee was reasonable in light of, among other things, the benefits of the merger to the Company’s shareholders,
the typical size of such fees in similar transactions and the likelihood that a fee of such size would not preclude or
unreasonably restrict the emergence of alternative takeover proposals;

 

 

•  the Board’s ability, prior to the time that the Company’s shareholders approve the merger agreement and plan of merger,
to change or withdraw its recommendation of the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal or any positive
change, event, or occurrence with respect to the Company’s business that becomes known to the Board and was not
known to the Board when the merger agreement was entered into, in each case, if the Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to change or withdraw its recommendation would be
inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to certain notice requirements and “matching
rights”;

 

 •  the likelihood that the merger will be completed, based on, among other things:
 

 
•  the absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement and the representation of G&W in the merger agreement as

to its financial wherewithal;
 

 
•  the conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement, which are customary in number and scope, and which, in the

case of the condition related to the accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties, are generally subject to a
“Company Material Adverse Effect” qualification;

 

 

•  the likelihood that the regulatory and shareholder approvals needed to complete the merger will be obtained in a timely
fashion and the agreement of G&W in the merger agreement to seek STB approval to close into a voting trust, if
necessary, to ensure that the merger can be completed as promptly as possible and ensure that the risk of regulatory delays
is not borne by the Company or its shareholders;

 

 

•  the financial analysis reviewed by representatives of BMO with the Board as well as the oral opinion of BMO rendered to the
Board, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated August 12, 2016, to the effect that as of that
date, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications
and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by BMO as set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration to be
received by the holders of our common stock in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of
view, to those holders (other than the Eder Trusts), as more fully described below under “Proposal No. 1—The Merger—Opinion
of the Company’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 36; and

 

 •  the experience and reputation of G&W in completing transactions of this type.

Table of Contents

The Board also considered a variety of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger agreement and the
merger, including, among others, the following:
 

 •  the challenges associated with seeking the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in a timely manner;
 

 

•  the significant costs associated with entering into the merger agreement and completing the merger, the substantial time and
effort of management required to complete the merger, the potential for diversion of management and employee attention, and
for employee attrition, during the period prior to the completion of the merger and the potential effect on the Company’s business
and relations with customers, service providers and other stakeholders, whether or not the merger is completed;

 

 
•  the requirement that the Company conduct its business in the ordinary course and the other restrictions on the conduct of the

Company’s business prior to completion of the merger, which may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business
opportunities that may arise pending completion of the merger;

 

 
•  the possibility, though unlikely from the Company’s perspective, that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the

merger will not be satisfied, and as a result, it is possible that the merger does not close (including as a result of events outside of
either party’s control), even if the merger agreement is approved by the Company’s shareholders;

 

 •  the fact that the Company will lose the autonomy associated with being an independent railroad;
 

 
•  the fact that the shareholders will have no ongoing equity participation in the Company following the merger, and that such

shareholders will cease to participate in the Company’s future earnings or growth, if any, and will not participate in any potential
future sale of the Company to a third party;

 

 
•  the fact that certain provisions of the merger agreement prohibit the Company from soliciting, and limit its ability to respond to,

proposals for alternative transactions;
 

 

•  the fact that the merger agreement entitles G&W to terminate the merger agreement if, among other things, the Company
commences negotiations regarding an alternative acquisition proposal in material breach of the non-solicitation prohibitions
under the merger agreement, and obligates the Company to pay to G&W a termination fee of $3.785 million (approximately 3%
of the transaction value) if the Company recommends or accepts an alternative acquisition proposal, which may deter others
from proposing an alternative transaction that may be more advantageous to the Company’s shareholders; and

 

 
•  the receipt of cash by shareholders in exchange for their common stock and preferred stock pursuant to the merger will be a

taxable transaction to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not exhaustive, but includes all material factors considered
by the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the Board in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the
complexity of these matters, the Board did not consider it practical to, nor did it attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative
weights to the specific factors that it considered in reaching its decision. The Board evaluated the factors described above with the
Company’s management and legal and financial advisors. In considering the factors described above, individual members of the Board may
have given different weights to different factors. The Board realized there can be no assurance about future results, including results
expected or considered in the factors listed above. However, the Board concluded the potential positive factors outweighed the potential
negative factors of completing the merger. It should be noted that this explanation of the Board’s reasoning and all other information
presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section of this
proxy statement titled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 20.

During its consideration of the merger described above, the Board was also aware that some of its directors and executive officers may
have interests in the merger that are different from or in addition to those of its

shareholders generally, as described in the section of this proxy statement titled “Proposal No. 1—The Merger—Interests of Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 44.

The Board (i) determined that the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger and other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the plan of merger, (iii) directed that the merger
agreement be submitted to the Company’s shareholders for approval and (iv) resolved to recommend that the Company’s shareholders
approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the plan of merger. Accordingly, the
Board (other than Director Smith, who recused himself from the August 12, 2016 meeting) approved and declared advisable the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the merger and the plan of merger).

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” APPROVAL OF THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING THE MERGER AND
THE PLAN OF MERGER ATTACHED AS EXHIBIT A TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor

We retained GHF, the business of which was subsequently acquired by BMO, an affiliate of Bank of Montreal, to act as our financial
advisor in connection with the merger. In selecting GHF, we considered, among other things, the fact that GHF was a reputable investment
banking firm with substantial experience advising companies in the rail sector and in providing strategic advisory services in general, GHF
had recent experience providing strategic advisory services in connection with the sale of a short-line railroad and, in the Board’s opinion,
GHF would commit appropriate attention, resources and personnel to the process.

On August 12, 2016, BMO rendered an oral opinion to the Board, which was subsequently confirmed in a written opinion as of the
same date, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of our common stock (other than the Eder Trusts) as of that date,
and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations and qualifications upon the review undertaken by
BMO, of the merger consideration per share of our common stock to be received by those shareholders in the merger pursuant to the merger
agreement.

The full text of BMO’s written opinion, dated August 12, 2016, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and is
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should read BMO’s opinion carefully and in its entirety for a discussion of,
among other things, the scope of the review undertaken and the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by BMO in connection with its opinion. This summary is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. BMO’s opinion was directed to the Board, in its capacity as the Board, and
addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, to the holders of our common stock (other
than the Eder Trusts) of the consideration to be received by those shareholders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement.

In connection with rendering its opinion, BMO, among other things:
 

 
•  reviewed the draft dated August 12, 2016 of the merger agreement (and assumed that the final merger agreement would not

differ in any material respect from this draft of the merger agreement, and would reflect the terms of this draft of the merger
agreement);

 

 •  reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to us that BMO deemed to be relevant;
 

 
•  reviewed certain information relating to our historical, current and future operations, financial condition and prospects made

available to BMO by the Company, including financial projections

prepared by our management relating to the Company for the fiscal years ending 2016 through 2020, which we refer to as the
Projections (see the section of this proxy statement titled “Proposal No. 1—The Merger—Projected Financial Information”
beginning on page 42);

 

 
•  conducted discussions with members of senior management of the Company and certain of its representatives and advisors

concerning their view of the Company’s businesses, operations, financial condition and prospects, the merger and related
matters;

 

 •  reviewed certain financial and stock market information for selected publicly traded companies that BMO deemed to be relevant;
 

 
•  reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisitions of companies in the Company’s industry

which BMO deemed to be relevant;
 

 •  performed discounted cash flow analyses for the Company based on the Projections provided by management of the Company;
 

 
•  reviewed a certificate addressed to BMO from senior management of the Company which contains, among other things,

representations regarding the accuracy of the information, data and other materials (financial or otherwise) provided to, or
discussed with, BMO by or on behalf of the Company; and

 

 •  performed other studies and analyses, and conducted discussions as BMO deemed appropriate.

BMO assumed and relied on the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to it by the
Company or its representatives or advisors, G&W or its representatives or advisors, or obtained by it from other sources. BMO did not
independently verify (and has not assumed any obligation to verify) any information, undertake an independent valuation or appraisal of the
assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or G&W, nor was BMO furnished with any such valuation or appraisal. BMO
did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of the Company or G&W under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, or
similar matters. BMO also assumed that all material governmental, regulatory, or other approvals and consents required in connection with
the consummation of the merger will be obtained and that in connection with obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory, or other
approvals and consents, no restrictions, terms, or conditions will be imposed that would be material to its analysis. BMO also assumed that
the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, without any waiver, modification, or amendment of
any terms, condition, or agreement that would be material to its analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in
the merger agreement were as of the date of the merger agreement, and will be at the closing of the merger, true and correct in all material
respects, that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the merger agreement, and
that all conditions to the consummation of the merger will be satisfied without waiver or modification. With respect to the Projections for
the Company, BMO has been advised by the Company, and BMO has assumed, without independent investigation, that they have been
reasonably prepared and reflect the best currently available estimates and good faith judgment of the Company’s management of the
expected future competitive, operating and regulatory environments, and related financial performance of the Company. BMO expresses no
opinion with respect to the Projections, including the assumptions on which they are based. BMO relied upon and assumed, without
independent verification, that there had been no change in the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash
flows or prospects of the Company since the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or
otherwise, provided to BMO that would be material to its analyses or its opinion, and that there was no information or any facts that would
make any of the information reviewed by BMO incomplete or misleading. Furthermore, BMO has not assumed any obligation to conduct,
and has not conducted, any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of, or managed by, the Company or G&W.

BMO’s opinion is necessarily based upon financial, economic, market and other conditions and circumstances as they existed, and the
information made available to BMO, as of the date of its opinion. BMO did not undertake, and is under no obligation, to update, revise,
reaffirm or withdraw its opinion, or otherwise comment on or consider events occurring or coming to its attention after the date of its
opinion.

BMO’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to any action the Board or any other party should take in connection with the
merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any aspect thereof and is not a recommendation to any director of
the Company, any security holder or other party on how that person should act or vote with respect to the merger or related transactions and
proposals or any other matter. BMO’s opinion relates solely to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be
received by the holders of the Company common stock (which, for the avoidance of doubt, included the preferred stock on an as-converted
basis) other than the Eder Trusts in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement. BMO expressed no opinion as to the relative merits of the
merger and any other transactions or business strategies discussed by the Board as alternatives to the merger or the decision of the Board to
proceed with the merger, nor did BMO express any opinion on the structure, terms or effect of any other aspect of the merger or any other
transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, BMO did not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or
otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of the Company’s officers, directors, or
employees, or any class of those persons, in connection with the merger relative to the proposed consideration per share of common stock to
be received by holders of common stock. BMO is not an expert in, and BMO’s opinion did not address, any of the legal, tax or accounting
aspects of the merger, including, without limitation, whether or not the merger or other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
constitute a change of control under any contract or agreement to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party. BMO relied on the
Company’s legal, tax and accounting advisors for those matters. BMO’s opinion was approved by a fairness opinion committee of BMO.

The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by BMO, but
describes, in summary form, the material elements of the presentation that BMO made to the Board on August 12, 2016, in connection with
BMO’s opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by BMO in arriving at its opinion. These
summaries of financial analyses alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses BMO employed in reaching its
conclusion.

BMO’s opinion was only one of many factors considered by the Board in evaluating the proposed merger. Neither BMO’s opinion nor
its financial analyses were determinative of the merger consideration or of the views of the Board or our management with respect to the
merger consideration or the merger. None of the analyses performed by BMO were assigned a greater significance by BMO than any other,
nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by BMO. The summary text
describing each financial analysis does not constitute a complete description of BMO’s financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, and if viewed in isolation could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses
performed by BMO. The summary text set forth below does not represent and should not be viewed by anyone as constituting conclusions
reached by BMO with respect to any of the analyses performed by it in connection with its opinion. Rather, BMO made its determination as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Company’s common shareholders (other than the Eder Trusts) of the merger
consideration to be received by those shareholders in the merger pursuant to the merger agreement on the basis of its experience and
professional judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses performed.

Except as otherwise noted, the information utilized by BMO in its analyses, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on
market data as it existed on or before August 11, 2016 and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions. The analyses described
below do not purport to be indicative of actual future results, or to reflect the prices at which any securities may trade in the public markets,
which may vary depending upon various factors, including changes in interest rates, dividend rates, market conditions, economic conditions,
and other factors that influence the price of securities.

In conducting its analysis, BMO used three primary methodologies (described below under the section titled “Summary of Financial
Analysis of BMO Capital Markets Corp.”) to review the valuation of the Company on a stand-alone basis, to assess the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the Company’s common shareholders (other than the Eder Trusts) of the merger consideration to be received by
those shareholders in the merger

pursuant to the merger agreement, and BMO included the book value of $12.5 million of the Company’s South Quay property to each of the
three valuation methodologies. BMO considered the merger consideration to be received by the shareholders of the Company on a fully-
diluted basis. Specifically, BMO conducted a selected publicly traded companies analysis, a precedent transaction analysis, and a discounted
cash flow analysis. No individual methodology was given a specific weight, nor can any methodology be viewed individually. Additionally,
no company or transaction used in any analysis as a comparison is identical to the Company or the merger, and they all differ in material
ways. Accordingly, an analysis of the results described below is not mathematical; rather it involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value
of the selected companies or precedent transactions to which they are being compared. As a consequence, mathematical derivations (such as
the high, low, mean and median) of financial data are not by themselves meaningful and in selecting the ranges of multiples to be applied
were considered in conjunction with experience and the exercise of judgment. BMO used these analyses to determine the impact of various
operating metrics on the implied value per common share of the Company. Each of these analyses yielded a range of implied values, and
therefore, those implied value ranges developed from these analyses were viewed by BMO collectively and not individually.

Summary of Financial Analysis of BMO Capital Markets Corp.

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis

BMO reviewed and compared certain publicly available financial information, ratios and market multiples relating to the Company
with equivalent publicly available data for companies that share similar business characteristics with the Company to derive an implied
equity value reference range for the Company. BMO reviewed seven publicly traded North American freight railroads companies. BMO
analyzed the ratio of enterprise value (which we refer to as EV) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which we
refer to as EBITDA) for each of the last twelve months as of June 30, 2016 (which we refer to as LTM) and for estimated calendar year
2016 based on consensus Wall Street analyst research (which we refer to as Street consensus) for each of these companies for comparison
purposes. The multiples for each of the selected companies were calculated using their respective closing prices on August 11, 2016, and
were based on the most recent publicly available information and Street consensus estimates. The selected companies were as follows:
 

 •  Canadian National Railway Company
 

 •  Canadian Pacific Railway Limited
 

 •  CSX Corporation
 

 •  Genesee & Wyoming Inc.
 

 •  Kansas City Southern
 

 •  Norfolk Southern Corporation
 

 •  Union Pacific Corporation

For purposes of this analysis, BMO derived a range of multiples for each metric using the high and low multiples from the selected
publicly traded companies. For informational purposes only, and not relied upon in reaching any conclusions, BMO also reviewed the mean
and median multiples from the selected publicly traded companies.

The following table reflects the results of this analysis:

   
EV/LTM

EV/2016E

High    11.7x     11.6x  
Low    7.9x     8.0x

This analysis indicated the following implied per share equity value reference range for each share of the Company’s common stock,
as compared to the consideration to be received by the Company’s common shareholders in the merger:

No company utilized in the selected publicly traded companies analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating selected publicly
traded companies, BMO made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters which are beyond the Company’s control, such as the impact of competition on the Company and the
industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company
or the industry, or in the financial markets in general.

Analysis of Selected Precedent Transactions

BMO also performed an analysis of selected precedent transactions involving publicly traded domestic freight railroad companies that
shared certain characteristics with the merger. Based on publicly available information, BMO identified nine publicly announced and
completed transactions involving domestic companies that owned and operated freight railroad companies occurring since January 1, 2005.
BMO analyzed EV to LTM EBITDA (for the 12-month period prior to the public announcement of each respective transaction) for each of
these transactions for comparison purposes. The selected transactions and corresponding data were as follows:

Selected Precedent Transactions
 

Announcement Date   Acquiror   Target
February 2015   Genesee & Wyoming Inc.   Freightliner Group
July 2012   Genesee & Wyoming Inc.   RailAmerica, Inc.
November 2009   Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.   Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation
January 2008   Canadian National Railway Co.   EJ & E Railway, Co.
August 2008   Genesee & Wyoming Inc.   Ohio Central Railway System
September 2007   Canadian Pacific Railway, Ltd.   Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad, Corp.
November 2006   Fortress Investment Group   RailAmerica, Inc.
September 2005   RailAmerica, Inc.   Alcoa Railroad Operations
May 2005   Genesee & Wyoming Inc.   Rail Management Corporation’s rail operations

For purposes of this analysis, BMO derived a range of multiples for each metric using the high and low multiples from the selected
precedent transactions. For informational purposes only, and not relied upon in reaching any conclusions, BMO also reviewed the mean and
median multiples from the selected precedent transactions.

Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range  Merger Consideration
$10.54 - $26.50  $25.00

No company or transaction utilized as a comparison in the analysis of selected precedent transactions is identical to the Company or
directly comparable to the merger in business mix, timing and size. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing necessarily
involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that
would affect the value of the companies to which the Company is being compared. In evaluating the selected precedent transactions, BMO
made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters which are beyond the Company’s control, such as the impact of competition on the Company and the industry generally,
industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial conditions and prospects of the Company or the industry or
the financial markets in general.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

BMO performed a discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the estimated present value of the unlevered free cash flows that the
Company’s management forecasted the Company would generate for the fiscal years 2016 through fiscal year 2020 in the Projections. BMO
calculated terminal values for the Company by applying terminal EBITDA multiples ranging from 9.5x to 10.5x and estimates of the
Company’s weighted average cost of capital ranging from 11.5% to 13.5%. This analysis indicated the following implied per share equity
value reference range for each share of the Company’s common stock, as compared to the consideration to be received by the Company’s
common shareholders in the merger:
 

Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range  Merger Consideration
$10.82 - $12.34  $25.00

Miscellaneous

In connection with BMO’s services as the Company’s financial advisor and as successor to the business of GHF, the Company will pay
BMO an aggregate fee of approximately $2.52 million, a portion of which was paid upon the signing of GHF’s engagement letter with the
Company and in three monthly installments thereafter, a portion of which was paid upon delivery of BMO’s opinion, and the remainder and
majority of which is payable upon consummation of the merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse BMO for certain of its
expenses and to indemnify BMO and related persons against various potential liabilities arising out of or in connection with its engagement.

In the two years prior to the date of BMO’s opinion, BMO did not have any material relationships, nor were any material relationships
mutually understood to be contemplated, in which any compensation was received or was intended to be received by BMO as a result of any
such relationship with G&W or any G&W affiliates in

connection with the provision of any financial advisory or financing services by BMO to G&W or any of its affiliates. G&W has a Second
Amended and Restated Senior Secured Syndicated Facility Agreement dated as of March 20, 2015 under which an affiliate of BMO is a
lender with an approximately 5% participation in the syndicate and for which such affiliate has been paid revenue (fees and interest)
between $1 million and $5 million, in the aggregate, since January 1, 2014. In the two years prior to the date of BMO’s opinion, BMO did
not have any material relationships, nor were any material relationships mutually understood to be contemplated, in which any
compensation was received or was intended to be received by BMO as a result of any such relationship with the Company or its affiliates,
other than to act as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with the merger.

BMO, as part of its investment banking business, is engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, and
private placements. In the ordinary course of business, certain of BMO’s employees and affiliates, as well as investment funds in which they
may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may acquire, hold or sell, long or short positions, or trade, in debt, equity,
and other securities and financial instruments (including loans and other obligations) of, or investments in, the Company, G&W or any other
party that may be involved in the merger and their respective affiliates or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the merger.
BMO or its affiliates may provide investment and corporate banking services to the Company, G&W and their respective affiliates in the
future, for which BMO or its affiliates may receive customary fees. BMO provides a full range of financial advisory and securities services
and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may from time to time effect transactions and hold securities, including, without
limitation, derivative securities, of the Company, G&W, or their respective affiliates for its own account and for the accounts of customers.

Projected Financial Information

The Company does not as a matter of course make public financial projections as to future revenues, earnings or other results given,
among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection
with their consideration of the merger, certain forward-looking financial information prepared by the Company’s management was provided
to BMO. We have included financial projections in this proxy statement (which we refer to as the “Projections”) based on this financial
information to give our shareholders access to certain nonpublic information considered by the Transaction Committee and BMO for
purposes of considering and evaluating the merger but not to influence the decision of shareholders whether to vote for or against the
approval of the merger agreement and the merger. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the
Transaction Committee, BMO, or any other recipient of any portion of this information considered, or now considers, this information to be
material or a reliable prediction of future results.

The Projections are subjective in many respects. Although presented with numerical specificity, the Projections reflect and are based
on numerous assumptions and estimates with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, political, market and financial
conditions, competitive uncertainties, and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict and beyond the Company’s control. As a result,
there can be no assurance that these Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected.
The Projections are forward-looking statements and should be read with caution. See the section of this proxy statement titled “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 20. The Projections cover multiple years and such information by its nature
becomes less reliable with each successive year. In addition, the Projections will be affected by the Company’s ability to achieve strategic
goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business matters that are
subject to change.

The Projections were prepared to assist the Transaction Committee in evaluating the merger and not with a view toward public
disclosure or toward complying with GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for

preparation and presentation of projections. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has not examined or compiled
any of the Projections, expressed any conclusion or provided any form of assurance with respect to the Projections and, accordingly,
assumes no responsibility for them. The Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were
prepared. The Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information
regarding the Company contained in the Company’s public filings with the SEC.

Readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the specific portions of the Projections set forth below.
No one has made or makes any representation to any shareholder regarding the information included in these Projections.

The Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared, including the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Further, the Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the merger
to occur and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. Except as may be required by applicable securities laws, the
Company does not intend to update, or otherwise revise, the Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances
existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions
are shown to be in error.

For the foregoing reasons, as well as the bases and assumptions on which the Projections were compiled, the inclusion of specific
portions of the Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Projections are an accurate prediction of
future events, and they should not be relied on as such.

The following is a summary of the Projections:

(c) Unlevered Free Cash Flow represents Tax-Affected EBIT plus depreciation and amortization and minus capital expenditures and any
increase in net working capital. Capital expenditures for fiscal years 2017-2020 have been normalized at 83.6% of depreciation based
on 2.5% inflation and a 15-year depreciation period.

Delisting and Deregistration of Common Stock Following the Merger

If the merger is completed, the Company’s common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange
Act and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of the common stock.

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve the merger agreement, you should be aware that directors
and executive officers of the Company have financial interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of the
Company’s shareholders generally. The independent members of the Board were aware of and considered these potential interests, among
other matters.

As described in more detail below, these interests include certain payments and benefits that may be provided to directors and
executive officers of the Company upon completion of the merger or upon termination of their employment under certain circumstances
following the merger, including accelerated vesting of stock options and restricted stock units, cash severance in the case of a qualifying
termination of employment in connection with or following a change in control (which will include the completion of the merger), and
continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger agreement.

The dates and share prices used below to quantify these interests have been selected based upon applicable disclosure requirements
and are for illustrative purposes only. They do not necessarily reflect the dates on which certain events will occur and do not represent a
projection about the future value of common stock.

Share Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers

As of September 16, 2016, the record date for the special meeting of the Company’s shareholders, the directors and executive officers
of the Company may be deemed to be the beneficial owners of 1,107,002 shares of common stock (excluding common stock issuable upon
conversion of the preferred stock), representing 22.7% of the outstanding shares of common stock, and 500 shares of preferred stock,
representing 78.1% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock.

Indemnification

The merger agreement provides that the surviving corporation will indemnify all past and present officers and directors of the
Company and its subsidiaries for acts or omissions related to such person’s service as a director or officer of the Company or its subsidiaries
occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger to the fullest extent permitted by the RIBCA, any other applicable law, the
Company’s articles of incorporation or the Company’s bylaws, subject to any limitation imposed by law.

Under the merger agreement, G&W has agreed that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of liability existing in favor of any
director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as provided in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, similar
governing documents of a Company subsidiary or in applicable law as in effect on the date of the merger agreement with respect to matters
occurring on or prior to the effective time of the merger will survive the merger and be assumed by the surviving corporation.

For a period of six years following the effective time of the merger, the articles of incorporation and the bylaws of the surviving
corporation will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or
present directors and officers than as set forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as of the date of the merger
agreement, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for six years following the effective time of the merger in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder, except as may be required by the RIBCA.

Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

The merger agreement provides for G&W to cause the Company to maintain in effect its directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
coverage existing prior to the effective time of the merger on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable than those
of such current insurance coverage for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger for a period of six years
following the effective time of

Table of Contents

the merger. Neither G&W nor the surviving corporation will be obligated to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance on the date of the merger agreement. If the annual premiums for such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, G&W and the Company will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount. In lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, G&W has the option to purchase, prior to the effective time of the
merger, six year “tail” insurance coverage that provides coverage identical in all material respects to the coverage described above, provided
that the premium is not more than 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance on the date of the merger
agreement.

The indemnification and insurance provisions of the merger agreement described above are intended to benefit, and are enforceable
by, the indemnified persons and their respective heirs or representatives.

Change in Control Benefits Under Current Company Agreements

Change in Control Agreements with Company Executives. The Company has entered into change in control severance agreements with
its executive officers (other than Mr. Eder), including named executive officers P. Scott Conti and Frank K. Rogers. The change in control
severance agreements provide that, if the executive’s employment is terminated by the Company without “cause” or by the executive for
“good reason” (each as defined in the agreements) within two years after a change in control, the executive is entitled to a lump sum cash
payment equal to two times the executive’s annual base salary in effect at the time of the change in control (or two and one-half times if at
the time of the terminating event the executive has 30 or more years of service with the Company and its successor), payable within thirty
(30) days of the date of termination. The closing of the merger will constitute a change in control for purposes of the change in control
severance agreements.

Under the terms of the change in control severance agreements, in the event that payments and benefits under the agreements, together
with other payments and benefits the executive may receive, would constitute an “excess parachute payment” under Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 280G”), the payments to the executive will be reduced to the maximum amount that
can be deducted by the Company under Section 280G (the “280G Threshold”). Assuming the merger is completed in 2016, the Company
anticipates that severance payments to the named executive officers and other executive officers under these agreements, together with the
other amounts paid to such executives with respect to unvested equity awards, will exceed the 280G Threshold for each executive.
Accordingly, the severance payments will be reduced as noted in footnote 1 to the table entitled “Potential Change in Control
Compensation” on page 47.

In addition, each of the change in control severance agreements contains confidentiality provisions that are enforceable beyond the
termination of the executive’s employment and beyond the expiration of the change in control severance agreement.

Supplemental Employment Agreements. Immediately prior to the execution of the merger agreement, the Company entered into a
Supplemental Employment Agreement with P. Scott Conti, the Company’s President and Chief Operating Officer and a named executive
officer, and Charles D. Rennick, the Company’s Secretary and General Counsel (each a “supplemental agreement”), the terms of which
begin on the first business day following the date of termination of the executive’s employment from his current position. The supplemental
agreement with Mr. Conti provides that he will provide reasonable services as may be requested from him and that if his employment as
President and Chief Operating Officer is terminated by the Company on or before May 31, 2018 (the “contract termination date”), the
Company will employ Mr. Conti until the contract termination date or the date on which he becomes employed with another taxpayer under
the Railroad Retirement Act, whichever is earlier. As compensation for such employment, Mr. Conti will be paid $200 per calendar month.
The supplemental agreement may be terminated by the Company upon Mr. Conti’s death or for “cause” as defined in the supplemental
agreement. The supplemental agreement with Mr. Rennick is identical except that it provides that if his employment as Secretary and
General Counsel is terminated by the Company on or before May 31, 2017, the Company will employ Mr. Rennick until May 31, 2017 or
the date on which he becomes employed with another taxpayer under the Railroad Retirement Act, whichever is earlier.

Settlement of Executive Officers’ and Directors’ Equity-Based Awards

The directors and executive officers of the Company hold stock options issued under the Company 2015 Equity Plan and the 1992
Stock Option Plan and the executive officers of the Company hold restricted stock units issued under the 2015 Equity Plan. Mr. Eder does
not hold any options or restricted stock units.

Stock Options. All stock options issued to the Company’s directors and executive officers under the 1992 Stock Option Plan are fully
vested. Options granted to non-employee directors under the 2015 Equity Plan vest immediately prior to the 2017 annual shareholders
meeting and options granted to executives under the 2015 Equity Plan vest in five annual installments of 10% on January 18, 2017, 10% on
January 18, 2018, 20% on January 18, 2019, 30% on January 18, 2020 and 30% on January 18, 2021, provided that any such options vest in
full upon a change in control. As of the date of this proxy statement, the Company’s directors and executive officers (as a group) hold
options to acquire an aggregate of 53,368 shares of common stock, of which 18,368 are vested and 35,000 are unvested. Under the terms of
the merger agreement, upon closing of the merger, all stock options (whether vested or unvested) will be cancelled and the holder will
receive, for each share subject to an option, cash equal to $25.00 less the exercise price for the option, net of all applicable withholding
taxes. The amounts payable to named executive officers with respect to unvested options are included in the column titled “Equity” in the
table entitled “Potential Change in Control Compensation” on page 47 and detailed in footnote 2 to such table.

Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units granted to executives under the 2015 Equity Plan generally vest in installments over a
five year period commencing on January 18, 2017, provided certain Company performance criteria are satisfied. Under the terms of the
merger agreement, as of the effective time of the merger, each outstanding restricted stock unit, whether vested or unvested, shall be
canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $25.00 for each share of common stock covered by such restricted
stock unit, less any required withholdings. The Company’s executive officers (as a group) hold 43,500 unvested restricted stock units. The
amounts payable to executive officers with respect to the restricted stock units, assuming the completion of the merger, are included in the
column titled “Equity” in the table entitled “Potential Change in Control Compensation” on page 47 and detailed in footnote 2 to such table.

Summary of Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements

The following table and related footnotes set forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the aggregate
dollar value of the various elements of compensation that each named executive officer of the Company would receive that is based on or
otherwise relates to the merger, assuming the following:
 

 •  the merger closed on September 16, 2016, the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this proxy statement; and
 

 
•  the employment of each of Messrs. Conti and. Rogers is terminated by the Company without cause or such executive resigned

with good reason on the day immediately following the closing of the merger, thus triggering the severance payments under the
change in control severance agreements.

Any changes in these assumptions or estimates as to the closing date of the merger would affect the value of the acceleration of time-
based options and restricted stock unit awards, which would impact the calculations under Section 280G, which, in turn, would affect the
amounts shown in the following table. The actual amounts payable under the change in control severance agreements will depend on the
date of termination, the manner of the termination and the terms of the agreements in effect at such time. The calculations in the table below
do not include amounts to be paid with respect to options that are vested as of the date of the merger in accordance with their terms without
regard to the merger. Furthermore, neither Mr. Conti nor Mr. Rogers will receive the severance payments set forth under the “Cash” column
of the table unless the Company terminates such executive’s employment without “cause” or the executive terminates his employment for
“good reason” within two years following the completion of the merger.

(1) All amounts listed in this column are a “double trigger” cash severance payment, payable only if the executive’s employment with the

Company is terminated by the Company without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason” within two years following the
completion of the merger and payable in a lump sum 30 days following the date of termination. The amounts payable to the executives
are based upon two times the executive’s base salary in the amounts of $481,742 and $356,731 for Messrs. Conti and Rogers,
respectively. However, since the total severance and benefits to be received by each executive exceeds his estimated 280G Threshold,
the amount of the severance payment reflected in this column has been reduced as required by each executive’s change in control
severance agreement. See “—Change in Control Benefits Under Current Company Agreements” above. Due to the estimated 280G
Threshold for each executive, the cash severance payments to Messrs. Conti and Rogers have been reduced by $117,919 and
$142,677, respectively. These amounts assume each executive executed and did not revoke a general release of claims and complies
with the terms and conditions of such release and the restrictive covenants in such executive’s change in control agreement.

 
(2) All amounts listed in this column are payable on a single-trigger basis pursuant to the merger agreement upon a change in control and

are not conditioned upon termination of the executive’s employment, and represent the sum of the following: (a) with respect to the
outstanding stock options, the amount by which $25.00 exceeds the exercise price of the unvested stock options multiplied by the
number of shares of common stock underlying such options; and (b) with respect to the outstanding restricted stock units, the product
of $25.00 multiplied by the number of unvested restricted stock units. These amounts will be made in a lump sum following the

PROPOSAL NO. 2—ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
ARRANGEMENTS

In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Board is providing shareholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding,
advisory vote on the compensation that may be payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with, or following the
completion of, the merger. As required by those rules, the Company is asking holders of common stock and preferred stock to vote on the
adoption of the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company named executive officers in connection
with the merger, as disclosed in the table entitled “Potential Change in Control Compensation”, together with the accompanying narrative
discussion relating to the named executive officers’ compensation that may be paid or become payable and the agreements or
understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, as set forth in the section of this proxy statement
titled “Proposal No. 1—The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” are hereby APPROVED.”

The vote on this Proposal 2 is a vote separate and apart from the vote on Proposal 1 to approve the merger agreement. Accordingly,
you may vote to approve this Proposal 2 and not to approve Proposal 1, and vice versa. Because the vote to approve this Proposal 2 is
advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on the Company, G&W or the surviving corporation. Accordingly, as the compensation to be
paid in connection with the merger is contractual with the executives, regardless of the outcome of this advisory vote, such compensation
will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, if the merger agreement is approved.

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” APPROVAL OF THE NON-BINDING COMPENSATION PROPOSAL.

PROPOSAL 3: VOTE ON POSSIBLE ADJOURNMENT TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL PROXIES, IF NECESSARY

The special meeting may be adjourned to another time and place to permit further solicitation of proxies, if necessary, to obtain
additional votes to approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement. The Company currently does not intend to propose adjournment
of the special meeting if there are sufficient votes to approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

The Company is asking you to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Board to vote in favor of any adjournment of the
special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the proposal to approve the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL OF THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.

Table of Contents

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a brief summary of the significant provisions of the merger agreement by and among G&W, Merger Sub and the
Company. The summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex A and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should read the merger agreement carefully and in its
entirety.

Structure of the Merger

The merger agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company at the effective time, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with the RIBCA. The separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will
cease and the surviving corporation in the merger will be the Company, which will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of G&W. The
merger will have the effects set forth in the merger agreement, the relevant provisions of the RIBCA and other applicable law.

Closing of the Merger

The closing of the merger will occur on a date that is the fifth business day after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the closing
conditions described in the merger agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), unless another date is agreed to in writing by G&W, Merger Sub and the Company. On the
closing date of the merger, the parties will file the articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Rhode Island. The merger
will become effective upon the issuance of a certificate of merger by the Secretary of State of the State of Rhode Island subsequent to the
filing of the articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Rhode Island, or at a later time as the parties agree in writing and
specified in the articles of merger.

As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect that the merger will become effective during the fourth quarter of 2016; however,
because the merger is subject to a number of conditions, we cannot predict the actual timing of the closing of the merger or whether the
closing of the merger will occur at all.

Organizational Documents; Board of Directors and Officers of the Company Following the Merger

At the effective time of the merger, the articles of incorporation of the Company as the surviving corporation will be amended and
restated to read as set forth in the form attached to the merger agreement, and the bylaws of the Company as the surviving corporation will
be amended and restated to read as did the bylaws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time, except that the name of the
Company will remain unchanged.

Upon completion of the merger, the board of directors of the surviving corporation will consist of those individuals appointed by
G&W to serve as the directors of Merger Sub prior to the completion of the merger. Upon completion of the merger, the officers of the
Company (other than Mr. Eder, its current Chief Executive Officer) immediately prior to the effective time will continue in office until their
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

Merger Consideration

At the effective time of the merger, each share of preferred stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger (other than shares of preferred stock held by any shareholder who is entitled to demand and makes a proper demand for payment of
the fair value of such preferred stock pursuant to the RIBCA) shall be deemed to be automatically converted, along with the aggregate
accrued or accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, into 100 shares of common stock (based on the existing conversion ratio of the
preferred stock), without any further action by the relevant holder of such preferred stock or the Company. All

Table of Contents

preferred stock, when so deemed converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of such shares of preferred stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the merger
consideration payable with respect to the common stock into which such shares of preferred stock have been deemed converted. At the
effective time of the merger, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (including any
common stock into which the preferred stock is deemed to be converted, but excluding shares of common stock that are owned by G&W or
any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, including Merger Sub) will be canceled and will be converted automatically into the right to receive
$25.00 in cash without interest.

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock that is owned by the Company as treasury stock or G&W,
Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect subsidiary of G&W shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no payment or distribution will
be made with respect thereto. All shares of common stock owned by any wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company shall
remain outstanding following the effective time of the merger and no payment or distribution will be made with respect thereto.

Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards

At the effective time of the merger, subject to all required withholding taxes:
 

 

•  each option to purchase common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, whether vested
or unvested, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares of common stock underlying such unexercised stock option and (y) the excess, if any, of $25.00 over the exercise price
per share provided in such option, without interest; and

 

 
•  each restricted stock unit, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger

will be canceled and will be converted automatically into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of common stock subject to such restricted stock unit and (y) $25.00, without interest.

In addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, the Company suspended the ESPP on August 12, 2016, and paid out each ESPP
participant such participant’s accumulated contributions under the ESPP as of such date so that no additional stock purchases could be made
under the ESPP. The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the merger, the Company will terminate the ESPP and its other
equity plans.

Exchange and Payment Procedures

Prior to the effective time of the merger, G&W will appoint a bank or trust company, which we refer to as the “paying agent,” to make
payments of the merger consideration to the Company’s shareholders. Immediately following the effective time of the merger, G&W will
deposit or cause to be deposited with the paying agent cash in the aggregate amount required to pay the merger consideration to the
Company’s shareholders in accordance with the merger agreement.

As soon as practicable after the effective time of the merger, the paying agent will mail to each holder of record of a stock certificate
or stock certificates, that immediately prior to the effective time, represented outstanding shares of common stock (including certificates
representing preferred stock deemed converted into common stock) subsequently converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration, a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the stock certificates in exchange for the applicable
merger consideration.

Upon surrender to the paying agent of a stock certificate for cancellation, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal and any other required documents, (i) the holder of such stock certificate will be entitled to receive, in exchange for such stock
certificate, a check representing the applicable amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive and (ii) the surrendered stock
certificate will be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the certificates.

Table of Contents

In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of common stock or preferred stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the appropriate amount of the merger consideration may be paid to a transferee if the stock certificate representing such shares of
common stock or preferred stock is presented to the paying agent properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the paying agent to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable taxes have been paid.

Holders of uncertificated shares of common stock or preferred stock (i.e., holders whose shares are held in book-entry form, including
shares purchased under the ESPP held in book-entry form) will receive the merger consideration, without interest and subject to reduction
for any required withholding taxes, as promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger without any further action required on
the part of those holders, unless the paying agent requires that such holders first deliver an executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent
in order to receive the merger consideration that such holder is entitled to receive.

Conditions to the Merger

The obligations of G&W and the Company to effect the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver, at or prior to the closing of the
merger, of a number of conditions, including:
 

 
•  holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock, each voting separately as a class,

have approved the merger agreement and the plan of merger attached as an exhibit thereto;
 

 
•  the absence of any order, decree or injunction in effect, or any law, statute or regulation enacted or adopted by any governmental

entity, that prevents or prohibits completion of the merger;
 

 
•  there shall not have been instituted or pending any action or proceeding by any governmental entity challenging or seeking to

make illegal, to delay materially or otherwise to restrain or prohibit the completion of the merger or seeking to obtain material
damages with respect to the merger;

 

 

•  either (i) final approval or authorization of, or exemption by, the STB with respect to the merger has been obtained, and neither
the STB nor any other governmental entity shall have imposed any conditions or obligations on the merger (other than
immaterial conditions or obligations and required labor protective conditions) or (ii) if the STB has not issued a decision
approving, authorizing or exempting the merger (or denying the requested approval, authorization or exemption), then the STB
has provided G&W with a written informal opinion that the proposed voting trust submitted by G&W to the STB would insulate
G&W from unauthorized control of the Company between the effective time of the merger and receipt of final STB approval,
authorization or exemption, as the case may be; and

 

 
•  G&W and the Company have obtained any other regulatory approvals required to complete the transactions contemplated by the

merger agreement, and all related statutory waiting periods have expired.

The obligation of G&W and Merger Sub to effect the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver at or prior to the closing of the
merger of, among other things, the following additional conditions:
 

 
•  the Company’s representations and warranties regarding its and its subsidiaries’ organization and good standing, its authority to

enter into the merger agreement, absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below), and its brokers are true and
correct in all respects as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing date of the merger;

 

 
•  the representations and warranties of the Company with regards to certain elements of its capitalization and related party

transactions are true and correct in all respects (except for de minimis inaccuracy) as of the date of the merger agreement and as
of the closing date of the merger;

•  other than the representations and warranties mentioned in the two bullets directly above, all other representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in the merger agreement are true and correct (without giving effect to materiality or Company Material
Adverse Effect qualifying language) as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing date of the merger (except to the
extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except where such failure to be true and correct
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below);

 

 
•  the Company has performed or complied in all material respects with all agreements and covenants required by it under the

merger agreement at or prior to the completion of the merger; and
 

 
•  the Company has delivered to G&W a certificate, signed by an executive officer of the Company, to the effect that each of the

conditions specified in the preceding four bullets have been satisfied.

The obligation of the Company to effect the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver at or prior to the closing of the merger of,
among other things, the following additional conditions:
 

 

•  the representations and warranties of G&W are true and correct (without giving effect to materiality or G&W material adverse
effect qualifying language) as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing date of the merger (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date) except where such failure to be true and correct would
not and would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay completion of the
merger;

 

 
•  G&W having performed or complied in all material respects with all agreements and covenants required by it under the merger

agreement at or prior to the completion of the merger; and
 

 
•  G&W having delivered to the Company a certificate, signed by an executive officer of G&W, to the effect that each of the

conditions specified in the preceding two bullets have been satisfied.

The merger agreement defines a “Company Material Adverse Effect” as any effect that, individually or taken together with all other
effects, is or is reasonably expected to (i) be materially adverse to the business, results of operations, financial condition, assets or liabilities
of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) prevent or materially delay the performance by the Company of any of its
obligations under the merger agreement or the completion of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
The merger agreement provides that none of the following events occurring after the date of the merger agreement, alone or in combination,
will be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a Company Material Adverse Effect
pursuant to the foregoing clause (i):
 

 
•  any change in the Company’s stock price or trading volume (provided that such exclusion shall not apply to the effect giving rise

or contributing to such change);
 

 
•  any failure by the Company to meet revenue or earnings projections (provided that such exclusion shall not apply to the

underlying effect that may have contributed to such failure to meet any such projections);
 

 

•  any effect that results from changes affecting the railroad industry generally, or the United States economy generally, or any
effect that results from changes affecting general worldwide economic or capital market conditions, or any effect that results
from acts of war or terrorism or natural disasters, in each case except to the extent such changes, acts or disasters,
disproportionately affect the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the other freight railroad companies
operating in the United States;

 

 •  any effect caused by the announcement or pendency of the merger;
 

 
•  the performance of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including compliance with the covenants set

forth therein (except with respect to any representation or warranty regarding conflicts or required filings and consents);

foregoing disproportionately affect the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the other freight railroad
companies operating in the United States; or

 

 
•  in and of itself, the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding (provided that such exclusion shall not apply to any

underlying fact, event or circumstance that may have caused or contributed to such action, suit or proceeding).

Termination of the Merger Agreement

The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement abandoned as
follows:
 

 •  by mutual written consent of the Company and G&W;
 

 
•  by G&W or the Company, if any governmental entity issues a final, non-appealable order or takes any other action that becomes

final and non-appealable, or there exists any law, in each case, permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the
merger (so long as the party seeking termination has used reasonable best efforts to remove such order or reverse such action);

 

 •  by G&W or the Company, if the required approval of the merger agreement by the Company’s shareholders is not obtained;
 

 

•  by the Company if prior to the approval of the merger agreement and the merger by the Company’s shareholders, the Company
executes a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal substantially concurrent with such termination, subject to
compliance by the Company with the non-solicitation prohibitions in the merger agreement and payment by the Company of the
termination fee substantially concurrent with such termination;

 

 •  by G&W, if:
 

 

•  the Board withdraws, adversely modifies or publicly proposes to withdraw or adversely modify, its approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability of the merger agreement, the plan of merger or the merger (or takes any
action or makes any other public statement inconsistent with such recommendation) or approves or adopts, recommends
to the Company’s shareholders that they approve or adopt, or publicly proposes to recommend, approve or adopt a third
party takeover proposal;

 

 •  the Board fails to include in this proxy statement its recommendation to approve the merger and the merger agreement;

a takeover proposal or a superior proposal;
 

 
•  the Company breaches or fails to perform in any material respect its non-solicitation obligations set forth in the merger

agreement; or

agreement either at the special meeting or in a press release, in either case within ten business days of being requested to
do so by G&W following a publicly announced takeover proposal;

 

 

•  by G&W or the Company, if the merger is not completed by December 31, 2016 (or, if the only unsatisfied condition is STB
approval of the merger, by February 28, 2017) (such date, the “outside date”), provided that the right to terminate the merger
agreement under this circumstance will not be available to a party whose failure to fulfill any material obligation under the
merger agreement was the cause of or results in the failure of the merger to occur on or before such date; or

•  by G&W or the Company, if the other party materially breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in the merger agreement, and such breach is not cured or capable of being cured by the earlier of the date that is 30
days after delivery of written notice of such breach and the outside date; as long as the terminating party is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement.

A “takeover proposal” means any inquiry, offer or proposal from a third party (other than the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement) relating to:
 

 

•  any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or a series of transactions, of (i) 20% or more of the assets
(including capital stock of the Company’s subsidiaries) (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board in
good faith) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) 20% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock
or preferred stock;

 

 
•  any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any third party owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or

more of the outstanding shares of common stock or preferred stock; or
 

 

•  any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving the Company pursuant to which any third party (or the shareholders of any third party) would own, directly
or indirectly, 20% or more of the common stock or preferred stock (or securities of the surviving entity in a merger or the
resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity).

For purposes of the termination fee provisions described below, all references to “20% or more” in the definition of “takeover
proposal” shall instead refer to “more than 50%”.

Termination Fee

Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company must pay G&W a termination fee of $3,785,000 if:
 

 

•  G&W terminates the merger agreement as a result of (i) the Board withdrawing, adversely modifying or publicly proposing to

respect its non-solicitation obligations set forth in the merger agreement, or (vi) the Board failing to publicly reconfirm its
recommendation to the Company’s shareholders to vote in favor of the merger agreement within ten business days of being

Limitations on Considering Other Acquisition Proposals; Non-Solicitation Provisions and Exceptions

The Company has agreed that neither it nor its subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, auditors, consultants, and other agents and advisors (which we refer to as the Company’s
representatives) will, directly or indirectly:
 

 
•  solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, the making of any proposal that

constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a takeover proposal (other than contacting or engaging in discussions with the person
making a takeover proposal or its representatives for the sole purpose of clarifying such takeover proposal);

 

 
•  enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any

confidential information with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any takeover proposal; or
 

 

•  approve or recommend or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of its subsidiaries
to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement related to any takeover proposal, other than a permitted confidentiality agreement (as
described below).

The Company agreed to and will cause its subsidiaries and direct its representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated
after the execution of the merger agreement all then existing discussions and negotiations with any person with respect to any takeover
proposal and to terminate data room access of all such persons and request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished in connection therewith.

If, prior to receipt of shareholder approval of the merger agreement, the Company receives a bona fide unsolicited written takeover
proposal and the Company has not breached its obligations under the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement, the Board may
furnish information with respect to the Company

and its subsidiaries to the third party making such takeover proposal (provided that all such information has previously been provided to
G&W or is provided to G&W prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such person) and participate in
discussions and negotiations regarding such bona fide unsolicited written takeover proposal if:
 

 

•  the Board first determines (1) after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such takeover proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a superior proposal, and (2) after consultation
with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the Board’s fiduciary duties to our shareholders under applicable law; and

 

 

•  prior to furnishing or affording access to any information or data with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
otherwise relating to a takeover proposal, the third party enters into a customary confidentiality agreement with the Company
containing terms substantially similar to those contained in the Company’s confidentiality agreement with G&W (a “permitted
confidentiality agreement”).

A “superior proposal” means any bona fide unsolicited takeover proposal that if consummated would result in a third party owning,
directly or indirectly, (a) 50% or more of common stock and preferred stock (or securities of the surviving entity in a merger or the resulting
direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity) or (b) 50% or more of the assets (based on the fair market value thereof,
as determined by the Board in good faith) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which, in either case, the Board determines
(after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its financial advisor and outside counsel), would be more favorable to the
shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the merger, taking into account all legal, financial (including the financing
terms thereof), regulatory and other aspects of such offer and the likelihood and timing of consummation.

The Company has agreed to, as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within two business days, notify G&W orally and in
writing of the receipt of any takeover proposal or any request for information or other inquiry (including copies of any written proposal or
inquiry related thereto) that the Company reasonably believes could lead to any takeover proposal, the material terms and conditions of any
such takeover proposal or request for information or other inquiry and the identity of the person making any such takeover proposal or
request for information or other inquiry. The Company is also required, subject to the Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law, to keep
G&W reasonably informed of any material developments with respect to any such takeover proposal or request for information or other
inquiry (including any material changes thereto).

In addition, under the merger agreement, the Company agreed that neither its Board nor any committee of the Board, will:
 

 

•  withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to G&W), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to G&W),
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board or any such committee of the merger agreement, the
plan of merger and the merger (or take any other action or make any other public statement inconsistent with such
recommendation);

 

 
•  recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly propose to recommend, approve or adopt, any takeover

proposal (together with the action in the immediately preceding bullet, an “adverse recommendation change”);
 

 

•  approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of its subsidiaries
to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any takeover proposal, other than any permitted confidentiality
agreement; or

 

 •  authorize any of, or resolve, commit or agree to take any of, the foregoing actions.

However, prior to receipt of shareholder approval of the merger agreement, the Board may either make an adverse recommendation
change or cause or permit the Company to terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement regarding a superior
proposal, if, after consultation with, and taking into the account the

advice of, its outside counsel, it determines that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law and, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, it determines in good faith that the takeover proposal
constitutes a superior proposal (and such determination is reaffirmed in good faith by the Board after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside counsel at the end of the notice period described below), subject to the Company’s compliance with the notice provisions
described below.

In the event the Board makes this determination and prior to making an adverse recommendation change or terminating the merger
agreement, the Company must provide three business days’ prior written notice to G&W that the Board intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor, including the material terms and conditions of any superior proposal (and the identity of the person making
such superior proposal) that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board. During such three business day period, if requested by G&W,
the Company and its representatives must engage in good faith negotiations with G&W and its representatives to, among other things,
amend the merger agreement in such a manner that (i) any takeover proposal which was determined to constitute a superior proposal no
longer is a superior proposal and (ii) the failure of the Board to make an adverse recommendation change would no longer be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Any changes to the financial or other terms of the merger agreement or the other transaction
documents made by the Company in response to a notice of superior proposal must be taken into account by the Board in determining
whether to make an adverse recommendation change or to terminate the merger agreement in connection with a superior proposal. Any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such superior proposal will require a new three business day notice
period and the Company must follow the requirements set forth above with respect to such amendment.

Prior to receipt of shareholder approval of the merger agreement, in the event that a positive event, fact, circumstance, development or
occurrence with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries or the business of the Company and its subsidiaries occurs that is material to
the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which was unknown and not reasonably foreseeable to the Board when the merger
agreement was executed, or if known, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board when the merger
agreement was executed, and that becomes known prior to obtaining shareholder approval of the merger agreement (an “intervening
event”), and the Board determines, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take an action in response to such
intervening event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, the Board may make an adverse recommendation change, provided that
the Company has provided three business days’ written notice to G&W of such intervening event, which notice will include a description of
the applicable intervening event and the action intended to be taken by the Board and the reasons therefor, and during such period the
Company has negotiated in good faith with G&W, if requested by G&W, to amend the merger agreement in such a manner as (i) to obviate
the need for adverse recommendation change and (ii) the failure to make such adverse recommendation change would no longer be
inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law. Any changes to the financial or other terms of the merger agreement or
the other transaction documents made by the Company in response to a notice of intervening event must be taken into account by the Board
in determining whether to make an adverse recommendation change in connection with an intervening event. Any material change in
respect of such intervening event will require a new three business day notice period and the Company must follow the requirements set
forth above with respect to such material change.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the merger agreement shall prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state law, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making any “stop-look-and-listen” communication to the Company’s shareholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or any similar disclosure to the Company’s shareholders if the Company determines after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its obligations under law, in each case as long as
the Board publicly reaffirms its recommendation of approval of the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger in such disclosure
or communication (other than in a customary “stop-look-and-listen” communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)).

The Shareholders Meeting

The Company has agreed to take all actions in accordance with applicable law, the Company’s articles of incorporation, the
Company’s bylaws and the rules of the NASDAQ to duly call, hold and convene a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable
after the SEC clears this proxy statement (but in any event, on or around the 20th business day following the mailing of this proxy
statement) to consider and vote upon the approval of the merger agreement and any other matter required to be approved by the
shareholders of the Company in order to complete the merger.

In addition, the Company has agreed to recommend approval of the merger agreement, the plan of merger, and the merger by the
Company’s shareholders, and to include such recommendation in this proxy statement. Neither the Board nor any committee thereof shall
withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to resolve to withdraw or modify such recommendation in a manner adverse to G&W other than as
described above in the section titled “—Limitations on Considering Other Acquisition Proposals; Non-Solicitation Provisions and
Exceptions.” Unless the merger agreement has been terminated and subject to the Board’s right to make an adverse recommendation change
as described above in the section titled “—Limitations on Considering Other Acquisition Proposals; Non-Solicitation Provisions and
Exceptions,” the Company has agreed to take all lawful action to solicit from its shareholders proxies, and shall take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure a vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock,
in favor of the approval of the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger. The Company may adjourn or postpone the special
meeting to a date that is 30 calendar days or less after the date on which the special meeting was (or was required to be) originally scheduled
(unless G&W consents to a later date) (i) after consultation with G&W, to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally required
supplement or amendment to this proxy statement is provided to the Company’s shareholders or (ii) with G&W’s consent in the absence of a
quorum.

Indemnification and Insurance

Indemnification

The merger agreement provides that the surviving corporation will indemnify all past and present officers and directors of the
Company and its subsidiaries for acts or omissions related to such person’s service as a director or officer of the Company or its subsidiaries
occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger to the fullest extent permitted by the RIBCA, any other applicable law, the
Company’s articles of incorporation or the Company’s bylaws, subject to any limitation imposed by law.

Under the merger agreement, G&W has agreed that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of liability existing in favor of any
director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as provided in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, similar
governing documents of a Company subsidiary or in applicable law as in effect on the date of the merger agreement with respect to matters
occurring on or prior to the effective time of the merger will survive the merger and be assumed by the surviving corporation.

For a period of six years following the effective time of the merger, the articles of incorporation and the bylaws of the surviving
corporation will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or
present directors and officers than as set forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as of the date of the merger
agreement, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for six years following the effective time of the merger in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder, except as may be required by the RIBCA.

Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

The merger agreement provides for G&W to cause the Company to maintain in effect its directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
coverage existing prior to the effective time of the merger on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable than those
of such current insurance coverage for acts or omissions

occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger for a period of six years following the effective time of the merger. Neither G&W
nor the surviving corporation will be obligated to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance on the date of the merger agreement. If the annual premiums for such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
G&W and the Company will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. In
lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, G&W has the option to purchase, prior to the effective time of the merger, six year “tail” insurance
coverage that provides coverage identical in all material respects to the coverage described above, provided that the premium is not more
than 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance on the date of the merger agreement.

The indemnification and insurance provisions of the merger agreement described above are intended to benefit, and are enforceable
by, the indemnified persons and their respective heirs or representatives.

Conduct of Business Pending the Merger

Under the merger agreement, the Company has agreed that, until the effective time of the merger or the termination of the merger
agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries, except as expressly permitted by the merger agreement or with the prior written consent of
G&W, (i) will maintain its existence in good standing under applicable law, (ii) conduct its business and operations in the ordinary course of
business consistent with prior practice, (iii) use reasonable best efforts to preserve substantially intact its business organizations, to keep
available the services of its current officers and employees and to preserve the current relationships of the Company and its subsidiaries
with customers, suppliers, distributors and other persons with which the Company or any of its subsidiaries has material business relations

dividends on common stock not to exceed $0.04 per share and the regular annual dividend on preferred stock not to exceed $5.00

acquisition of common stock in connection with the forfeiture of awards granted under the Company’s equity plans);

 

 

•  issue, deliver or sell any shares of its capital stock or interests in any of its subsidiaries or any options, warrants, or other similar
rights, other than the issuance of shares of common stock (A) in accordance with the Company Anniversary Stock Plan in

restricted stock units outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement, or (C) upon conversion of the outstanding shares of
preferred stock in accordance with its terms;

Company’s subsidiaries;

The agreements relating to the conduct of the Company’s business contained in the merger agreement are complicated and not easily

Employee Benefits

Under the terms of the merger agreement, from and after the effective time of the merger through December 31, 2017, G&W will
cause the surviving corporation to provide to Company employees who are employed as of the effective time of the merger, (i) base salary
and annual incentive bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than the base salary and target bonus opportunities applicable to such
Company employees immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and (ii) employee benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to
the employee benefits provided to such employees immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. However, for union employees, the
wages, hours and other terms will be as provided for in any applicable collective bargaining agreement or pursuant to applicable law.

Until December 31, 2017, G&W will provide each Company employee who incurs an involuntary termination of employment without
cause with severance payments and severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance payments and severance benefits to
which such Company employees would have been entitled with respect to such termination under the severance policies or agreements of
the Company as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, the Company suspended the ESPP on August 12, 2016 and each ESPP participant’s accumulated
contributions in the participant’s ESPP account were paid to such participant on August 24, 2016. No additional payroll deductions are
permitted under the merger agreement. Prior to and contingent upon the closing of the merger, the Company will take all actions that are
necessary to provide that the ESPP will terminate as of the effective date of the merger.

Following the merger, G&W will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to (1) honor all obligations under the Company
equity plans and compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to
the merger, and the merger will be deemed to constitute a “change in control,” “change of control” or “corporate transaction” under such
equity plans, arrangements or agreements, (2) give Company employees employed prior to the merger full credit for such Company
employees’ service with the Company and its subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting, but not for purposes of benefit accruals
(except vacation and severance), and (3) use reasonable best efforts to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable
to such Company employees’ and their eligible

dependents under any G&W benefit plan (other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such Company employees as of the
effective time of the merger under analogous benefit plans), (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by
the Company employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior to the merger in
satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans in which such Company employees participate
following the merger in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred, and (iii)
waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company employee and
his or her eligible dependents following the merger, to the extent such Company employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under an analogous the Company benefit plan prior to the merger.

The Company is permitted to pay bonuses based on services rendered through the effective time of the merger to Company employees
and executive officers and in such amount(s) as the Board may determine, so long as the aggregate amount of such bonuses does not exceed
$350,000.

Efforts to Complete the Merger

The Company, Merger Sub and G&W agreed to use reasonable best efforts to:
 

 

•  obtain all necessary, proper or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, qualifications and approvals from
governmental entities and make all necessary, proper or advisable registrations, filings and notices and take all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval, waiver or exemption from any governmental entity (including under, if applicable, the HSR Act
and from the STB);

 

 
•  obtain all necessary, proper or advisable consents, qualifications, approvals, waivers or exemptions from non-governmental third

parties; and
 

 
•  execute and deliver any additional documents or instruments necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions

contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, the merger agreement and transaction documents.

With respect to STB regulatory filings, G&W, Merger Sub and the Company agreed to cooperate with one another (i) in promptly
making any filings with the STB for the approval or exemption of the merger and the transactions contemplated thereby, and seeking a
written informal opinion regarding G&W’s proposed form of and possible use of a voting trust agreement, furnishing information required
in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any such approval or exemption and (ii) in keeping the other party reasonably
informed of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for, additional information from the STB regarding any of
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Additionally, under the merger agreement, the Company, Merger Sub and G&W agreed to use reasonable best efforts to avoid or
eliminate impediments under any antitrust law that may be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the merger so as to enable
the closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of G&W or its subsidiaries or affiliates or of
the Company or its subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the closing date would limit the freedom of
G&W or its subsidiaries’ freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its subsidiaries’ businesses, product
lines or assets, in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
closing.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

Before G&W may complete the merger and within fifteen business days of the date of the merger agreement, G&W must file with the
STB the appropriate documentation for the approval of, authorization of or

exemption by, the STB of the merger. On September 1, 2016, G&W filed a petition for exemption with the STB requesting approval or
exemption to complete the merger and control the Company. On September 14, 2016, G&W also submitted a form of voting trust agreement
to the STB seeking a written informal opinion that using a voting trust arrangement would insulate G&W from having unauthorized control
of the Company if (i) G&W has not received from the STB the approval or exemption of the merger before the effective time of the merger
and (ii) the stock of the surviving corporation is placed into the voting trust immediately following the merger.    

Transaction Litigation

The Company will promptly notify G&W (and in any event within two business days), and keep G&W reasonably informed of :
 

 
•  any communication from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the merger

agreement,
 

 •  any communication from any governmental entity in connection with the merger agreement, and
 

 

•  any actions, suits, claims, litigations, investigations or proceedings, including any shareholder litigation, commenced, threatened
or, to its knowledge, contemplated against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or any of its or their officers or the Board, that, if pending on the date of the merger agreement, would have been required to have
been disclosed pursuant to the merger agreement, or that relate to the merger agreement, the merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

The Company shall reasonably consult with G&W with respect to (and allow G&W to participate in), and shall consider in good faith
G&W’s advice with respect to, the defense or settlement of any such action, suit, claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding, and no
settlement, agreement to settle or action taken to settle thereof shall be agreed to without G&W’s prior written consent.

Representations and Warranties

The merger agreement contains representations and warranties that the Company, on the one hand, and G&W and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, made solely to each other as of specific dates relating to their respective businesses. Those representations and warranties were
made only for purposes of the merger agreement and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties,
including the disclosure letter referenced in the merger agreement that the Company delivered to G&W in connection with the execution of
the merger agreement. Moreover, some of those representations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement, which
subsequent information may or may not be reflected in the Company’s public disclosures, may be subject to a standard of materiality
provided for in the merger agreement, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk among G&W and the Company rather than
establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, they should not be relied upon as statements of factual information. Third parties are not entitled
to the benefits of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement.

The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of the Company relating to:
 

 •  organization and good standing, charter documents;
 

 •  authority for merger agreement;
 

 •  capitalization;
 

 •  the Company subsidiaries;
 

 •  no conflict with certain organizational documents, agreements and governmental orders;
 

 •  required filings and consents;

Table of Contents

Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by knowledge or materiality qualifications or by the
“G&W material adverse effect” clause. A “G&W material adverse effect” is any effect with respect to G&W or Merger Sub that,
individually or taken together with all other effects that have occurred prior to the date of determination of the occurrence of the G&W
material adverse effect, is or would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

None of the representations and warranties by either party survives the effective time of the merger. The representations and
warranties in the merger agreement are complicated and not easily summarized. You are urged to carefully read Articles III and IV of the
merger agreement attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.

Expenses

Each party will pay all fees and expenses it incurs in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
whether or not the merger is consummated.

Amendments

G&W, Merger Sub and the Company may amend the merger agreement by executing a written amendment approved by their
respective boards of directors. However, after approval of the merger agreement by the Company’s shareholders, no amendment of the
merger agreement may be made which by law requires further approval of the Company’s shareholders without obtaining that approval.

Specific Performance

The parties to the merger agreement are entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the merger agreement in any court in the State of Rhode Island or any federal court sitting
in the State of Rhode Island. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties further acknowledge and agree that prior to the termination of the
merger agreement, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to cause G&W to effect the closing, on the terms and subject
to the conditions of the merger agreement, if (but only if) (A) all conditions (other than those conditions that (i) only qualify G&W’s or
Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the merger and (ii) by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing so long as such conditions
would be satisfied if the closing date were the date on which the Company is seeking specific performance) have been satisfied and
(B) G&W and Merger Sub fail to complete the closing by the date the closing is required to have occurred.

DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS

Under Section 7-1.2.1201 of the RIBCA, holders of shares of a class of stock registered on a national securities exchange are not
entitled to dissenters’ rights. Consequently, holders of the common stock are not entitled to dissenters’ rights with respect to such shares. If
the merger is consummated, holders of shares of preferred stock are entitled to dissenters’ rights under Section 7-1.2-1201 of the RIBCA,
provided that they comply with the conditions established by Sections 7-1.2-1201 and 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA.

Sections 7-1.2-1201 and 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA are reprinted in their entirety as Annex D to this proxy statement and are
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law relating to dissenters’
rights and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Annex D. This discussion and Annex D should be reviewed carefully by any holder of
preferred stock who wishes to exercise statutory dissenters’ rights or who wishes to preserve the right to do so, as failure to comply with the
required procedures may result in the loss of rights.

A record holder of preferred stock who makes the objection described below with respect to such shares of preferred stock and who
otherwise complies with the statutory requirements of Sections 7-1.2-1201 and 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA will be entitled to the fair value of
his or her shares of preferred stock. Except as set forth herein, shareholders will not be entitled to dissenters’ rights in connection with the
merger.

Holders of shares of preferred stock who desire to exercise their dissenters’ rights must not vote in favor of the merger agreement and
must deliver a separate written objection to the merger to us prior to or at the special meeting at which the merger agreement will be
submitted to a vote by the shareholders. If the merger agreement is approved at the special meeting and you did not vote in favor of it,
within 10 days after the date on which the vote was taken, you must deliver to us a written demand for payment of the fair value of your
shares of preferred stock. A proxy or vote against the merger agreement will not by itself constitute such a demand. A shareholder who
elects to exercise dissenters’ rights should mail or deliver his or her written objection and demand to: Secretary and General Counsel of the
Company, Charles D. Rennick, Providence and Worcester Railroad Company, 75 Hammond Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01610. We
will not give you notice of the results of the special meeting and you must, therefore, comply with the 10-day demand notice time frame by
taking affirmative action to determine the outcome of the vote. Any shareholder who fails to make a demand within the 10-day period will
be bound by the terms of the merger agreement and the merger. Any shareholder making any such demand is thereafter only entitled to
payment as provided in the RIBCA and is not entitled to vote or to exercise any other rights of a shareholder.

No demand may be withdrawn without the Company’s consent. If (i) the demand is withdrawn upon consent, (ii) the proposed
corporate action is abandoned or rescinded or the shareholders revoke the authority to effect the action, (iii) on the date of the filing of the
articles of merger the surviving corporation is the owner of all of the outstanding shares of the other corporations that are party to the
merger, (iv) no demand or petition for the determination of fair value by a court has been made or filed within the time frame described
below or (v) a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the shareholder is not entitled to the relief described in this section, then the
right of the shareholder to be paid the fair value of his, her or its shares ceases and his, her or its status as a shareholder is restored, without
prejudice to any corporate proceedings taken during the interim.

Within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation must provide notice of the effective time to all holders
of preferred stock who have complied with Section 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA and demanded payment, together with a written offer to each
dissenting shareholder to pay for his/her/its shares of preferred stock at a specified price deemed by the surviving corporation to be fair as of
the day prior to the day the vote approving the merger agreement was taken (excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of
the merger). The notice and offer must be accompanied by a balance sheet of the Company as of the latest available date and not more than
twelve months prior to the making of the offer and a profit and loss statement of the Company for the twelve month period ended on the
date of the balance sheet.

Table of Contents

If within 30 days after the effective time of the merger, the dissenting shareholder and the surviving corporation agree on the fair value
of the shares of preferred stock, payment by the surviving corporation will be made within 90 days of the effective time of the merger, upon
surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares. If within 30 days after the effective time of the merger the parties do not
agree on the fair value, the dissenting shareholder may file a written request to the surviving corporation within 60 days of the effective time
of the merger, requesting that the surviving corporation file a petition in a court in Providence County in the State of Rhode Island
demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of preferred stock of all dissenting shareholders. The surviving corporation, within
30 days of receiving such request shall, or at its election at any time within the 60 days following the effective time of the merger may, file
such petition. If the surviving corporation fails to institute this proceeding, any dissenting shareholder may do so in the name of the
surviving corporation. Holders of preferred stock seeking to exercise dissenters’ rights should not assume that we will file such a petition.
Accordingly, holders of preferred stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate requests as necessary for the perfection of
their dissenters’ rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA.

A copy of the petition must be served on each dissenting shareholder who is a resident of Rhode Island and served by registered or
certified mail on each dissenting shareholder who is a nonresident of Rhode Island. Service on nonresidents of Rhode Island may also be
made by publication as provided by law. All shareholders who are parties to the proceeding are entitled to judgment against the surviving
corporation for the amount of the fair value of their shares of preferred stock. The court may, if it so elects, appoint one or more persons as
appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers have the power and authority that is
specified in the order of their appointment or an amendment of the order. The judgment is payable only upon and concurrently with the
surrender to the surviving corporation of the certificate or certificates representing the preferred stock. Upon payment of the judgment, the
dissenting shareholders cease to have any interest in the shares.

The court shall determine and assess the costs and expenses of any proceeding against the surviving corporation, but all or any part of
the costs and expenses may be apportioned and assessed as the court deems equitable against any or all of the dissenting shareholders who
are parties to the proceeding to whom the surviving corporation has made an offer to pay for the preferred stock if the court finds that the
action of the shareholders in failing to accept the offer was arbitrary or vexatious or not in good faith. The expenses include reasonable
compensation for and reasonable expenses of the appraisers, but exclude the fees and expenses of counsel for and experts employed by any
party; but if the fair value of the preferred stock as determined materially exceeds the amount which the surviving corporation offered to pay
for the preferred stock, or if no offer was made, the court in its discretion may award to any shareholder who is a party to the proceeding a
sum that the court determines to be reasonable compensation to any expert or experts employed by the shareholder in the proceeding.

Within 20 days of demanding payment under Section 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA, each shareholder who demanded payment for their
shares of preferred stock and who holds preferred stock represented by certificates must submit their certificates of preferred stock to the
Company for notation thereon of the pendency of the demand proceedings. Failure to submit certificates representing shares of preferred
stock, at the option of the surviving corporation, terminates such holder’s rights under Section 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA unless a court of
competent jurisdiction, for good and sufficient cause shown, directs otherwise. If shares of preferred stock represented by a certificate on
which notation has been made are transferred, each new certificate issued for the shares of preferred stock must bear similar notation,
together with the name of the original dissenting holder of the shares of preferred stock, and a transferee of the shares of preferred stock
acquires by the transfer no rights in the surviving corporation other than those which the original dissenting shareholder had after making
demand for payment of the fair value of the shares.

Although we believe that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the determination of fair
value and holders of preferred stock should recognize that such a determination could result

in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration. Moreover, we do not anticipate offering more
than the merger consideration to any shareholder exercising dissenters’ rights, and reserve the right to assert, in any dissenters’ proceeding,
that, for purposes of Section 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA, the fair value of shares of preferred stock is less than the merger consideration.

HOLDERS OF SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK CONSIDERING EXERCISING DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS SHOULD
RECOGNIZE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THEIR SHARES DETERMINED UNDER SECTION 7-1.2-1202 OF THE RIBCA COULD
BE MORE THAN, THE SAME AS, OR LESS THAN THE CONSIDERATION THEY ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE UNDER THE
MERGER AGREEMENT IF THEY DO NOT EXERCISE THEIR DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS.

Any holder of shares of preferred stock who has duly demanded fair value in compliance with Section 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA will
not, after the effective time of the merger, be entitled to vote for any purpose any shares subject to such demand or to receive payment of
dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for dividends or distribution payable to shareholders of record at a date prior to the
effective time of the merger.

Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 7-1.2-1202 of the RIBCA will result in the loss of a
shareholder’s statutory dissenters’ rights.

THE VOTING AGREEMENT

The following summary of the voting agreement is qualified by reference to the complete text of the voting agreement, which is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference.

In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, G&W and the Company entered into a voting agreement with the Robert H.
Eder Trust and the Linda Eder Trust (which we refer to as the “Eder Trusts”), which, as of the date of the voting agreement, collectively
owned 842,742 shares of common stock and 500 shares of preferred stock. Under the voting agreement, each Eder Trust must vote all of its
shares of Company stock:
 

 
•  in favor of approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger

and any other action reasonably requested by G&W in furtherance thereof;
 

 
•  against any other merger agreement, merger, consolidation, combination, sale of substantial assets, reorganization,

recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of or by the Company;
 

 •  against any takeover proposal; and

frustrate, prevent, adversely affect, interfere with or nullify any provision of the merger agreement, the plan of merger attached
thereto or any other transaction documents (including the voting agreement), the merger or any related transaction or change in
any manner the voting rights of any capital stock of the Company.

Under the voting agreement, each of the Eder Trusts agreed not to, and not to permit any of its representatives, to:
 

 

•  solicit, initiate, encourage or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries with respect to a potential takeover proposal or
action which would impede, frustrate, prevent, adversely affect, interfere with or nullify any provision of the merger agreement,
the plan of merger attached thereto, any other transaction document (including the voting agreement), the merger or any related
transaction or change in any manner the voting rights of any capital stock of the Company;

would impede, frustrate, prevent adversely affect, interfere with or nullify any provision of the merger agreement, the plan of
merger attached thereto, any other transaction document (including the voting agreement), the merger or any related transaction
or change in any manner the voting rights of any capital stock of the Company;

affect, interfere with or nullify any provision of the merger agreement, the plan of merger attached thereto, any other transaction
document (including the voting agreement), the merger or any related transaction or change in any manner the voting rights of
any capital stock of the Company, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to any takeover proposal or an action which would impede, frustrate, prevent, adversely

document (including the voting agreement), the merger or any related transaction or change in any manner the voting rights of
any capital stock of the Company;

 

 •  approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, a takeover proposal; or
 

 •  authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.

In addition, except under limited circumstances, the Eder Trusts also agreed not to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of or
encumber their shares of Company stock while the voting agreement is in effect. The Eder Trusts also agreed to waive and not exercise or
assent to any dissenters’ rights under the RIBCA in connection with the merger or to commence or participate in any claim against the
Company, G&W or any of their respective successors relating to the negotiation, execution and delivery of the voting agreement or the
merger agreement or the consummation of the merger or any related transactions (other than claims to the extent relating to or based upon
any alleged breach by G&W of the voting agreement). The voting agreement terminates immediately upon the earlier of the effective time
of the merger, the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, or mutual written agreement of G&W and the Eder
Trusts.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

The following is a general summary of material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. Holders (as
defined below). The United States federal income tax laws are complex and the tax consequences of the merger may vary depending upon
each shareholder’s individual circumstances or tax status. The following discussion is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), existing temporary and final regulations under the Code and current administrative rulings and
court decisions, all of which are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. No attempt has been made to comment on all United
States federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be relevant to the Company’s shareholders. The tax discussion set forth
below is included for general information only. It is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice to a particular
shareholder.

The following discussion may not apply to particular categories of holders of shares of common stock or preferred stock subject to
special treatment under the Code, such as insurance companies, financial institutions, broker-dealers, tax-exempt organizations, individual
retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, banks, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons who hold the Company’s capital
stock as part of a straddle, hedging or conversion transaction, persons whose functional currency is other than the United States dollar,
persons eligible for tax treaty benefits, foreign corporations, foreign partnerships and other foreign entities, individuals who are not citizens
or residents of the United States, dissenting shareholders and holders whose shares were acquired pursuant to the exercise of an employee
stock option or otherwise as compensation. This discussion assumes that holders of shares of common stock and/or preferred stock hold
their shares as capital assets (generally, property held for investment). The following discussion does not address state, local or foreign tax
consequences of the merger.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is any beneficial owner of shares of common stock or preferred stock that for United
States federal income tax purposes is or is treated as:
 

 •  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 

 
•  a corporation (or other entity classified as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized

under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 •  an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source; or
 

 
•  a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning

of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) has a valid election in
effect to be treated as a “United States person” for United States federal income tax purposes.

The United States federal income tax consequences of the merger to a partner in an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for
United States federal income tax purposes that holds common stock or preferred stock generally will depend on the status of the partner and
the activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership holding common stock or preferred stock should consult their own tax advisors.

The Merger

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock or preferred stock of the Company in the merger will be
a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax consequences. In general, you will recognize gain or loss for United States federal
income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and your adjusted tax basis in your shares of
common stock or preferred stock, as applicable. Your adjusted tax basis in a share will generally be equal to the amount you paid for the
share. Gain or loss and holding period will be determined separately for each block of shares of common stock or preferred stock (that is,
shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) exchange for cash in the merger. Generally, any gain or loss recognized upon the
exchange will be capital gain or loss, and any such

Table of Contents

capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if you have established a holding period of more than one year for your shares of
Company stock. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, are generally taxable at a
reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

In addition, a 3.8% tax is imposed on all or a portion of the “net investment income” (within the meaning of the Code) of certain
individuals (or the “undistributed net investment income” of certain estates and trusts). The 3.8% tax generally is imposed on the lesser of
(i) the U.S. Holder’s “net investment income” (or the “undistributed net investment income” of certain estates and trusts) for the relevant
taxable year and (ii) the excess of the U.S. Holder’s modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold (which in
the case of individuals is between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the individual’s circumstances). For these purposes, “net
investment income” generally will include any gain recognized on the receipt of cash for shares pursuant to the merger.

Backup Withholding

U.S. Holders of the Company’s stock may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding on any cash payments they
receive. The Company’s shareholders will not be subject to backup withholding, however, if they:
 

 
•  furnish a correct taxpayer identification number and certify that they are not subject to backup withholding on the Form W-9 or

successor form included in the election form/letter of transmittal they will receive; or
 

 •  are otherwise exempt from backup withholding.

Certain U.S. Holders (including corporations) are not subject to background withholding or information reporting rules.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund or credit against a
shareholder’s United States federal income tax liability may be obtained from the IRS, provided the shareholder timely furnishes the
required information to the IRS. A holder that does not furnish their correct TIN may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS.

Other Tax Consequences

The state and local tax treatment of the merger may not conform to the United States federal income tax consequences discussed
above. Consequently, you should consult your own tax advisors regarding the treatment of the merger under state and local tax laws.

The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above are not intended to constitute a complete description of all tax
consequences relating to the merger. Because individual circumstances may differ, each shareholder should consult the
shareholder’s tax advisor regarding the applicability of the rules discussed above to the shareholder and the particular tax effects to
the shareholder of the merger in light of such shareholder’s particular circumstances, the application of state, local and foreign tax
laws, and, if applicable, the treatment of stock options, restricted stock units or any other matters relating to equity compensation
or benefit plans.

Consideration payable with respect to the Company Common Stock into which such Preferred Shares have been deemed
converted (the “Converted Shares”), as provided in Section 1.4(b) hereof. From and after the Effective Time, (i) each Preferred

be canceled and, as of the Effective Time, the Company shall pay to the holder thereof cash in an amount equal to the product of
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock provided for in such Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock provided for in such Option, which cash payment
shall be made without interest and shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes.

 

 

(b) Each restricted share unit granted under any Company Equity Plan, agreement or arrangement of the Company, or otherwise
(each, a “Restricted Share Unit”), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock covered by such Restricted Share Units, less any required withholdings. As of the Effective Time, each holder of
Restricted Share Units shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

 

(c) At the Effective Time, the Company Equity Plans shall terminate and the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company shall be of no further force
and effect and shall be deemed to be deleted. The Company shall take all actions necessary in order to effect the provisions of
this Section 1.7, including adopting all necessary resolutions, reimbursing employees for applicable payroll withholdings
authorized under the ESPP, seeking all necessary approvals and providing any notices required under the Company Equity Plans.

Section 1.8 Dissenter Shares.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenter Shares shall not be deemed converted into Company
Common Stock and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.4(a), but instead holders of
Dissenter Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Part 12. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose such holder’s dissenters’ rights under Part
12 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Part 12, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s Dissenter Shares under Part 12 shall cease and such Dissenter Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable with respect
to the Converted Shares represented thereby as provided in Section 1.4(a), without interest. At the Effective Time, the Dissenter Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenter Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except such rights provided in the preceding two sentences. The Company shall serve prompt notice to
Parent of any demands for dissenters’ rights under Part 12 of any holder of the Preferred Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the RIBCA received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, or
as otherwise required under the RIBCA, waive any failure by a holder of Dissenter Shares to timely deliver a written demand or to perform
any other act perfecting dissenter’s rights in accordance with the RIBCA, make any payment (or offer to make any payment) with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Section 1.9 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution.

Subject to the restrictions contained in Section 5.1, in the event that the Company changes the number of Shares issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration
shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect such change.

Article II. EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 Paying Agent.

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent to act as paying agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration
upon surrender of the Certificates pursuant to this Article II, in the case of certificated Shares, and automatically, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in the
aggregate amount required to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares pursuant to Section 1.4 (such cash amount being
referred to herein as the “Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Fund shall be used solely for purposes of paying the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Article II and shall not be used to satisfy any other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Pending
distribution of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Article II, Parent may direct the Paying Agent to invest such cash, provided that
such investments (i) shall be obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, commercial paper obligations receiving the
highest rating from either Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, or certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of domestic commercial banks with capital exceeding $500,000,000 (collectively “Permitted
Investments”) or money market funds that are invested solely in Permitted Investments and (ii) shall have maturities that will not prevent or
delay payments to be made pursuant to this Article II. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable solely to Parent
(or its designee).

Section 2.2 Exchange Procedures.
 

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Shares subsequently converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in Section 1.4: (i) a letter of transmittal (a “Letter of Transmittal”) that (A) shall
specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof, together with any bond or indemnity agreement, as
contemplated by Section 2.6) and (B) shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify;
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration.

 

 

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and any other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent
or the Surviving Corporation, (i) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check
representing the applicable amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.4 and (ii) the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the
Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each such Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the applicable Merger Consideration.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate but may, if required by the Paying Agent, be required to deliver an executed Letter of Transmittal to the
Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II. Each holder
of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
shall automatically upon the Effective Time or following the Paying Agent’s receipt of the applicable Letter of Transmittal (or, at
any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after such time, the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Article II and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall immediately be canceled.

 

 
(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company maintained by its

transfer agent, the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration may be

paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent properly endorsed or
accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents
reasonably required by the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable Taxes have
been paid.

Section 2.3 No Further Ownership Rights.

All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares and, after the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenter Shares.

Section 2.4 Termination of Exchange Fund.

Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed
to the former Company Shareholders on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent (or its
designee) upon demand, and any former holder of Shares who has not theretofore received any applicable Merger Consideration to which
such Company Shareholder is entitled under this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of claims with respect thereto and only as a general creditor thereof.

Section 2.5 No Liability.

None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Merger Sub shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any part of the Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of any such Shares two years after the Effective Time or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law or Order, become the property of Parent (or its designee) free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their
successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.6 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, or the execution and delivery by such
Person of an indemnity agreement in such form as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, in each case as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration.

Section 2.7 Withholding of Tax.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Plan of Merger, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate
thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Shares, Dissenter Shares, Restricted Share Units or Options, such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate
thereof or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation,

any Affiliate thereof, or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be (a) paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity in
accordance with applicable Law and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be.

Article III. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as (i) disclosed in any Company Report filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by the Company since January 1, 2015 and

Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) has full corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and assets and to conduct its business as presently conducted, except where any failure to have such power or authority would

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) The Company has heretofore furnished or otherwise made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Company
Articles of Incorporation and Company Bylaws. The Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of the Company

policy or arrangement; and each employment, severance, change in control or consulting agreement, in each case, for any
current, retired or former employee or director, or other individual service provider (or for any dependent or beneficiary thereof),
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each such current, retired or former employee, director, or other individual service
provider, a “Company Employee”) that does not constitute an “employee benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA),
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries presently sponsors, participates in, is a party or contributes to (or is required to
contribute to), or with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to have any liability
(whether or not material, each, a “Benefit Plan”). Each of the Benefit Plans that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code is hereinafter referred to in this Section 3.13 as a “Title IV Plan”.

 

 

(b) With respect to each Benefit Plan, the Company has made available to Parent a true and complete copy of each Benefit Plan,
including any amendments thereto, and a true and complete copy of the following items (in each case, only if applicable) (i) each
trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each summary plan description and summary of material modifications, (iii) the most
recently filed annual report on IRS Form 5500, (iv) the most recent financial statements and actuarial or other valuation reports
prepared with respect thereto, and (v) the most recently received IRS determination or opinion letter.

 

 

(c) Except as disclosed in Section 3.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any Person that is a member

group” with the Company, in each case, as defined in Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, an “ERISA Affiliate”)
maintains, contributes to, or sponsors (or has in the past six years maintained, contributed to, or sponsored) a multiemployer plan
as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a “Multiemployer Plan”). All required contributions that the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate have been obligated to make to any Multiemployer Plan have been duly and timely made. Neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has incurred any withdrawal liability with respect to any Multiemployer Plan. No Multiemployer Plan is a Title
IV Plan.

 

 

(d) With regard to each Title IV Plan that is not a Multiemployer Plan, no liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been
incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their
ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability, other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(which premiums have been paid when due). With respect to each Title IV Plan set forth on Section 3.13(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter that is not a Multiemployer Plan: (i) there has not been any failure to satisfy the minimum funding standards
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, and no such plan is in “at risk,”
“endangered” or “critical” status within the meaning of Sections 430 and 432 of the Code; (ii) there has been no “reportable
event” within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder which has not been fully and accurately
reported in a timely fashion, as required by applicable Law; and (iii) there has not been a partial termination.

 

 

(e) Other than with respect to any Multiemployer Plan (as to which the Company makes no representation or warranty), each
Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable law,
including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
actions, suits, disputes or claims by or on behalf of any Benefit Plan, by any Company Employee or beneficiary covered under
any such Benefit Plan, as applicable, or otherwise involving any such Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits). Each
Benefit Plan that constitutes a “nonqualified deferred compensation plan” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code is in
documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code and all applicable IRS guidance thereunder so as to
avoid any interest, penalty or Tax under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its qualification, (ii) the trusts maintained thereunder have been
determined to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and (iii) no event has occurred that could reasonably
be expected to result in disqualification or adversely affect such exemption.

 

 
(g) Other than with respect to any Multiemployer Plan (as to which the Company makes no representation or warranty), no Benefit

Plan provides welfare benefits, including death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), beyond retirement or termination of
service, other than coverage mandated solely by applicable Law.

 

 

(h) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of Merger will not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any Company Employee to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other
payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting, or
funding, or increase the amount of compensation due any such Company Employee.

 

 
(i) No amounts payable under the Benefit Plans will fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G

of the Code as a result of the occurrence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or in combination with
another event.

Section 3.14 Labor Relations.
 

 

(a) There is no labor strike, dispute, slowdown, stoppage or lockout actually pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, since January 1, 2014, there has not been any such
action. Except as listed in Section 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are
(a) party to any collective bargaining agreements or similar labor agreements, (b) subject to any action, complaint, charge,
inquiry, proceeding or investigation brought, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by or on behalf of any employee,
prospective employee, former employee, labor organization or other representative of the Company’s employees, which action,
complaint, charge, inquiry, proceeding or investigation, if adversely decided, may reasonably, individually or in the aggregate,
create a Liability material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (c) any grievance or arbitration proceeding
whether pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened which, if adversely decided, may reasonably, individually or
in the aggregate, create a Liability material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or cause the Company to incur
expenses or forego operating savings which would be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (d) a party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any
Governmental Entity relating to employees or employment practices. The Company and its Subsidiaries are, and have at all
times been, in material compliance with all applicable Laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment, wages, hours of work and occupational safety and health, and are not engaged in any unfair labor
practices as defined in the National Labor Relations Act, the Railway Labor Act or other applicable Law. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no Governmental Entity responsible for the enforcement of labor or employment Laws intends to conduct an
investigation with respect to or relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and no such investigation is in progress.

 

 

(b) Since January 1, 2015, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not effectuated (i) a “plant closing” as defined in the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (or similar state or local laws) (the “WARN Act”) affecting any site of
employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment or facility of the Company or any
Subsidiary, or (ii) a “mass layoff” as defined in the WARN Act affecting any site of employment or facility of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2014, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have been affected by any
transaction or engaged in layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in number to trigger application of any Law similar to
the WARN Act.

subject, however, to Antitrust Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
obligated to provide any such access or information to the extent that doing so (i) would be reasonably likely to cause a waiver
of an attorney-client privilege or loss of attorney work product protection, (ii) would constitute a violation of any applicable Law
or (iii) would violate any agreement in effect on the date hereof with a third-party to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party (it being agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such access or information
to be provided in a manner that does not cause such waiver, loss or violation including by making substitute arrangements).
Neither Parent nor any of its Representatives shall be permitted to perform any onsite procedure (including any intrusive onsite
environmental investigation), other than ordinary course operational visits for integration planning, with respect to any property
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the Company’s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

shall cause their respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives to hold, all
information received, directly or indirectly, from the Company or its Representatives in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms;
provided, however, that any use restrictions or other similar limitations set forth therein shall be inapplicable with respect to any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any proposal, negotiations or actions by or on behalf of Parent related to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including in response to a notice pursuant to Section 5.6).

with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions applicable to such party pursuant
to this Agreement and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining all necessary, proper or advisable actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents, qualifications and approvals from Governmental Entities and making all necessary, proper or advisable
registrations, filings and notices and taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, waiver or exemption from any
Governmental Entity (including under, if applicable, the HSR Act, and from the STB); (ii) obtaining all necessary, proper or
advisable consents, qualifications, approvals, waivers or exemptions from non-

governmental Third Parties; and (iii) executing and delivering any additional documents or instruments necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, the Transaction Documents.

 

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall, as soon as possible but in any event within fifteen
(15) Business Days of the date hereof, file with the STB the appropriate and necessary documentation for the approval or
exemption, as the case may be, of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent also shall, as soon as possible
following such filing, submit a form of voting trust agreement to the STB seeking a written informal opinion that the voting trust
would insulate Parent from unauthorized control of the Company if (i) Parent has not received from the STB the approval or
exemption, as the case may be, of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby before the Effective Time and (ii) the
stock of the Surviving Corporation is placed into the voting trust immediately following the Effective Time. Parent shall bear its
own costs for the preparation of such filings and responding to any inquiries or information requests, if applicable, and Parent
shall be responsible for the payment of any applicable filing fees. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another (A) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain
timely any such approval or exemption, and (B) in keeping the other party reasonably informed of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the STB, regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to Section 5.3(c), Parent and the Company shall permit the Company and Parent, respectively, to
review prior to filing, all documents proposed by Parent or Merger Sub or the Company, respectively, to be filed with the STB,
any other Governmental Entity or any court to secure approval or exemption of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

(c) In addition to and without limiting the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one another (i) in
promptly determining whether any filings or other submissions are required to be or should be made or consents, approvals,
permits or authorizations are required to be or should be obtained under the HSR Act or any other federal, state or foreign Law
or regulation or whether any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or should be obtained from other parties to loan
agreements or other contracts or instruments material to the Company’s business in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing information required in
connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers, and (iii) in
keeping the other party reasonably informed, including by providing the other party with a copy of any communication received
by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental Entity, of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 5.3 as “Antitrust Counsel Only Material.” Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the Antitrust Law outside counsel of the recipient and will
not be disclosed by outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the recipient or any of its Affiliates unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent as the case may be) or its
legal counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall direct their respective Antitrust Law outside counsels to comply with this
Section 5.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.3, materials provided to the other party or its counsel may
be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and privileged communications.

 

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.3, if any objections are asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as

violative of any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) resolve
any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in
order to resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) avoid or
eliminate impediments under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Termination Date),
including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom of Parent
or its Subsidiaries’ (including the Surviving Corporation’s) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more
of its or its Subsidiaries’ (including the Surviving Corporation’s) businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in

(f) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) against Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective directors or officers by a Governmental Entity challenging the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other, and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(g) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notify Parent of (i) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) any actions, suits, claims, litigations, investigations or
proceedings, including any shareholder litigation, commenced, threatened or, to its Knowledge, contemplated against, relating to
or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of its or their officers or the Company Board of
Directors, that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to this
Agreement, or that relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof, including by promptly (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) providing Parent copies of all proceedings and correspondence relating to such action, suit, claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding. The Company shall reasonably consult with Parent with respect to (and allow Parent to
participate in), and shall consider in good faith Parent’s advice with respect to, the defense or settlement of any such action, suit,
claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding, and no settlement, agreement to settle or action taken to settle thereof shall be

Meeting; provided, however, that (A) the Company Shareholders Meeting shall in no event be adjourned or postponed pursuant to clause

the Company has not breached its obligations under this Section 5.6 and if the Company Board of Directors determines (x) after
consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (y) after consultation with, and taking into account the
advice of, its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, the Company may (and may authorize and permit its Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and Representatives to),
subject to compliance with Section 5.6(d), (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing

Directors or any such committee of this Agreement, the Plan of Merger or the Merger (or take any other action or make any
other public statement inconsistent with such recommendation) or (B) recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve or
adopt, or publicly propose to recommend, approve or adopt, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as an “Adverse Recommendation Change”), (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or

the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Required Vote, and subject to compliance with this Section 5.6, the Company Board of Directors may, if, after
consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside counsel, it determines that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, in response to a bona fide Takeover Proposal which did not
result from a breach of Section 5.6 and which the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor and its outside counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, (1) make an Adverse Recommendation Change
or (2) cause or permit the Company to terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement regarding such
Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company Board of Directors shall not make an Adverse Recommendation
Change, and the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (2) above, until after the third Business Day
following Parent’s receipt of written notice (a “Notice of Superior Proposal”) from the Company advising Parent that the
Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the material terms and
conditions of (and documents relating to) any Superior Proposal (and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal)
that is the basis of the proposed action by such Company Board of Directors and a statement that the Company Board of
Directors intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) and during such three Business Day period, if requested
by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to,
among other things, amend this Agreement and the Transaction Documents in such a manner that (i) any Takeover Proposal
which was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure of the Company
Board of Directors to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that (I) any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new three (3) Business Day period
and (II) in determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or to cause or permit the Company to so terminate
this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors shall take into account any changes to the financial or other terms of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents proposed by Parent to the Company in response to a Notice of Superior
Proposal or otherwise, and the Company Board of Directors at the end of the negotiation period, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor, shall have in good faith reaffirmed its determination that such bona fide Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal).

fiduciary duties under applicable Law in response to an Intervening Event, make an Adverse Recommendation Change;
provided, however, that the Company Board of Directors shall not make such an Adverse Recommendation Change until after
the third Business Day following Parent’s receipt of written notice (a “Notice of Intervening Event”) from the Company advising
Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, which notice shall
include a description of the applicable Intervening Event, and during such three Business Day period, if

requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its
Representatives to, among other things, amend this Agreement and the Transaction Documents in such a manner that (i) the need
for making such Adverse Recommendation Change is obviated and (ii) the failure of the Company Board of Directors to make
such Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being
understood and agreed that (I) any material change in respect of such Intervening Event shall require a new Notice of Intervening
Event and a new three (3) Business Day period and (II) in determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change,
the Company Board of Directors shall take into account any changes to the financial or other terms of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents proposed by Parent to the Company in response to a Notice of Intervening Event or otherwise).

Takeover Proposal after the date of this Agreement, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal or request
for information or other inquiry (including copies of any written proposal or inquiry related thereto) and the identity of the
Person making any such Takeover Proposal or request for information or other inquiry. The Company shall, subject to the

developments with respect to any such Takeover Proposal or request for information or other inquiry (including any material
changes thereto).

disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any “stop-look-and-listen”
communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or any
similar disclosure to its shareholders if the Company Board of Directors determines (after consultation with its outside counsel)
that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; provided that it shall be an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board of Directors expressly publicly reaffirms the Recommendation in such
disclosure or communication (other than a customary “stop-look-and-listen” communication to the shareholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act), it being understood, however, that clause (ii) of this Section 5.6(e) shall not
be deemed to permit the Company Board of Directors to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or take any of the actions
referred to in clause (ii) of Section 5.6(b) except, in each case, to the extent permitted by Section 5.6(b).

Section 5.7 Public Announcements.

consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without the
prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required by Law or Order, the applicable

Employees”) and who remain employees of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries during the
Continuation Period, (i) base salary, and annual incentive bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than the base salary and
target bonus opportunities applicable to such Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee
benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such Transferred Employees immediately

Law.

pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall be credited towards any payments to such employees as required by any Law or any other
applicable agreement.

terms are defined in the ESPP) at the time of such suspension shall be distributed to the applicable Participant in accordance with
section 11 of the ESPP.

 

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations
under the Company Equity Plans and compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately before the Effective Time and the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be deemed to constitute a
“change in control,” “change of control” or “corporate transaction” under such Company Equity Plans, arrangements or
agreements.

 

 

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall be permitted to pay, at or prior to the Effective Time, bonuses based on
services rendered through the Effective Time to such Transferred Employees and officers (whether or not such officers qualify as
Transferred Employees) and in such amount(s) as the Company Board of Directors may determine in its sole discretion, provided
the aggregate amount of such bonuses shall not exceed $350,000.

 

 

(f) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parent’s or the Surviving Corporation’s Subsidiaries, as applicable, to,
give Transferred Employees full credit for such Transferred Employees’ service with the Company and its Subsidiaries for

plans made generally available to employees or officers or any class or level of employees or officers maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which a Transferred Employee participates to the same extent
recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

Employees may be eligible to participate following the Effective Time, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect
to such employees as of the Effective Time under the analogous Benefit Plan,

(ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Transferred Employees and their eligible
dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Effective Time during the portion of the
plan year prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which they are eligible to participate after the
Effective Time in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred and
(iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a
Transferred Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such
Transferred Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Benefit Plan
prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no current or former employee, director or individual independent
contractor or any individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purposes as a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Transferred Employee or any other
Person any benefits under any benefit plans, programs, policies or other arrangements, including severance benefits or the right
to employment or continued employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates
for any period by reason of this Agreement. No provision of this Section 5.8 constitutes an employment agreement or an
amendment to or adoption of any employee benefit plan of or by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries
or Affiliates or shall alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them in accordance with the terms of such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and applicable Law.
Following the Effective Time, nothing contained in this Section 5.8 shall interfere with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Subsidiaries’ or Affiliates’ right to terminate the employment of any employee for any reason.

Section 5.9 Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance.
 

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and present officers and
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the “Indemnified Parties”) for acts or omissions related to such Indemnified
Party’s service as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest
extent permitted by the RIBCA or any other applicable Law or provided under the Company Articles of Incorporation and the
Company Bylaws in effect on the date hereof; provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from
time to time under applicable Law.

 

 

(b) From the Effective Time and for a period of six (6) years thereafter, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain in effect directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy
(a copy of which has been made available or delivered to Parent) on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such current insurance coverage; provided, however, that in no event will Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance, which annual premiums currently paid are set forth on Section 5.9(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the “Maximum Premium”); and provided, further, that, if the annual premiums for such insurance coverage exceed the
Maximum Premium, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount; and provided, further, however, that at Parent’s option in lieu of the foregoing
insurance coverage, the Company shall purchase prior to the Effective Time six (6) year “tail” insurance coverage that provides
coverage identical in all material respects to the coverage described above, provided that the Company does not pay more than
the Maximum Premium.

(c) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of the current or former directors
or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
in effect on the date of this Agreement and furnished to Parent prior to the date hereof shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. Further, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or
present directors and officers than are presently set forth in the Company Articles of Incorporation and Company Bylaws, which

manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals, except as amendments may be required by the

indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise.

shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9. In addition, the
Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.9.

Section 5.10 No Control of the Other Party’s Business.

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company’s or its
Subsidiaries’ operations prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct Parent’s or its Subsidiaries’ operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the
Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

Section 5.11 Anti-Takeover Statutes.

If any Anti-Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to this Agreement (including the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby) or any other Transaction Document (including the transactions contemplated thereby), each of the Company and
Parent and their respective boards of directors shall grant all such approvals and take all such actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable hereafter on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which such Shares have
been converted, as provided herein.

Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto. Each Share owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company

CONFIDENTIAL

The Board of Directors
Providence and Worcester Railroad Company
75 Hammond Street
Worcester, MA 01610

Dear Members of the Board of Directors:

We understand that Genesee & Wyoming Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries and affiliates, the “Acquiror”),
Pullman Acquisition Sub Inc., a Rhode Island corporation and a subsidiary of the Acquiror (the “Sub”), and Providence and Worcester
Railroad Company, a Rhode Island corporation (the “Company”), propose to enter into the Agreement (defined below) pursuant to which,
among other things, the Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Transaction”) and that, in connection with the Transaction, (a)
each of the 640 outstanding shares of preferred stock, par value $50.00 per share (“Company Preferred Stock”), of the Company will be
converted (the “Preferred Stock Conversion”) into 100 shares of Company Common Stock (as defined below), (b) after the Preferred Stock
Conversion, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.50 per share (“Company Common Stock”), of the Company (other than
those owned by the Acquiror, the Sub or any other subsidiary of the Acquiror) will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash (the
“Proposed Consideration”), and (c) the Company will become the surviving corporation. “Excluded Persons” means the Robert H. Eder
Trust and the Linda Eder Trust.

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company has requested that BMO Capital Markets Corp. (“BMOCM”) render an opinion, as
investment bankers, to the Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than
the Excluded Persons), of the Proposed Consideration to be received by such holders in the Transaction pursuant to the Agreement (the
“Opinion”).

For purposes of this Opinion, we have reviewed the draft dated August 12, 2016 of the Merger Agreement by and among the Acquiror, Sub
and the Company (the “Draft Agreement”). We have assumed that the final Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the Draft
Agreement, and will reflect the terms of the Draft Agreement.

In connection with this Opinion, we have made such reviews, analyses and inquiries as we have deemed necessary and appropriate under
the circumstances. Among other things, we have:
 

 1) reviewed the Draft Agreement;
 

 2) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we deemed to be relevant;
 

 
3) reviewed certain information relating to the historical, current and future operations, financial condition and prospects of the

Company made available to us by the Company, including financial projections prepared by the management of the Company
relating to the Company for the fiscal years ending 2016 through 2020;

 

 
4) conducted discussions with members of senior management of the Company and certain of its representatives and advisors

concerning their view of the Company’s businesses, operations, financial condition and prospects, the Transaction and related
matters;

 5) reviewed certain financial and stock market information for selected publicly traded companies that we deemed to be relevant;
 

 
6) reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisitions of companies in the Company’s industry

which we deemed to be relevant;
 

 7) performed discounted cash flow analyses for the Company based on the Company’s management projections;
 

 
8) reviewed a certificate addressed to us from senior management of the Company which contains, among other things,

representations regarding the accuracy of the information, data and other materials (financial or otherwise) provided to, or
discussed with, us by or on behalf of the Company; and

 

 9) performed such other studies and analyses, and conducted such discussions as we deemed appropriate.

We have assumed and relied on the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to us by the
Company or its representatives or advisors, the Acquiror or its representatives or advisors, or obtained by us from other sources. We have
not independently verified (nor assumed any obligation to verify) any such information, undertaken an independent valuation or appraisal of
the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or the Acquiror, nor have we been furnished with any such valuation or
appraisal. We have not evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Acquiror or the Company under any state or federal laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We also have assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents
required in connection with the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained and that in connection with obtaining any necessary
governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents, no restrictions, terms, or conditions will be imposed that would be material to our
analysis. We have has also assumed that the Transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, without any
waiver, modification or amendment of any terms, condition or agreement that would be material to our analysis, that the representations and
warranties of each party contained in the Agreement will be true and correct in all material respects, that each party will perform all of the
covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the
Transaction will be satisfied without waiver or modification. With respect to financial projections for the Company, we have been advised
by the Company, and we have assumed, without independent investigation, that they have been reasonably prepared and reflect the best
currently available estimates and good faith judgment of Company management of the expected future competitive, operating and
regulatory environments and related financial performance of the Company. We express no opinion with respect to such projections, or the
assumptions on which they are based. We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that there has been no change in
the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of the Company since the respective dates
of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise, provided to us that would be material to our analyses
or this Opinion, and that there is no information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by us incomplete or
misleading. Furthermore, we have not assumed any obligation to conduct, and have not conducted, any physical inspection of the properties
or facilities of, or managed by, the Company or the Acquiror.

This Opinion is necessarily based upon financial, economic, market and other conditions and circumstances as they exist, and the
information made available to us, as of the date hereof. We have not undertaken, and are under no obligation, to update, revise, reaffirm or
withdraw this Opinion, or otherwise comment on or consider events occurring or coming to our attention after the date hereof.

This Opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to any action the Board or any other party should take in connection with the
Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement or any aspect thereof and is not a recommendation to any director of
the Company, any security holder or any other party on how to act or vote with respect to the Transaction or related transactions and
proposals or any other matter. This Opinion relates solely to the fairness of the Proposed Consideration, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of the Company Common Stock (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes the Company Preferred Stock on an as-converted
basis) other than the Excluded Persons. We express no opinion herein as to the relative merits of the

Transaction and any other transactions or business strategies discussed by the Board as alternatives to the Transaction or the decision of the
Board to proceed with the Transaction, nor do we express any opinion on the structure, terms or effect of any other aspect of the Transaction
or the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement. In addition, we do not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or
otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of the Company’s officers, directors, or
employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction relative to the Proposed Consideration to be received by holders
of Company Common Stock. We are not experts in, and this Opinion does not address, any of the legal, tax or accounting aspects of the
Transaction, including, without limitation, whether or not the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement
constitute a change of control under any contract or agreement to which the Company, or any of their respective subsidiaries is a party. We
have relied solely on the Company’s legal, tax and accounting advisors for such matters.

BMOCM has acted as financial advisor to the Board with respect to the Transaction and will receive a fee for our services, a substantial
portion of which is contingent upon successful consummation of the Transaction. In addition, we will receive a fee for rendering this
Opinion, which is not contingent upon the successful completion of the Transaction. The Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our
expenses and to indemnify us and certain related parties against certain potential liabilities arising out of our engagement. BMOCM, as part
of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of business, certain of our employees and affiliates, as well as
investment funds in which they may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may acquire, hold or sell, long or short
positions, or trade, in debt, equity, and other securities and financial instruments (including loans and other obligations) of, or investments
in, the Company, the Acquiror or any other party that may be involved in the Transaction and their respective affiliates or any currency or
commodity that may be involved in the Transaction.

In the two years prior to the date of this Opinion, BMOCM has not had any material relationships, nor are any material relationships
mutually understood to be contemplated, in which any compensation was received or is intended to be received by BMOCM as a result of
any such relationship with the Acquiror in connection with the provision of any financial advisory or financing services by BMOCM to the
Acquiror. BMOCM provides a full range of financial advisory and securities services and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may
from time to time effect transactions and hold securities, including, without limitation, derivative securities, of the Company, the Acquiror
or their respective affiliates for its own account and for the accounts of customers.

This Opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of BMOCM. This Opinion has been prepared at the request and for the
benefit and use of the Board (in its capacity as such) in evaluating the fairness of the Proposed Consideration, from a financial point of view,
to the holders of Company Common Stock other than the Excluded Persons and may not be used for any other purpose without our prior
written consent. This Opinion may not be disclosed, in whole or in part, or summarized, excerpted from or otherwise referred to without our
prior written consent except that this Opinion may be reproduced in full or summarized in any disclosure document required to be filed by
the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the Transaction, provided that any summary of this Opinion is
in a form acceptable to BMOCM and its counsel.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, it is our opinion, as investment bankers, that as of the date hereof, the
Proposed Consideration to be received by the holders of Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded Persons) in the Transaction
pursuant to the Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

Very truly yours,

ANNEX D

CHAPTER 7-1.2
Rhode Island Business Corporation Act

Dissenters’ Rights
Sections 7-1.2-1201 and 7-1.2-1202

§ 7-1.2-1201 Right of shareholders to dissent. – (a) Any shareholder of a corporation has the right to dissent from any of the
following corporate actions:

(1) Any plan of merger to which the corporation is a party, provided articles of merger have been filed in connection with the
transaction under § 7-1.2-1003, unless the corporation is the surviving corporation in a merger and the approval of its shareholders was not
required by virtue of the provisions of either § 7-1.2-1002 or § 7-1.2-1004; or

(2) Any sale or exchange of all or substantially all of the property and assets of a corporation which requires the approval of the
shareholders under § 7-1.2-1102.

(b) A shareholder may not dissent as to less than all of the shares registered in his or her name which are owned beneficially by him or
her. A nominee or fiduciary may not dissent on behalf of any beneficial owner as to less than all of the shares of the owner registered in the
name of the nominee or fiduciary.

(c) Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation of the issuing corporation, there is no right to dissent for the holders of
the shares of any class or series which, on the date fixed to determine the shareholders entitled to receive notice of the proposed transaction
(or a copy of the agreement of merger under § 7-1.2-1004), were:

(1) Registered on a national securities exchange or included as national market securities in the national association of securities
dealers automated quotations system or any successor national market system; or

(2) Held of record by not less than two thousand (2,000) shareholders.

(d) A shareholder entitled to the right to dissent under this section may not challenge a completed corporate action for which the right
to dissent is available unless such corporate action:

(1) Was not effectuated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this chapter or the corporation’s articles of incorporation,
bylaws or board of directors’ resolution authorizing the corporate action; or

(2) Was procured as a result of fraud or material misrepresentation.

§ 7-1.2-1202 Rights of dissenting shareholders. – (a) Any shareholder electing to exercise the right of dissent shall file with the
corporation, prior to or at the meeting of shareholders at which the proposed corporate action is submitted to a vote, a written objection to
the proposed corporate action. If the proposed corporate action is approved by the required vote and the shareholder has not voted in favor
of it, the shareholder may, within ten (10) days after the date on which the vote was taken, or if a corporation is to be merged without a vote
of its shareholders into another corporation, any of its shareholders may, within fifteen (15) days after the plan of the merger has been
mailed to the shareholders, make written demand on the corporation, or, in the case of a merger, on the surviving or new corporation,
domestic or foreign, for payment of the fair value of the shareholder’s shares. If the proposed corporate action is effected, the corporation
shall pay to the shareholder, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares, the fair value of the shares as of the day

Table of Contents

prior to the date on which the vote was taken approving the proposed corporate action, excluding any appreciation or depreciation in
anticipation of the corporate action. Any shareholder failing to make demand within the ten (10) day period or the fifteen (15) day period, as
the case may be, is bound by the terms of the proposed corporate action. Any shareholder making the demand is thereafter only entitled to
payment as provided in this section and is not entitled to vote or to exercise any other rights of a shareholder.

(b) No demand may be withdrawn unless the corporation consents to it. If, however, the demand is withdrawn upon consent, or if the
proposed corporate action is abandoned or rescinded or the shareholders revoke the authority to effect the action, or if, in the case of a
merger, on the date of the filing of the articles of merger the surviving corporation is the owner of all the outstanding shares of the other
corporations, domestic and foreign, that are parties to the merger, or if no demand or petition for the determination of fair value by a court
has been made or filed within the time provided in this section, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the shareholder is not
entitled to the relief provided by this section, then the right of the shareholder to be paid the fair value of his or her shares ceases and his
status as a shareholder is restored, without prejudice to any corporate proceedings taken during the interim.

(c) Within ten (10) days after the corporate action is effected, the corporation, or, in the case of a merger, the surviving or new
corporation, domestic or foreign, shall give written notice of the action to each dissenting shareholder who has made demand as provided in
these provisions, and shall make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to pay for the shares at a specified price deemed by the
corporation to be the fair value of the shares. The notice and offer must be accompanied by a balance sheet of the corporation the shares of
which the dissenting shareholder holds, as of the latest available date and not more than twelve (12) months prior to the making of the offer,
and a profit and loss statement of the corporation for the twelve (12) month period ended on the date of the balance sheet.

(d) If within thirty (30) days after the date on which the corporate action was effected the fair value of the shares is agreed upon
between any dissenting shareholder and the corporation, payment for the shares must be made within ninety (90) days after the date on
which the corporate action was effected, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares. Upon payment of the agreed
value, the dissenting shareholder ceases to have any interest in the shares.

(e) If within the period of thirty (30) days a dissenting shareholder and the corporation do not agree on the matter, then the
corporation, within thirty (30) days after receipt of written request for the filing from any dissenting shareholder given within sixty
(60) days after the date on which the corporate action was effected, shall, or at its election at any time within the period of sixty (60) days
may, file a petition in any court of competent jurisdiction in the county in this state where the registered office of the corporation is located
praying that the fair value of the shares is found and determined. If, in the case of a merger, the surviving or new corporation is a foreign
corporation without a registered office in this state, the petition must be filed in the county where the registered office of the domestic
corporation was last located. If the corporation fails to institute the proceeding as provided, any dissenting shareholder may do so in the
name of the corporation. All dissenting shareholders, wherever they reside, must be made parties to the proceeding as an action against their
shares quasi in rem. A copy of the petition must be served on each dissenting shareholder who is a resident of this state and served by
registered or certified mail on each dissenting shareholder who is a nonresident. Service on nonresidents may also be made by publication as
provided by law. The jurisdiction of the court is plenary and exclusive. All shareholders who are parties to the proceeding are entitled to
judgment against the corporation for the amount of the fair value of their shares. The court may, if it so elects, appoint one or more persons
as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers have the power and authority that
is specified in the order of their appointment or an amendment of the order. The judgment is payable only upon and concurrently with the
surrender to the corporation of the certificate or certificates representing the shares. Upon payment of the judgment, the dissenting
shareholder ceases to have any interest in the shares.

Table of Contents

(f) The judgment should include an allowance for interest at the rate of interest on judgments in civil actions from the date on which
the vote was taken on the proposed corporate action to the date of payment.

(g) The court shall determine and assess the costs and expenses of any proceeding against the corporation, but all or any part of the
costs and expenses may be apportioned and assessed as the court deems equitable against any or all of the dissenting shareholders who are
parties to the proceeding to whom the corporation has made an offer to pay for the shares if the court finds that the action of the
shareholders in failing to accept the offer was arbitrary or vexatious or not in good faith. The expenses include reasonable compensation for
and reasonable expenses of the appraisers, but exclude the fees and expenses of counsel for and experts employed by any party; but if the
fair value of the shares as determined materially exceeds the amount which the corporation offered to pay for the shares, or if no offer was
made, the court in its discretion may award to any shareholder who is a party to the proceeding a sum that the court determines to be
reasonable compensation to any expert or experts employed by the shareholder in the proceeding.

(h) Within twenty (20) days after demanding payment for his shares, each shareholder demanding payment shall submit the certificate
or certificates representing his shares to the corporation for notation on the certificate that the demand has been made. His or her failure to
do so may, at the option of the corporation, terminate his or her rights under this section unless a court of competent jurisdiction, for good
and sufficient cause shown, directs otherwise. If shares represented by a certificate on which notation has been made are transferred, each
new certificate issued for the shares must bear similar notation, together with the name of the original dissenting holder of the shares, and a
transferee of the shares acquires by the transfer no rights in the corporation other than those which the original dissenting shareholder had
after making demand for payment of the fair value of the shares.

(i) Shares acquired by a corporation pursuant to payment of the agreed value for the shares or to payment of the judgment entered for
the shares, as provided in this section, may be held and disposed of by the corporation. However, in the case of a merger, they may be held
and disposed of as the plan of merger otherwise provides.

The undersigned hereby authorizes and appoints Robert H. Eder, P. Scott Conti, and Daniel T. Noreck, and each of them acting singly, with full power of
substitution in each, as proxies to vote all shares of common stock, par value $.50 per share, of Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (the “Company”)
held of record on September 16, 2016 by the undersigned at the Special Meeting of Shareholders to be held at 10:00 a.m. local time, on October 26, 2016, at

In connection with those shares (if any) held as a participant in the Providence and Worcester Railroad Company Profit-Sharing Plan (the “Plan”), the
