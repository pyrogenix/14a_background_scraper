Lattice Semiconductor Corporation

January 27, 2017

To the Stockholders of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the
“Special Meeting”, of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, a Delaware corporation, which we refer to in this proxy statement
as “Lattice”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”, to be held on February 28, 2017 at 8:00 am, Pacific time, at our principal
executive offices, located on the 8th floor of the US Bancorp Tower, 111 SW 5th Ave., Portland, Oregon 97204.

At the Special Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
as it may be amended from time to time, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Merger Agreement”, dated
November 3, 2016, among Lattice, Canyon Bridge Acquisition Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which we refer to in
this proxy statement as “Parent”, and Canyon Bridge Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, which we refer to in this proxy statement as “Merger Sub.” Upon the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to the closing set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will, at the closing, merge with and into Lattice,
which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Merger”, and Lattice will become a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent. You will also be asked to consider and vote on a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will
or may become payable to Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $8.30 in cash, without interest, for each share of Lattice common
stock that you own (unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights), which represents a premium of
approximately 30% to the closing price of Lattice’s common stock on November 2, 2016, the last trading day prior to the
date on which Lattice entered into the Merger Agreement and the proposed Merger was publicly announced.

The Board of Directors of Lattice, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Board”, after considering the
factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, has unanimously determined that the Merger
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and in the best
interests of Lattice and its stockholders, and adopted and approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Board unanimously recommends that you vote
“FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement, “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time
of the Special Meeting, and “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may
become payable to Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the Special Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the
Merger. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement. The proxy statement also
describes the actions and determinations of the Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the
Merger. We encourage you to read the proxy statement and its annexes, including the Merger Agreement, carefully and in
their entirety, as they contain important information.

Except as otherwise specifically noted in this proxy statement, “Lattice”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, “us” and similar
words refer to Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, including, in certain cases, our subsidiaries. Throughout this proxy
statement, we refer to Canyon Bridge Acquisition Company, Inc. as “Parent” and Canyon Bridge Merger Sub, Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, as “Merger Sub.” In addition, throughout this proxy statement we refer to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 3, 2016, among Lattice, Parent, and Merger Sub, and as it may be
amended from time to time, as the “Merger Agreement.”

Parties Involved in the Merger

Table of Contents

Sponsor: Canyon Bridge Fund I, LP
Canyon Bridge, an affiliate of CBC Partners, is a recently established private equity buyout fund focused on technology
companies. Canyon Bridge has one limited partner, a wholly owned subsidiary of China Venture Capital Fund
Corporation Limited, a large Chinese investment fund, which we refer to in this proxy statement as “CVC.” Canyon
Bridge has entered into an equity commitment letter, dated as of November 3, 2016, which we refer to in this proxy
statement as the “Equity Commitment Letter”, with Parent, pursuant to which, subject to certain conditions, Canyon
Bridge has agreed to provide or cause to be provided the equity financing necessary for Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger.

The Merger
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub will be
merged with and into Lattice, and Lattice will continue as the surviving corporation as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Surviving Corporation.” As a result of the Merger, Lattice will
cease to be a publicly traded company, and each outstanding share of Lattice common stock will be canceled and
converted into the right to receive $8.30 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes,
which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Per Share Merger Consideration”, other than (1) any shares owned by
stockholders who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights under the Delaware General Corporation
Law, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “DGCL”, and (2) shares held by Lattice as treasury stock or
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or a subsidiary of Lattice, which will be canceled for no consideration.

After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but you will no
longer own any shares of the common stock of the Surviving Corporation and you will no longer have any rights as a
stockholder (except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a
payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by
Delaware law, as described below under the caption “The Merger — Appraisal Rights”).

Treatment of Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units
Stock Options

At the effective time of the Merger, which will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or at such later date and time as the Company and Parent may agree upon and as is set forth
in that certificate of merger, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Effective Time”, each option to purchase
shares of Lattice common stock, each of which we refer to in this proxy statement as a “Company Stock Option”,
granted under any of the Company’s equity incentive plans, each of which we refer to in this proxy statement as a
“Company Stock Plan”, with an exercise price per share less than $8.30, which we refer to in this proxy statement as
an “In-the-Money Company Option”, that is vested (after taking into account the measurement of any corporate
performance goals that are required to be measured under the terms of such Company Stock Option and any
accelerated vesting that is required to occur at or prior to the Effective Time) and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, which we refer to in this proxy statement as a “Vested Company Option”, will be canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any required
withholding tax) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of Lattice common stock subject
to such Vested Company Option by (2) the amount by which $8.30 exceeds the per share exercise price of such

Table of Contents

Vested Company Option, which cash amount will be paid as soon as administratively practicable, but not later than 10
business days following the Effective Time.

At the Effective Time, each outstanding In-the-Money Company Option that is not a Vested Company Option, which we
refer to in this proxy statement as an “Unvested Company Option”, will be canceled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of Lattice common stock subject to such Unvested Company
Option by (2) the amount by which $8.30 exceeds the per share exercise price of such Unvested Company Option,
which cash amount will be payable in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such Unvested Company
Option as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the Unvested Company Option holder’s continued
service on each applicable vesting date. As such, if the holder of an Unvested Company Option experiences a
termination of employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or a subsidiary of Parent, as applicable, after the
Effective Time but prior to the date on which that Unvested Company Option becomes fully vested, the holder will
forfeit his or her right to receive any unpaid cash amount in respect of that Unvested Company Option to the extent that
the Unvested Company Option is forfeited upon such termination pursuant to the terms of the Unvested Company
Option, unless such he or she is entitled to acceleration pursuant to terms of an agreement with Lattice.

All Company Options which are not In-the-Money Company Options and any other Company Options that are not
granted under any Company Stock Plan will be canceled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time without payment
of any consideration.

Restricted Stock Units
At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units granted under a Company Stock Plan, each of which we
refer to in this proxy statement as a “Company RSU”, that is outstanding and vested (after taking into account any
accelerated vesting that is required to occur at or prior to the Effective Time under the terms of such Company RSU) as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, which such vested Company RSU we refer to in this proxy statement as a
“Vested RSU”, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject
to deduction for any required withholding tax) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) $8.30 by (2) the number
of shares that are subject to such Vested RSU, which cash amount will become payable in accordance with the
delivery schedule applicable to such Vested RSU as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding and unvested (after taking into account any accelerated
vesting that is required to occur at or prior to the Effective Time under the terms of such Company RSUs) as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which such unvested Company RSU we refer to in this proxy statement as an
“Unvested RSU”, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and
subject to deduction for any required withholding tax) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) $8.30 by (2) the
number of shares that remain subject to such Unvested RSU, which cash amount will vest and become payable in
accordance with the vesting and delivery schedule applicable to such Unvested RSU as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, subject to the Unvested RSU holder’s continued service on each applicable vesting date. As such, if
the holder of an Unvested RSU experiences a termination of employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or a
subsidiary of Parent, as applicable, after the Effective Time but prior to the date on which that Unvested RSU becomes
fully vested, the holder will forfeit his or her right to receive any unpaid cash amount in respect of that Unvested RSU to
the extent that the Unvested RSU is forfeited upon such termination pursuant to the terms of the Unvested RSU,
unless such he or she is entitled to acceleration pursuant to terms of an agreement with Lattice.

Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan
With respect to Lattice’s 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the
“Company ESPP”, no new offering period will commence, no Lattice employee or other person will be permitted to
begin participating in the Company ESPP and no current participants will be permitted to increase elective deferrals in
respect of the current offering period. The offering period in effect on November 3, 2016 will terminate no later than five
days prior to the Effective Time, and amounts credited to the accounts of participants will be used to purchase shares
in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and such shares will be canceled and converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Financing of the Merger
We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions will be
approximately $1.3 billion. In connection with the Merger, Parent entered into the Equity Commitment Letter with
Canyon Bridge pursuant to which Canyon Bridge has committed, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in the Equity Commitment Letter, to purchase or cause to be purchased, immediately prior to the completion of the
Merger, equity interests of Parent for an aggregate purchase price equal to $1.3 billion, which will be used solely for the
purpose of allowing Parent or Merger Sub to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, satisfy all of the
outstanding indebtedness of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the extent required to be repaid in connection
with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and pay any
and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub at the completion of the Merger in connection
with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger — Financing of the Merger.”

Conditions to the Closing of the Merger
The obligations of Lattice, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of certain conditions, including (among other conditions), the following:
 

 •  the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the requisite affirmative vote of Lattice stockholders;
 

 
•  the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust

Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “HSR Act”, which
occurred on January 4, 2017;

 

 •  the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Austrian Competition Act(Wettbewerbsgesetz) and/or the Austrian Cartel Act (Kartellgesetz);
 

 •  the clearance of the Merger by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which we refer toin this proxy statement as “CFIUS”;
 

 
•  the absence of any applicable law or order, whether preliminary, temporary or permanent, that prevents,

makes illegal or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement; and

 

 

•  the absence of any legal action brought by a governmental entity challenging or seeking to restrain, prohibit,
rescind or unwind the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or the ability of Parent to (1) acquire, hold or exercise full right of ownership of Lattice or its
subsidiaries or (2) control the business or operations of Lattice or its subsidiaries (however, Parent has
agreed to accept certain conditions that may be imposed by CFIUS as a prerequisite for its clearance of the
Merger, as described in the section captioned “The Merger — Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
— CFIUS”).

adverse effect standards or certain dollar thresholds as described under the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Closing of the Merger”;

 

 •  performance by Lattice in all material respects of its obligations under the Merger Agreement;
 

 •  the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect; and
 

 •  the receipt of an officer’s certificate certifying that the foregoing conditions have been satisfied.

The obligation of Lattice to consummate the Merger is subject to the following additional conditions:
 

 
•  the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub, subject to certain materiality

standards as described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement —

 •  performance by Parent and Merger Sub in all material respects of their respective obligations under theMerger Agreement; and
 

 •  the receipt of an officer’s certificate certifying that the foregoing conditions have been satisfied.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
Lattice and Parent have agreed to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals
required or deemed necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Under the
HSR Act, the Merger may not be consummated until the expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period following the
parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the earlier termination of that waiting period. On
January 4, 2017, the Federal Trade Commission, which we refer to in this proxy as the “FTC”, granted early termination
of the waiting period.

Further, Lattice and Parent have submitted a joint voluntary notice under the Defense Production Act of 1950, as
amended, pursuant to their obligations under the Merger Agreement to seek a written notice from CFIUS clearing the
Merger (which written notice is described in greater detail in the definition of “CFIUS Approval” set forth in the Merger
Agreement included herein as Annex A and is referred to in this proxy statement as the “CFIUS Approval”).

The completion of the Merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Austrian
Competition Act (Wettbewerbsgesetz) and/or the Austrian Cartel Act (Kartellgesetz). On January 16, 2017, Parent
notified the Austrian Federal Competition Authority (Bundeswettbewerbsbehörde) of the proposed Merger. Unless
extended or earlier terminated, the applicable waiting period will expire on February 13, 2017.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors
Lattice’s Board of Directors, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Board”, after considering various factors
described under the caption “The Merger — Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,”
has unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger

and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Lattice and its
stockholders, and adopted and approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement. The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger
Agreement; “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and “FOR” the proposal
to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to Lattice’s named executive
officers in connection with the Merger.

Fairness Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Lattice retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, which we refer to in this proxy statement as “Morgan Stanley,” to act as its
financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger. On November 2, 2016, Morgan Stanley rendered to the
Board its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of such date and based upon and subject to the
various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of
the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be
received by the holders of Lattice shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial
point of view to the holders of Lattice shares of common stock. The full text of Morgan Stanley’s written opinion to the
Board, dated as of November 2, 2016, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan
Stanley in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. The summary of the opinion of Morgan
Stanley in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. We encourage you
to read Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the summary of Morgan Stanley’s opinion below (in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger — Fairness Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC”) carefully and in their entirety.

Morgan Stanley’s opinion was rendered for the benefit of the Board, in its capacity as such, and addressed
only the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration to be received by the holders of Lattice
shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of the date of the opinion. It does not address
any other aspect or implications of the Merger. The opinion was addressed to, and rendered for the benefit of,
the Board and was not intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation to any holder of
Lattice common shares as to how to vote at any stockholders’ meetings to be held in connection with the
Merger or take any other action with respect to the Merger.

Interests of Lattice’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved, the shares of common stock held by our directors and
executive officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of common stock held by all other
stockholders; however, when considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the
Merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the
Merger Agreement, (2) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and (3) recommending that the Merger
Agreement be adopted by stockholders, the Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they
existed at the time, among other matters. These interests generally include, among others, the rights to accelerated
vesting of equity awards and potential payments and benefits in connection with a qualifying termination of
employment on or following the closing date of the Merger, as described in more detail under the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger —

Interests of Lattice’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” and “Proposal 3 — Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on
Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.”

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who
properly demand appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under
Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that stockholders are entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any
elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on
the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court. Due to the complexity of the appraisal
process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel
with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must (1) deliver a written demand for appraisal to Lattice before the vote is taken
on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement, and (3) continue to hold your shares of common stock of record through the Effective
Time. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal
rights. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement,
and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement. If
you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal
rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the
making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger
— U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares of common
stock in the Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the difference, if
any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger (determined before the deduction of any
applicable withholding taxes) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in
the Merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger — U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for
cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger — U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger.” Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income
tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under
U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Legal Proceedings Regarding the Merger
Lattice has amended its bylaws to provide that, unless Lattice consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Delaware Court of Chancery will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding
brought on behalf of the Company, any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty, any action arising under the DGCL
or the Company’s corporate governance documents, or any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal
affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware. In the event that the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks subject matter
jurisdiction over any such action, the sole and exclusive forum for such action shall be another state or federal court
located within the State of Delaware, in each case unless such court has dismissed a prior action by the same plaintiff
asserting the same claims due to lack of personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party named as a defendant
therein.

On January 9, 2017, an alleged stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action captioned Parshall v. Lattice
Semiconductor Corp., Case No. 3:17-cv-00035, in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. The
defendants in the action are the Company, the members of the Board, CBC Partners, Parent and Merger Sub. The
complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder by failing to disclose all material facts concerning the Merger in the draft proxy
statement filed on December 28, 2016. The complaint seeks an order: preliminarily and permanently enjoining
consummation of the proposed transaction or, if the proposed transaction is consummated, an order rescinding it and
awarding rescissory damages; directing defendants to issue a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue
statements of material fact; declaring that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and Rule 14a-9; and awarding plaintiff the costs of the action, including reasonable attorneys’ and experts’
fees; and granting such other and further relief as the court may deem proper. Defendants believe that the claims are
meritless and intend to defend the action.

Alternative Acquisition Proposals
Under the Merger Agreement, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time, Lattice has agreed not
to, and to cause its affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers or other employees, or any investment
banker, accountant, attorney or other advisor, agent or representative retained by any of them, whom we collectively
refer to as “representatives”, not to, among other things: (1) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate
any Takeover Proposal (as defined under “The Merger Agreement — Alternative Acquisition Proposals”) or any inquiry,
proposal or request for information that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal; (2) participate in
discussions or negotiations with, furnish to any information to, or cooperate in any way with, any person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub) with respect to any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or request for information that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal; (3) agree to,
approve, endorse, recommend or consummate any Takeover Proposal or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle or similar document contemplating any Takeover Proposal; (4) take any action
to make the provisions of any state takeover statute or similar law, or any anti-takeover provision in the Lattice charter,
inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by any Takeover Proposal; (5) grant any waiver, amendment or release
under any standstill or similar agreement; (6) enter into any contract that would restrict Lattice’s ability to comply with
the foregoing obligations, which are more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement — Alternative Acquisition Proposals”; or (7) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Table of Contents

Notwithstanding these restrictions, under certain circumstances following our receipt of a bona fide, written and
unsolicited Takeover Proposal, and prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Lattice’s stockholders, Lattice
may provide confidential information to, and engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with, a third party
regarding a Takeover Proposal if the Board determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor and its
outside legal counsel that such proposal is a Superior Proposal (as defined under “The Merger Agreement —
Alternative Acquisition Proposals”) or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the Board of Director’s fiduciary duties under applicable law. For more information,
please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement — Alternative Acquisition Proposals.”

Lattice is not entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an agreement for a Takeover Proposal that the
Board has determined is a Superior Proposal unless Lattice complies with certain procedures in the Merger
Agreement, including (1) negotiating with Parent in good faith over a four business day period to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that the Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal and (2) in the event such re-negotiation results in Parent’s proposal being amended such that the
Takeover Proposal is no longer superior, and following such re-negotiation the Takeover Proposal is amended to once
again become a Superior Proposal, negotiating with Parent in good faith over a subsequent two business day period
following each subsequent amendment to the Takeover Proposal so that such Takeover Proposal, as amended,
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. The termination of the Merger Agreement by Lattice to accept a Superior
Proposal will result in the payment by Lattice of a $34,180,000 termination fee to Parent. For more information, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement — The Board of Directors’ Recommendation;
Adverse Recommendation Change.”

Termination of the Merger Agreement
The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the adoption
of the Merger Agreement by stockholders, in the following ways:
 

 •  by mutual written agreement of Lattice and Parent;
 

 •  by either Lattice or Parent if:
 

 

•  the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before August 1, 2017, which we refer to as the
“outside date”, provided that in case the last to be satisfied or waived (where permissible) of the closing
conditions (other than those conditions that are only capable of being satisfied at the closing) occurs
within five business days of August 1, 2017, then the outside date will be extended to no later than
12:00 p.m. Pacific time on August 8, 2017 to the extent required to allow the closing to occur as
described under the caption “The Merger Agreement — Closing and Effective Time”, and further
provided that the right to terminate the Merger Agreement in this manner is not available to any party if
the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the outside date is a result of a breach of the Merger
Agreement by such party;

 

 

•  any governmental entity having competent jurisdiction, other than a governmental entity in China, shall
have (1) enacted, issued, promulgated or enforced any law that makes consummation of the Merger
illegal or otherwise prohibited or (2) enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any final and
nonappealable order which has the effect of making the consummation of the Merger illegal or
otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger; or

 

 •  Lattice’s stockholders fail to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting or any adjournment orpostponement thereof;

satisfied at the closing, and other than conditions that have not been satisfied due to an action by a
governmental entity in China) and all of the conditions to Parent and Merger Sub’s obligations to

the Merger Agreement are not satisfied; or

tender or exchange offer relating to Lattice’s common stock shall have commenced and Lattice shall
not have publicly recommended against such tender or exchange offer within ten business days, (4) the
Board fails to publicly reconfirm its recommendation that Lattice stockholders adopt the Merger
Agreement within the ten business day period following the date on which Lattice receives written

In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to the termination rights above, the Merger Agreement
will be of no further force or effect without liability of any party to the other parties, as applicable, except certain
sections of the Merger Agreement will survive the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with their
respective terms, including terms relating to the escrow arrangement. Subject to the limits specified in the Merger
Agreement, termination of the Merger Agreement shall not relieve any party from any liability for fraud or willful breach,
except that in no event will Parent, Merger Sub, Canyon Bridge, CVC or any of their respective affiliates and
representatives have any liability for, or be required to pay, damages relating to or arising out of the Merger Agreement,
the Equity Commitment Letter, any financing related to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement (including for fraud or willful breach, including with respect to obtaining CFIUS Approval or
otherwise), for an aggregate amount in excess of any amount then held in the escrow account established by Parent
and Lattice at signing (which escrow account was funded at signing by Parent with an amount in cash equal to the
$58,750,000 reverse termination fee). In addition, in no event is Lattice entitled to payment of both the reverse
termination fee of $58,750,000 and specific performance. In addition, no termination of the Merger Agreement will
affect the rights or obligations of any party pursuant to the confidentiality agreement between CBC Partners and
Lattice, which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with their respective terms.

Termination Fees
Except in specified circumstances, whether or not the Merger is completed, Lattice, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, are each responsible for all of their respective costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Lattice will be required to pay to Parent a termination fee of $34,180,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under
specified circumstances, and Parent will be required to pay to Lattice a reverse termination fee of $58,750,000 if the
Merger Agreement is terminated under different specified circumstances. The reverse termination fee may be paid
directly by Parent or out of funds which were placed into an escrow account located in the United States and held by
Citibank, National Association. The escrow funds will be held and released by Citibank, National Association, as
escrow agent pursuant to that certain escrow agreement, dated November 3, 2016, among Lattice, Parent and
Citibank, National Association, as escrow agent.

For more information on these termination fees, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement — Termination Fees.”

Effect on Lattice if the Merger is Not Completed
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Lattice will remain an
independent public company, Lattice common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Exchange
Act”, and Lattice will continue to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to
in this proxy statement as the “SEC.” Under specified circumstances, Lattice will be required to pay Parent a
termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement; and under different specified circumstances, Parent will
be required to pay Lattice a reverse termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement. For more details
see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees.”

US Bancorp Tower, 111 SW 5th Ave., Portland, Oregon 97204.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote
You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of Lattice common stock at the close of business
on January 4, 2017, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Record Date.” You will have one vote at the
Special Meeting for each share of common stock that you owned at the close of business on the Record Date.

Purpose
At the Special Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to: (1) adopt the Merger Agreement; (2) adjourn
the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the
Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation
that will or may become payable to Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Quorum
As of the Record Date, there were 121,643,484 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting. The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat,
present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting.

Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock is required to adopt the
Merger Agreement. Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present,
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented
by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of
compensation that will or may become payable to Lattice’s executive officers in connection with the Merger requires
the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy
at the Special Meeting entitled to vote on the subject matter.

to Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Voting and Proxies
Any stockholder of record entitled to vote may submit a proxy by returning a signed proxy card by mail in the
accompanying prepaid reply envelope or granting a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, or may vote
in person by appearing at the Special Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of common stock in
“street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how
you wish to vote your shares of common stock using the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.
Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine
matters. The proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting are non-routine matters, and banks, brokers and other
nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important that you cast your
vote or instruct your bank, broker or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.

If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the
Special Meeting by (1) signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it prior to the Special Meeting,
(2) submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy,
(3) delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary, or (4) attending the Special Meeting and voting
in person by ballot.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting only if you obtain a
“legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Table of Contents

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your
shares in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may not vote your shares in
person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

 
Q: What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Lattice?
 

A: The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Lattice by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is
approved by stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or
waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Lattice, with Lattice continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result
of the Merger, Lattice will become a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Lattice common stock will no
longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from Nasdaq. In addition, Lattice common stock will be deregistered
under the Exchange Act, and Lattice will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

 
Q: What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
 

A: Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each share of
common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal rights under the
DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of Lattice common stock, you will receive $830.00 in cash in exchange for
your shares of common stock, less any applicable withholding taxes.

 
Q: How does the Per Share Merger Consideration compare to the unaffected market price of the common stock?
 

A: The relationship of the $8.30 Per Share Merger Consideration to the trading price of Lattice common stock constituted
a premium of approximately 30% to the closing price of Lattice’s common stock on November 2, 2016, the last trading
day prior to the date on which Lattice entered into the Merger Agreement and publicly announced the proposed
Merger.

 
Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer
to in this proxy statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly
as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided, or grant your proxy electronically over
the Internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you plan to seek
appraisal rights. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your
bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy
card.

 
Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?
 

A: No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send your
stock certificates to the payment agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of common
stock represented by your stock certificates. You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock
certificates for the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your
proxy card.

Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the
Special Meeting?

 

A: The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is
expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the
Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person
to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Lattice in writing of such special
arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to
the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special
Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you
to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically
over the Internet or by telephone.

 
Q: How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?
 

A: The Board, after considering the various factors described under the caption “The Merger — Recommendation of the
Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of
Lattice and its stockholders, and (2) adopted and approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

The Board recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment
of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt
the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding,
advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with
the Merger.

 
Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?
 

A: If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Lattice will remain an
independent public company, Lattice common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered
under the Exchange Act, and Lattice will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.

Under specified circumstances, Lattice will be required to pay Parent a termination fee upon the termination of the
Merger Agreement; and under different specified circumstances, Parent will be required to pay Lattice a reverse
termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement. For more details see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees.”

 
Q: What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
 

A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Lattice common stock is
required to adopt the Merger Agreement.

If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to: (1) submit a signed proxy
card; (2) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone; or (3) attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot
at the Special Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If
you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your
bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Q: What vote is required to approve any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the
Special Meeting and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become
payable to Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?

 

A: Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special
Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will
or may become payable to Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special
Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card, (2) grant a proxy over the Internet or by
telephone, or (3) attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any
effect on the adjournment proposal or the compensation proposal. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure
to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on the adjournment
proposal and the compensation proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
adjournment proposal and the compensation proposal.

 
Q: Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become

payable to Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
 

A: SEC rules require Lattice to seek a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become
payable by Lattice to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Q: What is the compensation that will or may become payable to Lattice’s named executive officers in

connection with the Merger for purposes of this advisory vote?
 

A: The compensation that will or may become payable by Lattice to its named executive officers in connection with the
Merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the Merger and payable to certain of Lattice’s named
executive officers. For further detail, see the section captioned “Proposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-
Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.”

 
Q: What will happen if stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by

Lattice to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger at the Special Meeting?
 

A: Approval of the compensation proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the
compensation proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Lattice or Parent. If the Merger Agreement is
adopted by the stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that will or may become payable by
Lattice to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger may be paid to Lattice’s named executive officers
even if stockholders fail to approve the compensation proposal.

 
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
 

A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company N.A., you
are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and
your proxy card have been sent directly to you by Lattice.

If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares
of common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy

statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those
shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other
nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the Special
Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the
Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

 
Q: How may I vote?
 

A: If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered in your name with
Computershare Trust Company N.A., our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:

 

 •  by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
 

 •  by accessing the Internet address on your proxy card;
 

 •  by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or
 

 •  by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of
common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically
over the Internet or by telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote
electronically over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges
for which you will be responsible.

Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of common
stock by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you
may still vote your shares of common stock in person by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously
voted by proxy. If you are present at the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your previous vote by proxy will
not be counted.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank,
broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee,
or, if such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the Internet or by
telephone. To vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow
the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or nominee.

 
Q: If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
 

A: No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is only permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to
be considered at the Special Meeting if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should
follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote of your shares. Without instructions,
your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted against adoption of
the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the adjournment proposal or the compensation proposal.

 
Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?
 

A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted
at the Special Meeting by:

 

 •  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submittedproxy;

 •  delivering a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary; or
 

 •  attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting only if you obtain
a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

 
Q: What is a proxy?
 

A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of common stock.
The written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy
statement.” The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a “proxy card.”
Darin G. Billerbeck, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Byron W. Milstead, our Corporate Vice President,
General Counsel and Secretary, with full power of substitution, are the proxy holders for the Special Meeting.

 
Q: If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
 

A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you indicate.
When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be
voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the
Special Meeting.

If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter,
the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
(2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to Lattice’s named executive
officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

A: Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone) each proxy card and
voting instruction card that you receive.

You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple
proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you
will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a
stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy
card.

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
 

A: If available, Lattice may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. Lattice intends
to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting.
All reports that Lattice files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. See the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”

 
Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the

Merger?
 

A: If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger — U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”), the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger

will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to
recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the Merger (determined before the deduction of any applicable
withholding taxes) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the
Merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger — U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for
cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the
U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any
consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing
jurisdiction. A more complete description of U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided under
the caption “The Merger — U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

 
Q: What will the holders of Company Stock Options receive in the Merger?
 

A: At the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option (after taking into account the measurement of any corporate
performance goals that are required to be measured under the terms thereof and any accelerated vesting that is
required to occur at or prior to the Effective Time) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any
required withholding tax) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares subject to such Vested
Company Option by (2) the amount by which $8.30 exceeds the per share exercise price of such Vested Company
Option, which cash amount will be paid as soon as administratively practicable, but not later than ten business days,
following the Effective Time.

At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any
required withholding tax) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares subject to such
Unvested Company Option by (2) the amount by which $8.30 exceeds the per share exercise price of such Unvested
Company Option, which cash amount will be payable in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such
Unvested Company Option as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the Unvested Company
Option holder’s continued service on each applicable vesting date.

All Company Stock Options which are not In-the-Money Company Options and any other Company Stock Options
that are not granted under any Company Stock Plan shall be canceled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
without the payment of any consideration.

For further detail on the treatment of Company Stock Options, see the section captioned “The Merger Agreement —
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.”

 
Q: What will the holders of Company RSUs receive in the Merger?
 

A: At the Effective Time, each Vested RSU (after taking into account any accelerated vesting that is required to occur at
or prior to the Effective Time under the terms thereof) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any
required withholding tax) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) $8.30 by (2) the number of outstanding
shares of Lattice common stock that are subject to such Vested RSU, which cash amount will become payable in
accordance with the delivery schedule applicable to such Vested RSU as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

At the Effective Time, each Unvested RSU (after taking into account any accelerated vesting that is required to occur
at or prior to the Effective Time under the terms thereof) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for
any required withholding tax) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) $8.30 by (2) the number of outstanding
shares of Lattice common stock that remain subject to such Unvested RSU, which cash amount will vest and become
payable in accordance with the vesting and delivery schedule applicable to such Unvested RSU as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the Unvested RSU holder’s continued service on each applicable
vesting date.

For further detail on the treatment of Company RSUs, see the section captioned “The Merger Agreement —
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.”

 
Q: What will happen to the Company ESPP in the Merger?
 

A: With respect to the Company ESPP, no new offering period will commence, no Lattice employee or other person will
be permitted to begin participating in the Company ESPP, and no current participants will be permitted to increase
elective deferrals in respect of the current offering period. The offering period in effect on November 3, 2016 will
terminate no later than five days prior to the Effective Time, and amounts credited to the accounts of participants will
be used to purchase shares in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and such shares will be canceled
and converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 
Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
 

A: We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as practicable and currently expect to complete the Merger
in early 2017. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is
subject to the closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, many of which are outside of our control.

 
Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
 

A: If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who
properly demand appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under
Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of common stock are entitled to have their shares
appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of
common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court.
Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant
section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement.

 
Q: Do any of Lattice’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of Lattice

stockholders generally?
 

A: Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from,
or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement,
(2) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and (3) recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted
by stockholders, the Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they

Certain statements made herein, including, for example, the expected date of closing of the Merger and the potential
benefits of the Merger, are “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Statements that include the words “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “project,”
“anticipate,” “will,” “may,” “would” and similar statements of a future or forward-looking nature may be used to identify
forward-looking statements. In addition, any statement that refers to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of
future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. These forward-
looking statements reflect the current analysis of the management of the Company of existing information as of the date of
these forward-looking statements and are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control,
and are not guarantees of future results or achievements. Consequently, no forward-looking statements may be
guaranteed and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by such forward-looking
statements will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects
on, the Company or its businesses or operations. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements
and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Due to known and unknown risks, our actual
results may differ materially from our expectations or projections.

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-
looking statements: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the delay or
termination of the Merger Agreement; the outcome or length of any legal proceedings that may be instituted related to the
Merger Agreement; the inability to complete the Merger due to the failure to timely or at all obtain stockholder approval for
the Merger or the failure to satisfy other conditions to completion of the Merger, including the receipt on a timely basis or at
all of any required regulatory clearances related to the Merger, including the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting period under the Austrian Competition Act (Wettbewerbsgesetz) and/or the Austrian Cartel Act (Kartellgesetz) and
the clearance of the Merger by CFIUS; the failure of Parent to obtain or provide on a timely basis or at all the necessary
financing as set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter delivered pursuant to the Merger Agreement; risks that the
proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of
the Merger; the effects of local and national economic, credit and capital market conditions on the economy in general; and
the other risks and uncertainties described herein, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in
our other reports and other public filings with the SEC, as described below. The foregoing review of important factors that
could cause actual events to differ from expectations should not be construed as exhaustive.

THE SPECIAL MEETING

The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board for use at the Special Meeting.

Date, Time and Place
We will hold the Special Meeting on February 28, 2017, at 8:00 a.m., Pacific time, at our principal executive offices, located
on the 8th floor of the US Bancorp Tower, 111 SW 5th Ave., Portland, Oregon 97204.

Purpose of the Special Meeting
At the Special Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to: (1) adopt the Merger Agreement; (2) adjourn the
Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or
may become payable to Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum
Only stockholders of record as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special
Meeting. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal executive offices,
located at 111 SW Fifth Ave., Ste 700, Portland, Oregon 97204, during regular business hours for a period of no less than
ten days before the Special Meeting and at the place of the Special Meeting during the meeting.

As of the Record Date, there were 121,643,484 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting.

The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in
person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present
at the Special Meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.

Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock on the Record Date is required
to adopt the Merger Agreement. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by Lattice stockholders is a condition to the closing of
the Merger.

Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting
and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may
become payable to Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and
entitled to vote on the subject matter.

If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. For stockholders who attend the meeting or are represented by proxy and
abstain from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” any proposal to
adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the

Special Meeting and “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may
become payable to Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. However, the failure of any
stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card, (2) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone, or (3) vote in
person by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal or the compensation
proposal.

Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will have no
effect on (1) the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting or (2) the proposal to approve, by non-binding,
advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with the
Merger. A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does
not vote on a proposal because the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks
discretionary power to vote the shares. Under applicable stock exchange rules, as each of the proposals to be voted on at
the Special Meeting is considered “non-routine,” brokers do not have discretion to vote on such proposals and as such,
broker non-votes will not be included in the calculation of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock
represented at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining a majority.

Shares Held by Lattice’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of January 23, 2017, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
3,182,946 shares of common stock, representing approximately 2.62% of the shares of common stock outstanding. Our
directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger
Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the non-
binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to Lattice’s named executive officers
in connection with the Merger.

Voting of Proxies
If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company N.A., you may cause
your shares to be voted by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid envelope, or you may
vote in person at the Special Meeting. Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone
by following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the
instructions on the proxy card, in order to grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone. Based on your
proxy cards or Internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will vote your shares according to your directions.

If you plan to attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the Special Meeting. If
your shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Special
Meeting in person. If you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any previously
submitted proxy.

Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received
in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder.
Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted: (1) “FOR” adoption of the Merger
Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the

proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to Lattice’s named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker
or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or attending
the Special Meeting and voting in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee. If such a service is
provided, you may vote over the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the
instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not return your bank’s, broker’s or
other nominee’s voting form, do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if
possible, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other
nominee, it will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but will not
have any effect on the adjournment proposal or the compensation proposal.

Revocability of Proxies
If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the
Special Meeting by:
 

 •  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submittedproxy;
 

 •  delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or
 

 •  attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you have submitted a proxy, your appearance at the Special Meeting, in the absence of voting in person or submitting an
additional proxy or revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting only if you obtain a
“legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Any adjournment, postponement or other delay of the Special Meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies, will allow stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the
Special Meeting as adjourned, postponed or delayed.

Board of Directors’ Recommendation
The Board, after considering various factors described under the caption “The Merger — Recommendation of the Board of
Directors and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (1) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Lattice and its stockholders
and (2) adopted and approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. The Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement;
(2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to Lattice’s named executive
officers in connection with the Merger.

Table of Contents

Solicitation of Proxies
The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by Lattice. Lattice has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated, a proxy
solicitation firm, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Proxy Solicitor”, to solicit proxies in connection with the
Special Meeting at a fee of approximately $17,500 plus expenses. We will also indemnify the Proxy Solicitor against losses
arising out of its provisions of these services on our behalf. In addition, we may reimburse banks, brokers and other
nominees representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to such beneficial
owners. Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers and employees, personally or by telephone, email, fax, over
the Internet or other means of communication. No additional compensation will be paid for such services.

Anticipated Date of Completion of the Merger
Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by stockholders of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement and CFIUS Approval, we anticipate that the Merger will be consummated in early 2017.

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who
properly demand appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under
Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of common stock are entitled to have their shares appraised
by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of common stock,
exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to
be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court, so long as they comply with the
procedures established by Section 262 of the DGCL. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who
wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of
appraisal rights.

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the Per Share
Merger Consideration.

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must (1) deliver a written demand for appraisal to Lattice before the vote is taken on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement, and (3) continue to hold your shares of common stock of record through the Effective Time. Your
failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The DGCL
requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section
of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your
shares of common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you
should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of
a demand for appraisal by such bank, brokerage firm or nominee. A recent amendment to Section 262 of the DGCL allows
the surviving corporation to make a cash payment prior to the entry of a judgment by the Delaware Court of Chancery to
holders of shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights so no interest will accrue on the prepaid amount. Interest
will still accrue on the difference, if any, between the paid amount and the fair value of the shares, as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, and on any interest accrued before the payment, unless it was included in the payment.

Other Matters
At this time, we know of no other matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting. If any other matters properly come before
the Special Meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted in accordance with the discretion of the appointed proxy
holders.

Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Stockholder Meeting to be Held on
February 28, 2017

The proxy statement is available on the website of our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company N.A., at

Householding of Special Meeting Materials
Unless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of this proxy statement to any household at
which two or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family. Each stockholder in
the household will continue to receive a separate proxy card. This process, known as “householding,” reduces the volume
of duplicate information received at your household and helps to reduce our expenses.

described below. Similarly, if you share an address with another stockholder and together both of you would like to receive
only a single set of our disclosure documents, follow these instructions.

If you are a stockholder of record, you may contact us by writing to Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, 111 SW Fifth Ave.,
Ste 700, Portland, Oregon 97204, Attention: Corporate Secretary or calling our Proxy Solicitor at the number provided
below. Eligible stockholders of record receiving multiple copies of this proxy statement can request householding by
contacting us in the same manner. If a bank, broker or other nominee holds your shares, please contact your bank, broker
or other nominee directly.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

We are asking you to adopt the Merger Agreement.

For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the Merger Agreement and
the Merger throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the sections captioned “The Merger”
beginning on page 34 of this proxy statement and “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 96 of this proxy statement.
A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. You are urged to read the Merger
Agreement carefully in its entirety.

Under applicable law, we cannot complete the Merger without the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Lattice common stock voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you abstain from voting, fail to cast
your vote, in person or by proxy, or fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will
have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Lattice common stock is required
to approve this proposal.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 2: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or
appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the
Special Meeting. If stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any
adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including proxies from
stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing
a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the Merger Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the
Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the
discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Lattice stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter is required to approve this proposal.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY, NON-BINDING VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
ARRANGEMENTS

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-
binding basis, the payment of certain compensation that will or may become payable to Lattice’s named executive officers
in connection with the Merger. For a summary of the terms and conditions of the payments described below, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger — Interests of Lattice’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger.”

The information set forth in the table below titled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Named Executive
Officers in Connection with the Merger,” is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which requires
disclosure of information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of the Company that is based on, or
otherwise relates to, the Merger. The amounts reported below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or
may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement, and do not reflect certain actions that may
occur before completion of the Merger (such as the exercise of outstanding Company Stock Options and the vesting and
settlement of Company RSUs after the assumed completion date of the Merger). As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to
be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below. In particular, for purposes
of calculating the amounts set forth in the table below, we have assumed that (1) the Merger was completed on January
23, 2017 (the latest practicable date prior to filing this proxy statement) and each named executive officer’s outstanding
equity awards, base salary and target bonus amounts are calculated as of such date, (2) the employment of each of the
named executive officers was terminated either by Lattice without cause or by the named executive officer for good reason
immediately thereafter, and (3) each named executive officer would receive approximately the amounts set forth in the
table below, based on a $8.30 per share price for each share of Lattice common stock (which is the Per Share Merger
Consideration).

Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to
Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger

 
Name(1)   Cash(2)    Equity(3)    

Perquisites/
Benefits(4)    Total  

Darin G. Billerbeck   $2,000,000    $3,913,470    $ 25,378    $5,938,848  
Max Downing   $ 412,500    $ 423,462    $ 25,378    $ 861,340  
Glen Hawk   $ 630,000    $1,221,784    $ 18,054    $1,869,838  
Byron W. Milstead   $ 524,700    $ 798,261    $ 18,054    $1,341,015  

 
(1) On April 1, 2016, Joseph G. Bedewi, the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer, resigned from the position of Chief Financial Officer and

terminated employment with the Company. Mr. Bedewi will not receive any compensation that will or may become payable in connection with the
Merger.

(2) The amount shown represents the double-trigger cash severance payable pursuant to the terms of each named executive officer’s employment
agreement with Lattice, consisting of a lump-sum cash payment equal to 2.0 (in the case of Mr. Billerbeck) or 1.0 (in the case of each named
executive officer other than Mr. Billerbeck) multiplied by the sum of each named executive officer’s annual base salary and his target annual bonus
amount (with no proration).

(3) The amount shown includes the value of single-trigger accelerated vesting of Company RSUs granted under Lattice’s 2013 Incentive Plan (as
amended) or Lattice’s 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended) that are held by each named executive officer as of January 23, 2017 and which will
be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each Company RSU upon consummation of the Merger. This amount is
computed as the product obtained by multiplying (a) $8.30 by (b) the number of shares subject to such Vested RSUs.

Table of Contents

In addition, the amount shown includes the value of performance-based In-the-Money Company Options held by the executive as of January 23,
2017 that will be converted into the right to receive the difference between Per Share Merger Consideration and the per share exercise price of each
performance-based Company Stock Option upon consummation of the Merger, assuming that the target level of performance is achieved, with the
resulting number of In-the-Money Company Options (as prorated based on the number of days that have elapsed from the date of grant through the
Effective Time) becoming Vested Company Options as of the Effective Time. This amount is computed as the product obtained by multiplying (1) the
total number of shares subject to each Vested Company Option by (2) the amount by which $8.30 exceeds the per share exercise price of such
Vested Company Option. Assuming that the maximum level of performance is achieved (instead of target) and prorated based on the number of
days that have elapsed from the date of grant through the Effective Time, the payout for the Performance-Based Company Options held by executive
officers would increase by $443,995 for Mr. Billerbeck, $0 for Mr. Downing, $41,353 for Mr. Hawk and $91,776 for Mr. Milstead.

The amount shown includes the value of single-trigger or double-trigger accelerated vesting of Unvested Company Options held by each named
executive officer as of January 23, 2017 pursuant to the terms of each named executive officer’s employment agreement with Lattice and Mr. Hawk’s
letter agreement, dated November 3, 2016, with Parent and Lattice. This amount is computed as the product obtained by multiplying (1) the total

We are asking stockholders to indicate their approval of the various compensation that will or may become payable to
Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the section captioned
“The Merger — Interests of Lattice’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Payments Upon Termination
Following Change-in-Control” and the accompanying footnotes. In general, the various plans and arrangements pursuant
to which these compensation payments may be made have previously formed part of Lattice’s overall compensation
program for our named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to stockholders as part of the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis and related sections of our annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were
adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board, which is composed solely of non-management
directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.

Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting: “RESOLVED, that the stockholders
of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become
payable to Lattice’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to
Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K above.

Stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and as an advisory vote, the
result will not be binding on Lattice, the Board or Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in
nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory
vote, if the Merger is consummated our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based
on or otherwise relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.

Table of Contents

Canyon Bridge, an affiliate of CBC Partners, is a recently established private equity buyout fund focused on technology
companies. Canyon Bridge has one limited partner, a wholly owned subsidiary of CVC, a large Chinese investment fund.
Canyon Bridge has entered into the Equity Commitment Letter with Parent, pursuant to which, subject to certain
conditions, Canyon Bridge has agreed to provide or cause to be provided the equity financing necessary for Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.

The proceeds from the equity financing will be available to fund the payments contemplated by the Merger Agreement
(pursuant to the terms and conditions as described further under the caption “The Merger — Financing of the Merger”).

Effect of the Merger
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub will merge
with and into Lattice, and Lattice will continue as the Surviving Corporation and as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent. As a result of the Merger, Lattice will become a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Lattice common
stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from Nasdaq. In addition, Lattice common stock will be
deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Lattice will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If the Merger is
completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Effect on Lattice if the Merger is Not Completed
If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, Lattice will remain an independent
public company, Lattice common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange
Act and Lattice will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we expect that
management will operate the business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that stockholders
will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to
the highly competitive industry in which Lattice operates and risks related to adverse economic or industry conditions.

Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be
completed, the price of Lattice common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever,
the price of Lattice common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on
the future value of your shares of common stock. If the Merger is not completed, the Board will continue to evaluate and
review Lattice’s business operations, strategic direction and capitalization, among other things, and will make such
changes as are deemed appropriate. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not
completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Board will be
offered or that Lattice’s business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.

In addition, Lattice will be required to pay to Parent a termination fee of $34,180,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated
under specified circumstances. For more information please see the section captioned “The Merger Agreement —
Termination Fees.”

Merger Consideration
At the Effective Time, each share of Lattice’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, that is outstanding immediately
prior to such time (other than (1) shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company (including any shares held in the
treasury of the Company) or by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or
(2) shares held by stockholders of the Company who not have voted in favor of the Merger and who are entitled to demand
and properly demand their statutory rights of appraisal in accordance with the DGCL) will be canceled and extinguished
and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $8.30 per share (without interest and
subject to deduction for any required withholding tax).

After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but you will no longer
have any rights as a stockholder (except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights will have the right to
receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated
by Delaware law, as described below under the caption “The Merger — Appraisal Rights”).

Background of the Merger
The Board and senior management team regularly review Lattice’s performance, future growth prospects and overall
strategic direction, and consider potential opportunities to strengthen Lattice’s businesses and enhance stockholder value.
These reviews have included consideration of a variety of strategic alternatives, including continuing to pursue Lattice’s
current strategy and investments, potential changes to Lattice’s current strategy and investments, and potential strategic or
financing transactions with third parties. The Board and senior management team evaluate these strategic alternatives
based upon what they believe will create stockholder value, further Lattice’s strategic objectives, and enhance Lattice’s
ability to serve customers, and based upon consideration of the potential benefits and risks of each of these alternatives in
light of, among other things, the business environment, recent semiconductor industry consolidation trends and Lattice’s
performance and competitive position.

On June 15, 2015, representatives of a financial advisor to Party A, a China-based financial sponsor, contacted Abid
Ahmad, a senior advisor to Lattice in connection with strategic transactions, and informed him that Party A was interested
in meeting with Lattice to discuss a potential strategic transaction involving Lattice and Party A. The representatives of
Party A’s financial advisor indicated that they believed Party A was a highly motivated buyer and would be prepared to
offer a price that represented a very meaningful premium to Lattice’s then-current valuation. Mr. Ahmad promptly notified
Darin G. Billerbeck, Lattice’s Chief Executive Officer.

On June 17, 2015, Mr. Billerbeck advised John Bourgoin, Lattice’s Chairman of the Board of Directors, of Party A’s interest,
and Mr. Bourgoin agreed that Mr. Billerbeck should have an introductory meeting with Party A. Later that day, Lattice sent
a proposed form of nondisclosure agreement to Party A, and Mr. Ahmad subsequently scheduled a meeting with the
representatives of Party A for July 15, 2015.

On June 22, 2015, Robin Abrams, a member of Lattice’s Board, was contacted by a business acquaintance, who
introduced her to a representative of Party B, another China-based financial sponsor.

On July 6, 2015, Ms. Abrams met with a representative of Party B. During the meeting, the representative of Party B
indicated that Party B was very interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with Lattice, and asked to be introduced to Mr.
Bourgoin. Ms. Abrams contacted Mr. Bourgoin and they scheduled a meeting with representatives of Party B for August
11, 2015.

On July 14, 2015, Lattice and Party A entered into a nondisclosure agreement. Among other things, the nondisclosure
agreement imposed a nine-month standstill on Party A’s ability to acquire any Lattice common stock. However, the
standstill automatically terminated upon (1) the acquisition by any person or

group of, or Lattice’s entry into an agreement for any person or group to acquire, 50% or more of Lattice’s common shares,
or (2) the commencement by a third party of a tender or exchange offer for 50% or more of Lattice’s common shares that
the Lattice Board does not recommend that Lattice stockholders reject. We refer to this form of nondisclosure agreement
as “Lattice’s Standard Form NDA.”

On July 15 and 16, 2015, Mr. Billerbeck and Mr. Ahmad had meetings with representatives of Party A and Party A’s
financial advisor in Beijing, China to discuss Lattice’s business and a possible strategic transaction involving Lattice and
Party A. The representatives of Party A provided Mr. Billerbeck and Mr. Ahmad with additional information regarding Party
A and why they believed that a transaction with Lattice would be a good strategic fit for Party A, and indicated that Party A
was highly motivated and had been willing to pay a relatively high premium in another recent transaction. Mr. Billerbeck
provided the representatives of Party A with an overview of Lattice’s current business and future plans. Mr. Billerbeck later
reported to Mr. Bourgoin on the discussions with Party A.

On each of July 21 and July 28, 2015, a representative of Party A’s financial advisor contacted Mr. Ahmad to reiterate
Party A’s interest in continuing to discuss a potential strategic transaction with Lattice, but noted that given the recent
declines in Lattice’s stock price (the closing trading price for Lattice common shares was $4.92 on July 27, 2015, while it
was $6.39 on June 12, 2015, the last trading day prior to the date Party A’s financial advisor first contacted Lattice), the
timing might not be appropriate to make an offer.

On August 6, 2015, the Board held a meeting and discussed Lattice’s financial performance and prospects, including
recent revenue shortfalls as compared to internal forecasts, and potential cost saving measures. Mr. Billerbeck reported on
the discussions with Party A and the Board discussed Party A and the potential benefits of exploring a strategic transaction
with Party A. The Board instructed Mr. Billerbeck to set up a meeting with representatives of Party A to discuss further
Party A’s interest in a potential strategic transaction with Lattice, which was later set for September 1, 2015.

On August 11, 2015, Ms. Abrams and Mr. Bourgoin met with the representative of Party B, and discussed Party B’s
interest in pursuing a potential strategic transaction with Lattice.

On August 23, 2015, representatives of Party B contacted Mr. Bourgoin to request a follow-up meeting, and the next day,
Mr. Bourgoin discussed the meeting with Party B with the other members of the Board, and the Board determined that
Lattice management should be instructed to meet with Party B and explore its interest in pursuing a potential strategic
transaction with Lattice.

On August 31, 2015, the Board held a meeting, with members of Lattice’s senior management in attendance. Mr. Bourgoin
reported on the discussions with Party B, and the Board instructed Mr. Billerbeck to set up a meeting with representatives
of Party B to discuss further Party B’s interest in a potential strategic transaction with Lattice.

During September and October 2015, representatives of Lattice senior management met separately on several occasions
with representatives of Party A and Party B, including in-person meetings in Beijing, China, regarding a potential strategic
transaction involving Lattice.

In furtherance of discussions with Party B, on October 23, 2015, Lattice and Party B entered into Lattice’s Standard Form
NDA.

On November 4, 2015, Mr. Ahmad met with representatives of Party A and discussed Lattice’s business, growth strategies
and forecasts for 2015 and 2016. Party A’s representatives indicated that Party A was now preparing to submit a non-
binding indication of interest proposing a strategic transaction involving Lattice and Party A, and that Party A was seeking
investors who would be willing to provide the necessary financing.

On November 5, 2015, the Board held a meeting. At this meeting, Mr. Billerbeck led a discussion of Lattice’s financial
performance and prospects, including expectations for the fourth quarter of 2015 and projections for 2016 and subsequent
years, product road map and key customer opportunities, potential cost cutting measures, and Lattice’s strategic position
and strategic options, including the possibility of a strategic transaction. Also at this meeting, a prospective financial
advisor made a presentation to the Board regarding the strategic landscape of the semiconductor industry and potential
interest from buyers in China in acquiring semiconductor companies, and Mr. Billerbeck updated the Board on the
discussions with Party A and Party B. Mr. Billerbeck discussed the possibility that a transaction with a China-based buyer
may require approval from CFIUS and indicated that Lattice would seek a meaningful reverse termination fee payable in
the event CFIUS approval was not obtained. The Board authorized Mr. Billerbeck to continue discussions with Party A and
Party B.

On November 18, 2015, Mr. Ahmad met with representatives of Party B, and discussed Lattice’s business, growth
strategies and views as to Lattice’s business prospects for 2015 and 2016. Party B indicated that they were seeking to put
together a financing consortium and might seek to partner with another investor to submit a proposal for a potential
strategic transaction involving Lattice.

On November 27, 2015, representatives of Party A contacted Mr. Ahmad to convey that Party A was continuing to seek to
put together a financing consortium and that Party A might seek to partner with one or more investors to submit a proposal
for a potential strategic transaction involving Lattice.

On December 2, 2015, Mr. Ahmad met with representatives of Party B to discuss Party B’s plans to submit a proposal for a
potential strategic transaction involving Lattice. Party B indicated that it planned to partner with Party A to submit a
proposal for a potential strategic transaction involving Lattice. While Lattice was aware that Party A and Party B had a
number of significant investors in common, Lattice had not previously discussed the possibility of a joint bid with either
Party A or Party B.

On December 3, 2015, the Board held a meeting, at which Mr. Billerbeck provided the Board with an update as to the
status of the discussions with Party A and Party B, including the fact that Party A and Party B were now contemplating a
joint bid. The Board discussed the financial resources and reputation of Party A and Party B, and encouraged
management to continue discussion to see what kind of premium Party A and Party B would be prepared to offer.

On December 4, 2015, a representative of Party B contacted Mr. Ahmad to inform him that Party A and Party B were
finalizing a non-binding indication of interest proposing a strategic transaction involving Lattice, Party A and Party B.

Subsequently, on each of December 5 and December 8, 2015, representatives of Party A contacted Mr. Ahmad to confirm
that Party A intended to submit a proposal jointly with Party B, and that the proposal would be coming soon.

On December 8, 2015, Lattice engaged Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, which we refer to in this proxy
statement as “Skadden”, to serve as Lattice’s legal advisor in connection with its discussions with respect to a potential
strategic transaction with Party A and Party B. Lattice later also engaged Skadden in connection with its discussions with
the other parties that approached or were approached by Lattice in the period leading up to when Lattice entered into the
Merger Agreement.

On December 11, 2015, Party A and Party B jointly submitted a non-binding indication of interest proposing to purchase all
of Lattice’s outstanding common shares for a price between $8.00 and $8.50 per share in cash. The proposal was subject
to customary due diligence review and Lattice’s agreement to negotiate with Party A and Party B on an exclusive basis
until February 10, 2016 (which exclusivity period would be automatically extended by one week in the event the parties
were still in active negotiations as of February 10, 2016). The Board was promptly notified of the non-binding

indication of interest. Based on the closing trading price of $6.26 for Lattice common shares on the previous trading day
(December 10, 2015), the proposal’s range of $8.00 to $8.50 per share implied a premium of between 28% and 36%. The
proposal was set to expire at 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on December 16, 2015. Party A and Party B also provided a list of
requested diligence materials.

On December 14, 2015 the Board held a meeting at which representatives of Skadden advised the Board of their fiduciary
duties in connection with the offer by Party A and Party B, and the Board discussed Lattice’s financial performance,
prospects, and strategy. The Board also discussed engaging a financial advisor to help the Board evaluate whether the
offer by Party A and Party B merited consideration at this time.

On December 17, 2015, Mr. Ahmad communicated to representatives of Party A, Party B and Party A’s financial advisor
that Lattice’s Board was still considering the proposal from Party A and Party B. The parties also discussed the proposed
scope of diligence that Party A and Party B were seeking to conduct.

On December 21, 2015, the Board held a meeting, with members of Lattice senior management, representatives of
Skadden, and representatives of certain potential financial advisors in attendance. At this meeting, the Board approved the
creation of a Strategic Alternatives Committee, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “SAC”, which was tasked
with meeting regularly, including between regularly scheduled meetings of the Board, and evaluating strategic options for
Lattice to maximize stockholder value, including evaluating the proposal from Party A and Party B and any other proposals
that other parties may submit with respect to potential strategic transactions with Lattice. The SAC consisted of Robert
Herb (chairman), Mark Jensen and Jeff Richardson. Also at this meeting, the Board interviewed a number of potential
financial advisors and selected Morgan Stanley to serve as its financial advisor, after considering Morgan Stanley’s
presentation of its qualifications, related experience, reputation and prior representations, including the existence of any
potential or actual conflicts of interest. The Board directed members of Lattice senior management to continue discussions
with Party A and Party B to see if they could be convinced to increase their offer.

On December 23, 2015, Lattice entered into an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley to serve as its financial advisor.

Also on December 23, 2015, members of Lattice senior management, and representatives of Morgan Stanley met with
representatives of Party A, Party B and Party A’s financial advisor to discuss Lattice’s business and strategy for growth,
and informed them that the Board was still considering the proposal from Party A and Party B.

On December 28, 2015, representatives of Morgan Stanley and representatives of Party A’s financial advisor discussed
valuation issues and Party A’s and Party B’s offer price of $8.00 to $8.50 per share.

On December 30, 2015, the Board held a meeting, with members of Lattice senior management and representatives of
Morgan Stanley in attendance. At this meeting, the Board discussed Lattice’s financial performance and prospects,
including the potential upside from a recent design win with a key customer, and strategic alternatives available to Lattice
to maximize stockholder value, including remaining a stand-alone company, potential third party interest in investing in or
acquiring a Lattice business unit, further cost reductions, a share buyback, the status of negotiations with Party A and
Party B, and how to respond to the proposal from Party A and Party B. Also, the representatives of Morgan Stanley
discussed their preliminary views on valuation with the Board. The Board determined that Lattice should decline to grant
Party A and Party B exclusivity, but should continue to engage with Party A and Party B and allow them to conduct due
diligence to determine if a higher price was attainable. The Board also discussed with representatives of Morgan Stanley
other potentially interested parties, including Party C and Party D, each of which is a U.S.-based strategic entity.

Also on December 30, 2015, representatives of Morgan Stanley and representatives of Party B discussed the non-binding
indication of interest by Party A and Party B and the Board’s concerns with respect to exclusivity and valuation.

On January 4, 2016, the SAC held a meeting, with Mr. Billerbeck, other members of Lattice senior management and
representatives of Skadden and Morgan Stanley in attendance. At this meeting, the SAC discussed the status of
negotiations with Party A and Party B, and Party A’s and Party B’s requests for additional information regarding Lattice. In
addition, the SAC met in executive session (without Mr. Billerbeck in attendance) with representatives of Skadden to
further discuss the progress of negotiations with Party A and Party B.

On January 8, 2016, the SAC held a meeting, with Mr. Billerbeck, other members of Lattice senior management and
representatives of Skadden and Morgan Stanley in attendance, and discussed the status of the negotiations with Party A
and Party B. The SAC also met in executive session, also attended by representatives of Skadden, and discussed the
negotiations with Party A and Party B.

Also on January 8, 2016, a member of Lattice senior management was introduced to a representative of the management
of Party E, a China-based strategic entity. The member of Lattice senior management in turn introduced the Party E
representative to Mr. Ahmad, and the parties agreed to have an initial discussion regarding a potential strategic transaction
or other business relationship on January 20, 2016.

On January 11, 2016, Mr. Billerbeck, Mr. Ahmad, and representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Party
A, Party B and Party A’s financial advisor. The Lattice representatives urged Party A and Party B to increase their offer
based on the Board’s expectations with respect to valuation expressed in response to the prior offer from Party A and
Party B, and reiterated that the Board was not willing to grant exclusivity at that time. The Lattice representatives also
indicated that if an acceptable price could be negotiated, Lattice would expect a significant termination fee to be payable
by Party A and Party B in the event the transaction was not completed, including if the transaction was not completed due
to a failure to obtain CFIUS approval. The parties also discussed expectations with respect to timing of the transaction.

On January 12, 2016, the SAC held a meeting, also attended by Mr. Billerbeck, Mr. Ahmad and representatives of
Skadden and Morgan Stanley. At this meeting, Mr. Billerbeck reported to the SAC on the results of the negotiations with
Party A and Party B, including that he expected Party A and Party B would shortly be making a revised offer at a higher
valuation. The SAC also discussed other parties that may be interested in pursuing a potential strategic transaction with
Lattice and authorized representatives of Morgan Stanley to contact Party C and Party D to explore with each of them a
potential strategic transaction with Lattice. The SAC also discussed the inquiry from Party E, and authorized management
to meet with Party E and explore the nature of its interest. In addition, the SAC met in executive session to further discuss
the process of negotiations with Party A and Party B, including a discussion of the timeline, risks (including with respect to
deal certainty and the regulatory approval process), issues around confidentiality and the diligence process, and the
identification of additional strategic and financial parties that may be interested in a strategic transaction with Lattice.

On January 13, 2016, Lattice received a revised non-binding indication of interest from Party A and Party B, which now
contemplated a purchase price of $9.00 per share. In addition, the revised proposal no longer called for exclusivity. The
Board was promptly notified of the revised proposal. Based on the closing trading price of $5.135 for Lattice common
shares on the previous trading day (January 12, 2016), the revised proposal implied a premium of 75%.

Also on January 13, 2016, representatives of Morgan Stanley separately contacted representatives of each of Party C and
Party D to inquire as to whether such parties would be interested in pursuing a potential strategic transaction involving
Lattice.

On January 14, 2016, the Board held a meeting, with members of Lattice senior management and representatives of
Skadden and Morgan Stanley also in attendance, and discussed the status of negotiations with Party A and Party B, as
well as the meeting scheduled with Party E. At this meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley provided an update on its
preliminary analysis on valuation. The Board and representatives of Morgan Stanley also discussed other parties that may
be interested in pursuing a potential strategic transaction with Lattice. The Board instructed Morgan Stanley to reach out at
this time to Party F, a Europe-based strategic entity, and Party G, a U.S.-based strategic entity, and to continue to engage
with Party C and Party D, to determine if any of these parties would be interested in a strategic transaction involving
Lattice. On the same date, Lattice provided access to the diligence materials gathered in the online data room to the
representatives of Party A and Party B.

On January 15, 2016, a representative of Morgan Stanley contacted representatives of Party F to inquire as to whether
Party F would be interested in pursuing a potential transaction with Lattice.

On January 16, 2016, representatives of Party A’s financial advisor contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to
discuss the revised non-binding indication of interest with Party A and Party B and a projected timeline for a transaction,
and to introduce Party A’s and Party B’s legal advisors. Morgan Stanley communicated that the Board had indicated the
proposed price would be acceptable, subject to agreement on the amount of the reverse termination fee that would be
payable in the event the transaction were not completed due to failure to obtain CFIUS approval, and the other terms of a
definitive agreement, as well as Party A and Party B’s ability to demonstrate that financing was available.

On January 18, 2016, members of Lattice senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley met with
representatives of Party A, Party B and Party A’s financial advisor in San Jose, California to discuss the diligence
information requested by Party A and Party B.

On January 19, 2016, Lattice and Party C entered into Lattice’s Standard Form NDA, except that in this case the

whether Party G would be interested in pursuing a potential strategic transaction involving Lattice.

On January 20, 2016, Mr. Billerbeck and other members of Lattice senior management met with representatives of Party E
and discussed Lattice’s business and whether Party E was interested in pursuing a potential strategic transaction with
Lattice. Party E indicated that while it may have some interest in a joint venture or other commercial relationship, it was not
sure whether a strategic transaction involving Lattice and Party E would be of interest to Party E at this time, but that it
would consider that possibility.

Later that day, Mr. Billerbeck and other members of Lattice senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley
met with representatives of Party A, Party B and Party A’s financial advisor for further due diligence. At this meeting,
representatives of Party A and Party B indicated that they were no longer prepared to offer $9.00 per share in connection
with the proposed transaction, and that the price they would be prepared to offer was much closer to $8.00. The
representatives of Party A and Party B also stated that they would need more time to secure the necessary financing for
the proposed transaction and that they were not willing to pay a significant reverse termination fee in connection with a
failure to obtain approval from CFIUS with respect to any potential transaction.

On January 21, 2016, a representative of Party A’s financial advisor contacted representatives of Morgan Stanley to
convey that Party A and Party B did not expect to be able to meet Lattice’s price expectations, and accordingly Party A and
Party B would suspend their discussions regarding a potential transaction with Lattice.

respect to a strategic transaction with Lattice at this time. The SAC was informed that Party G had declined to pursue a
transaction with Lattice and that Party F had yet to definitively respond to Lattice’s outreach. The SAC was also informed
of Party A’s and Party B’s view that their price would be closer to $8.00 per share and their rejection of a significant reverse
termination fee payable in connection with a failure to obtain CFIUS approval. The SAC discussed the fact that Party A and
Party B had also not been able to demonstrate that financing was available. Mr. Billerbeck and representatives of Morgan

Party A and Party B to the online data room. In addition, the SAC met in executive session with representatives of
Skadden in order to further discuss the exploration of other strategic alternatives, including potential divestitures or further

Lattice for $9.00 per share in cash, contingent upon Party H’s ability to find financing sources to help finance the proposed
transaction and satisfactory completion of customary due diligence. The Board was promptly notified of the non-binding
indication of interest. Based on the closing trading price of $4.72 for Lattice common shares on the previous trading day
(February 4, 2016), the proposal implied a premium of 91%.

On February 6, 2016, the SAC held a meeting, with Mr. Billerbeck, other members of Lattice senior management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley in attendance, and discussed Party H’s non-binding indication of interest, including a
discussion of timeline, required regulatory approvals (including the fact that CFIUS approval would be required in
connection with a transaction with Party H), deal certainty and whether Party H would be able to raise enough additional
equity and debt financing to pursue a transaction with a company of Lattice’s size. After discussing Lattice’s stand-alone
plan and strategic alternatives, the Board instructed Mr. Billerbeck and representatives of Morgan Stanley to pursue further
discussions with each of Party D and Party H regarding a potential strategic transaction.

to purchase all of the outstanding stock of Lattice for $9.00 per share in cash. The revised proposal now contemplated a
three week deadline for demonstrating progress towards obtaining committed financing and the completion of diligence.
The Board was promptly notified of the revised non-binding indication of interest. Based on the closing trading price of
$4.32 for Lattice common shares on the previous trading day (February 11, 2016), the proposal implied a premium of

and a number of proposed lenders to Party H over the following weeks.

a transaction with Lattice and that a potential transaction with Lattice was not likely to be a good strategic fit for Party I.

On February 29, 2016, a representative of Party D informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that Party D did not intend
to proceed with discussions with Lattice.

advisor and that it was in the process of retaining a new financial advisor.

management planned to remain employed with Lattice post-transaction. Mr. Billerbeck stated that he understood Party J’s

On July 7, 2016, Party J and its affiliates submitted a non-binding indication of interest, proposing to acquire all the
outstanding shares of Lattice for $8.00 per share in cash, which non-binding indication of interest contemplated that Lattice
and Party J would jointly approach CFIUS as part of the diligence process to better assess any potential regulatory risk.
The non-binding indication of interest also stated that Party J and its affiliates had the financial resources to finance the
transaction with equity without any need for third party financing. The Board was promptly notified of the non-binding
indication of interest. Based on the closing trading price of $5.32 for Lattice common shares on the previous trading day
(July 6, 2016), the proposal implied a premium of 50%.

On July 8, 2016, the SAC held a meeting, with Mr. Bourgoin, Mr. Billerbeck, other members of Lattice senior management
and representatives of Skadden and Morgan Stanley in attendance, and discussed the offer from Party J. Representatives
of Morgan Stanley provided Morgan Stanley’s updated analysis on valuation, and the SAC discussed the absence of a
termination fee payable if CFIUS approval was not obtained and the risk that CFIUS approval would not be obtained, the
size of the proposed termination fee and reverse termination fee, and the fact that Party J had equity funding available to
pay the entire purchase price. The SAC instructed Lattice management to permit Party J to conduct limited diligence and
to negotiate with Party J to determine if Party J would offer a higher price.

On July 14, 2016, Lattice provided Party J and its affiliates and advisors with limited access to the online data room.

On each of July 19 and 20, 2016, Mr. Billerbeck, other members of Lattice senior management and representatives of
Skadden and Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Party J and Jones Day, legal advisor to Party J, at which

Party J and CFIUS in order to better assess the prospects for obtaining CFIUS approval.

On July 26, 2016, Mr. Billerbeck, other members of Lattice senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley had
a meeting with Mr. Chow and representatives of Lazard. The members of Lattice senior management provided additional

Lattice management pushing for a higher price.

On July 28, 2016, Party J and its affiliates submitted a revised non-binding indication of interest, indicating that Party J and
its affiliates were interested in pursuing an all-cash transaction to acquire all the outstanding shares of Lattice for a price
between $8.75 and $9.00 per share, and proposing that Lattice and Party J enter into an agreement providing for
exclusivity until September 15, 2016 to incentivize Party J and its affiliates to dedicate the necessary resources to
complete a transaction within a short timeframe. The Board was promptly notified of the non-binding indication of interest.
Based on the closing trading price of $6.14 for Lattice common shares on the previous trading day (July 28, 2016), the
proposal’s range of $8.75 to $9.00 per share implied a premium of between 43% and 47%. Over the following weeks,
Lattice provided updated and further diligence material in the online data room in response to requests from Party J.

On August 1, 2016, the SAC held a meeting, with Mr. Bourgoin, Mr. Billerbeck, other members of Lattice senior
management and representatives of Skadden and Morgan Stanley in attendance, and reviewed and discussed Party J’s
and its affiliates’ revised non-binding indication of interest and proposed exclusivity agreement. Following that discussion,
the SAC determined to present the revised proposal to the Board at its next meeting later in the week, directed Lattice
management to continue to pursue an increase in price, and authorized Lattice management to make available further due
diligence materials to Party J to permit it to refine its view of price.

Also on August 1, 2016 and again on August 5, 2016, Mr. Ahmad, Mr. Chow and representatives of Lattice’s and Party J’s
legal advisors discussed the CFIUS approval process, including further discussion of the possibility of jointly engaging in
discussions with representatives of CFIUS with respect to a potential transaction in order to better understand CFIUS’
position with respect to a potential transaction so as to, from Lattice’s perspective, mitigate the absence of any reverse
termination fee being payable if CFIUS approval was not obtained.

On August 5, 2016, the Board held a meeting. Members of Lattice senior management and representatives of Skadden
and Morgan Stanley also participated in this meeting. At this meeting, the Board discussed Lattice’s stand-alone business,
including Lattice’s updated internal management forecasts, and the risks associated with achieving management’s
forecasts. These forecasts were the “Upside Case” that was subsequently provided to Morgan Stanley (for purposes of its
valuation analysis), and a subset of which was also provided to Canyon Bridge, as described under “The Merger – Certain
Prospective Financial Data.” Morgan Stanley discussed its analysis on valuation and outreach efforts to date, and Skadden
discussed the negotiations to date with respect to key issues in the transaction, including the risks related to obtaining
CFIUS approval. Following discussion, the Board resolved to enter into an exclusivity arrangement with Party J to pursue
active negotiations.

On August 8, 2016, Lattice and Party J entered into an exclusivity agreement pursuant to which Lattice agreed not to
initiate or facilitate discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction with any third party through August 21, 2016,
such exclusivity date to be automatically extended to September 21, 2016 should, on or prior to 11:59 p.m. on August 21,
2016, Party J confirm its continued willingness to negotiate a transaction with Lattice that involved a per share price of at
least $8.75 to $9.00 per share of Lattice’s common stock.

On August 12, 2016, the members of the Board other than Mr. Billerbeck, whom we refer to collectively in this proxy
statement as the “Non-Management Lattice Directors”, held a meeting. Representatives of Skadden and Morgan Stanley
also participated in this meeting. At this meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed their current view on
valuation, and the Board discussed the proposed terms of the exclusivity agreement, the status of negotiations with
respect to key issues related to a transaction with Party J and its affiliates (including the appropriate size of the termination
fee and reverse termination fee and the establishment of an escrow at signing in support of the reverse termination fee),
and the proposed timeline for further negotiations, as well as the status of discussions with respect to a potential
transaction involving one of Lattice’s business units. The Non-Management Lattice Directors noted that Party J was
required to confirm its preliminary valuation range for Lattice in order to maintain exclusivity by August 21, 2016.

Also on August 12, 2016, Mr. Billerbeck, Mr. Ahmad, Mr. Chow and representatives of Morgan Stanley and Lazard
discussed Lattice’s business and managements forecasts for 2017 and 2018, including the assumptions and risks in
connection with the updated Lattice management forecasts for 2017 and 2018, which had been furnished to Party J the
day prior to the meeting. For further information regarding these management forecasts, please see the discussion of the
“Upside Case” under “The Merger – Certain Prospective Financial Data.”

On August 17, 2016, Lattice notified Party J that it received an inbound, unsolicited expression of interest to engage in an
acquisition transaction from a representative of Party E, but that it had declined to meet with Party E pursuant to Lattice’s
obligations under the exclusivity agreement with Party J.

Also on August 17, 2016, the SAC held a meeting, with Mr. Billerbeck, other members of Lattice senior management and
representatives of Skadden and Morgan Stanley in attendance, and discussed the status of the diligence process and
negotiations with Party J. The SAC was also informed of Party E’s recent expression of interest in engaging in a potential
transaction with Lattice.

On August 21, 2016, Party J submitted to Lattice a revised non-binding indication of interest which provided for a purchase
price of $8.30 in cash per share of Lattice common stock and was contingent on an extension to the exclusivity period to
September 12, 2016 (which exclusivity period would be automatically extended to September 30, 2016 should Lattice
determine that Party J was negotiating in good faith and making satisfactory progress towards a mutually agreed upon
transaction). The Board was promptly notified of the non-binding indication of interest. Based on the closing trading price of
$6.10 for Lattice common shares on the previous trading day (August 19, 2016), the revised proposal implied a premium of
36%.

On August 22, 2016, representatives of Lattice, Party J and Morgan Stanley discussed Party J’s revised proposal. During
such discussion, Mr. Chow stated that, after discussions with Party J, he was considering leaving Party J to form a new

Also on August 22, 2016, the SAC held a meeting to review Party J’s revised proposal, with Mr. Bourgoin, Mr. Billerbeck
and representatives of Skadden and Morgan Stanley also in attendance. Representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed
certain financial analyses, and the SAC discussed Party J’s questions with respect to the updated management projections
for 2017 and 2018 and the prospects of Lattice in case Lattice did or did not obtain a certain design win from a key
customer. Based upon uncertainty regarding the proposed new fund and its ability to finance a transaction, and concern
that the new lower price could be matched by other bidders, the SAC determined not to extend exclusivity. As Party J’s
exclusivity had lapsed when it failed to reaffirm its prior valuation by August 21, 2016, the SAC discussed potential
outreach to other bidders.

On August 23, 2016, representatives of Party E and a financial advisor informed Mr. Billerbeck that Party E wanted to
continue discussions with Lattice regarding a potential transaction. Mr. Billerbeck encouraged Party E to reach out to
Morgan Stanley, and inquired whether Party E was serious in its interest and had formally engaged financial and legal
advisors.

also updated the SAC on his discussions with representatives of Party E. The SAC instructed Lattice management and
Morgan Stanley to request further information regarding the plans for a new private equity fund and to inquire as to when
financing commitments would be secured, and also instructed Morgan Stanley to engage with Party E and to prepare a list
of other potential suitors for outreach.

Lattice senior management in attendance, and reviewed and asked questions regarding management’s forecasts for 2017
and 2018, including regarding the forecasting process, the revenue forecasts for key new products, and the assumptions,
risks and opportunities reflected in such forecasts. Based on feedback from the Audit Committee, Lattice management
developed a downside scenario showing the impact if Lattice failed to achieve an anticipated design win with a key
customer, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Downside Case.” These management forecasts, including both
the Upside Case and the Downside Case, were subsequently provided to Morgan Stanley for purposes of its valuation
analysis, and subsets of which were also provided to Canyon Bridge. For further information regarding these management
forecasts, please see “The Merger – Certain Prospective Financial Data.”

On September 9, 2016, the SAC held a meeting, with Mr. Bourgoin, Mr. Billerbeck, other members of Lattice senior
management and representatives of Skadden and Morgan Stanley also in attendance. At this meeting, representatives of
Morgan Stanley provided an update on the discussions of a potential CFIUS filing with Canyon Bridge, as well as
remaining outreach efforts with other parties, including that Party P had still not made an offer, and that Party L had
indicated that the timing was not good given recent pressure on their stock price and the likelihood that any offer would
need to include a stock component. The SAC also discussed the updated projections prepared by management, and
discussed analyses with respect to valuation, the prospect for a design win with a key customer, and the operational risks
inherent in the projections. Later on September 9, 2016, Lattice and Canyon Bridge entered into a nondisclosure
agreement on the same terms as were agreed with Party J.

On September 10, 2016, Canyon Bridge submitted a non-binding indication of interest to acquire all of the equity interests
of Lattice for $8.30 per share in an all-cash transaction, contingent upon receipt of final approval from Canyon Bridge’s
investment committee and Lattice’s entry into an exclusivity agreement with Canyon Bridge by September 13, 2016, and
which contemplated Canyon Bridge and Lattice jointly determining whether CFIUS clearance would be required for the
transaction and, if so, that the parties would jointly approach CFIUS as part of the diligence process. The Board was
promptly notified of the non-binding indication of interest. Based on the closing trading price of $5.98 for Lattice common
shares on the previous trading day (September 9, 2016), the proposal implied a premium of 39%.

On September 11, 2016, a representative of Party P informed representatives of Morgan Stanley that Party P was no
longer interested in pursuing a potential transaction with Lattice because such a transaction would not fit with Party P’s
long-term business plans.

one of Lattice’s business units.

Also on September 12, 2016, Party L submitted a proposal to acquire Lattice at a significantly lower price than the offer
from Canyon Bridge.

Later that day, the Board held a meeting, with representatives of Skadden and Morgan Stanley also in attendance. At this
meeting, following discussion, the Board determined not to engage in negotiations with Party L based on the significantly
lower price than the offer by Canyon Bridge. The Board also discussed that no follow up offer or response had been
received from Party C. As no definitive proposal had been received from any of the parties that Morgan Stanley had
engaged with, and after discussion with Morgan Stanley regarding their analysis on valuation, and after further discussion
of the strategic alternatives available to Lattice, including continuing to pursue Lattice’s stand-alone plan, a potential
divestiture of a Lattice business unit, and further cost reduction measures, and the risks associated with design wins with
customers, the Board authorized entry into a new exclusivity agreement with Canyon Bridge, to prevent the offer from
Canyon Bridge from lapsing, and instructed the SAC to supervise the negotiation of the definitive agreement with Canyon
Bridge. At this meeting, Mr. Jensen also discussed the updated management projections developed by Lattice
management previously discussed with the SAC, including the Upside Case and Downside Case. The Non-Management
Lattice Directors then went into executive session and further discussed the strategic alternatives available to Lattice and
the process for negotiations with Canyon Bridge.

On September 13, 2016, Lattice and Canyon Bridge entered into an exclusivity agreement, providing among other things
that Lattice would not initiate discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction with any third party through October 4,
2016, which date would be automatically extended to October 18, 2016 absent affirmative action to the contrary. Also on
September 13, 2016, Jones Day delivered to Skadden an initial draft of the merger agreement, which provided that an
equity commitment letter would be executed simultaneously with the proposed merger agreement, but that no reverse
termination fees would be payable to Lattice in the event of a failure to receive CFIUS approval. The initial draft merger
agreement also provided that at signing an escrow account would be established and funded with an amount equal to the
reverse termination fee, which escrow account would provide Lattice with certainty as to the availability of funds in the
event the reverse termination fee were payable.

Between September 13, 2016 and November 2, 2016, representatives of Lattice management, Morgan Stanley, Skadden,
Canyon Bridge, Lazard and Jones Day held various meetings and calls to negotiate the terms of the proposed merger
agreement, and exchanged drafts of the merger agreement, and Canyon Bridge and its advisors continued to perform their

triggers and the mechanisms for obtaining any payment from the escrow account in the event the reverse termination fee
were payable) and updates on the CFIUS review process with representatives of Skadden, and received an update from
Mr. Billerbeck on the status of negotiations regarding a potential divestiture of one of Lattice’s business units. In response
to Canyon Bridge’s indication in the merger agreement that, given that it intended to retain Lattice senior management
post-transaction, it would seek to discuss post-transaction employment arrangements with certain senior executives in
connection with a transaction, the SAC further resolved that any such discussions should take place only after all of the
material issues in the transaction negotiations had been resolved. Later that day, Skadden delivered to Jones Day a
revised merger agreement draft.

On September 21, 2016, Party E sent a representative of Morgan Stanley an executed copy of Lattice’s Standard Form
NDA, except that in this case the nondisclosure agreement had a 12-month standstill period, and requested a call to

reported that the parties had discussed the potential range of termination fees and reverse termination fees, and had
engaged in extensive discussions regarding the level of efforts required to obtain CFIUS approval, but that these issues
would not be resolved prior to the parties’ meeting with members of CFIUS to better understand whether CFIUS would
have any concerns in connection with this transaction. Mr. Billerbeck also reported that Canyon Bridge had engaged an
accounting firm to conduct additional financial diligence over the coming week.

provided an overview of several minor changes to the terms of the proposed merger agreement since the October 31,
2016 draft and the exclusive forum bylaw amendment that was proposed to be adopted in connection therewith. The Board
discussed the proposed merger agreement at length, including the experience and reputations of Canyon Bridge’s co-
founders, Raymond Bingham and Benjamin Chow, and the other factors considered by the Board as described under the
caption “The Merger — Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger.’’ Representatives of
Morgan Stanley discussed certain financial analyses with the Board, as well as the assumptions and matters considered in
rendering its fairness opinion. Representatives of Morgan Stanley rendered to the Board its oral opinion (later confirmed in
writing) that the $8.30 per share of Lattice common stock offered by Canyon Bridge was fair, from a financial point of view,
to the holders of Lattice common stock. The Board discussed these matters with representatives of Morgan Stanley and
the other participants in the meeting, including the intrinsic value and premium of Canyon Bridge’s offer and other inputs
and assumptions in Morgan Stanley’s valuation analysis.

The meeting then adjourned, members of Lattice senior management and representatives of Morgan Stanley left the
meeting, and a meeting of the SAC commenced, also attended by the Non-Management Lattice Directors and
representatives of Skadden. Members of the SAC discussed the key terms of the merger agreement and thereupon
unanimously resolved to recommend that the Board approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby.

Following the meeting of the SAC, the full Board reconvened. Following the recommendation of the SAC, the members of
the Board unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement were fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Lattice and its stockholders, (2) approved the
form, terms, provisions and conditions of the merger agreement and the consummation of the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (3) resolved to recommend that Lattice’s stockholders vote for the
adoption of the merger agreement, and (4) approved the exclusive forum bylaw amendment.

During the early morning of November 3, 2016, the merger agreement and related documents were executed and
delivered by Lattice, Canyon Bridge, Parent and Merger Sub.

Lattice and Canyon Bridge issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement prior to the
open of trading in Lattice’s common stock on Nasdaq on November 3, 2016.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger
At a meeting held on November 2, 2016, after carefully reviewing various factors and with the unanimous recommendation
of the Strategic Alternatives Committee of the Board, consisting solely of independent and disinterested directors, the
Board unanimously determined that the proposed Merger was advisable and in the best interests of, the stockholders of
Lattice, unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company’s stockholders for adoption, and unanimously
recommend that Lattice’s stockholders vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment
of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the
Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve
compensation that will or may become payable to Lattice’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

In evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the
Board consulted with the Company’s senior management team, as well as its outside legal and financial advisors, and
considered a number of factors, including the following material factors (not in any relative order of importance):

Merger Consideration. With respect to the Merger Consideration to be received by the Company’s stockholders, the
Board considered:
 

 
•  that the Company’s stockholders will be entitled to receive offer consideration of $8.30 per share in cash upon

the closing of the Merger, providing liquidity and certainty of value as compared to the uncertain future long-term
value that the Company’s stockholders might or might not realize if it remained an independent public company;

 

 
•  the fact that the $8.30 per share value of the cash Merger Consideration represented an approximately 30%

premium over the last trading price of the Company’s common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on
November 2, 2016;

 

 •  the recent and historical market prices of the Company’s common stock over the last 12 months and the last fiveand 10 years;
 

 

•  the financial presentation and opinion of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Board, that, based upon and subject to
the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the $8.30 per share Merger Consideration to
be offered in cash to the stockholders of the Company was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
stockholders, as more fully described under the heading “Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor.” The
Board was aware that Morgan Stanley became entitled to certain fees upon delivery of its fairness

 opinion and will become entitled to additional fees upon consummation of the proposed transaction, as more fullydescribed below under the heading “Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor”;
 

 •  its belief, based on the discussions and extensive negotiations with Parent, that $8.30 per share of theCompany’s common stock was the highest price Parent would be willing to pay; and
 

 •  its belief, based on the discussions with several parties other than Parent, that it was unlikely that any other partywould be willing to pay more than $8.30 per share in cash to acquire the Company.

Solicitation of Interest. The Board considered the fact that, prior to entry into an exclusivity agreement with Canyon
Bridge, and at various times during which the exclusivity period had lapsed, the Board, with the assistance of Morgan
Stanley, considered other potential acquirers and solicited interest from other parties that the Board determined would
likely have the financial ability and strategic interest to be potentially interested in a business combination with Lattice, and
that none of the other parties contacted made any superior proposals with respect to an acquisition of the Company.

Cash Consideration. The Board considered the form of consideration to be paid to the stockholders pursuant to the
Merger and the liquidity and certainty of the value of an all-cash consideration compared to stock or other forms of
consideration.

Availability of Funding. The Board reviewed and considered the terms, parties to and structure of the Equity
Commitment Letter provided by Parent, including (1) the reputation of Raymond Bingham and Benjamin Chow, the co-
founders of Canyon Bridge and CBC Partners, (2) that Canyon Bridge has received a capital commitment from a wholly
owned subsidiary of CVC, a large Chinese investment fund, in an amount sufficient to fund its obligations under the Equity
Commitment Letter, (3) the reputation of Canyon Bridge’s investors, (4) the fact that the equity financing provided pursuant
to the Equity Commitment Letter will be sufficient to provide Parent with cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration and any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with
the Merger, (5) that the Equity Commitment Letter was executed substantially concurrently with the Merger Agreement,
and (6) that Parent agreed to deposit $58,750,000 into an escrow account located in the United States and held by
Citibank, N.A. prior to the signing of the Merger Agreement to fund the payment of the reverse termination fee. The Board
also considered the risk that Canyon Bridge was a newly formed private equity fund, that it may not be able to enforce its
capital commitments and that the Company would not be able to force Parent to sue to enforce the Equity Commitment
Letter.

Unanimity. The Board considered that the members of the Board were unanimous in their determination to recommend
the Merger Agreement for adoption by the Company’s stockholders.

Prospects in Remaining Independent. The Board considered the possibility of the Company continuing to operate as an
independent public company, and the risks and uncertainties of achieving the Company’s operating plan and projected
results, including the risks and uncertainties of product development and market acceptance, as well as market and
general economic risks. In considering this alternative, the Board considered the following factors:
 

 
•  the inherent uncertainty of attaining the internal financial projections prepared by the Company’s management

and summarized below under the heading “Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information of the
Company”, including the fact that the Company’s actual results could differ materially from the projected results;

 

 
•  the fact that, even if the Company were to achieve its operating plan and projected results, there would be no

assurance that the implied present value of the Company’s future stock price would exceed the $8.30 per share
cash Merger Consideration;

Table of Contents

 •  the risks involved in the Company’s execution on its strategic plan as an independent company, including:
 

 
•  achieving the Company’s growth plans in light of the current and foreseeable market conditions, including

the risks and uncertainties in the U.S. and global economy generally and the semiconductor industry
specifically;

 

 
•  the Company’s dependence on sales to a concentrated group of customers for a significant part of its

revenues, the fact that the selection process for the Company’s products to be included in its customers’
new products is highly competitive, and the potential significant impact on revenue if any of these
customers reduce their use of the Company’s products;

 

 •  the Company’s dependence upon distributors to generate a significant portion of its revenue and completeorder fulfillment;
 

 •  that the Company’s outstanding indebtedness could reduce its strategic flexibility and liquidity and mayhave other adverse effects on the results of its operations;
 

 •  the risk that the Company may be unable to innovate, develop and introduce new products that achievecustomer and market acceptance;
 

 
•  the dependency of the Company on the efforts and abilities of key members of management and other

technical personnel, and the risk that the Company may be unable to retain such personnel and attract and
retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly product engineers who can respond to market demands
and required product innovation;

 

 •  that consolidation in the industry has resulted in the Company being much smaller in scale than some of itscompetitors, making it harder to fund research and development needed to stay competitive; and
 

 •  the “risk factors” set forth in the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016 andsubsequent reports filed with the SEC.

Opinion of Morgan Stanley. Representatives of Morgan Stanley presented its financial analysis of Parent’s proposed
purchase price of $8.30 per share and then rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) to the
Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its
opinion, the consideration to be offered to the stockholders of the Company in the proposed Merger is fair, from a financial
point of view, to such stockholders. The full text of Morgan Stanley’s written opinion, which sets forth, among other things,
the qualifications and assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations upon the review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B and is incorporated by reference herein in
its entirety.

Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the
course of negotiations thereof, including:
 

 

•  the conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the Merger, including the commitment by Parent to seek to
obtain CFIUS Approval and other applicable regulatory approvals and assume the risks related to certain
conditions and requirements that may be imposed by regulators in connection with securing such approvals, the
absence of a financing condition and Parent’s representations, warranties and covenants related to obtaining
financing for the transaction;

 

 •  the requirement that the Merger will only be effective if approved by the holders of a majority of the outstandingshares of Company common stock;
 

 
•  the Company’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with a third

party, if the Board determines in good faith that the third party has made a Takeover Proposal (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) that is, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal (as defined in the
Merger Agreement);

Table of Contents

 

•  the ability of the Board, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, to
consider and to accept an unsolicited Takeover Proposal that the Board has determined is a Superior Proposal
and terminate the Merger Agreement, upon the payment to Parent of a termination fee of $34,180,000, in order
to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, as long as the Company has complied with
the notice and other requirements set forth in the Merger Agreement;

 

 •  the Board’s belief that the termination fee of $34,180,000 was customary for a transaction of this size and typeand would not preclude or substantially impede a possible Superior Proposal;
 

 •  the Company’s entitlement to a reverse termination fee of $58,750,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminatedunder certain circumstances;
 

 •  an amount equal to the reverse termination fee has been deposited in an escrow fund as collateral and securityfor the payment of the reverse termination fee;
 

 •  the Board’s belief that the Company will retain sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in theordinary course between the execution of the Merger Agreement and consummation of the Merger;
 

 •  the limited conditions to Parent’s obligation to complete the Merger, including the absence of a financingcondition or a need for a vote of Parent’s stockholders; and
 

 

•  that the Company’s stockholders who do not vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and comply with
all the required procedures under DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights, which provides those eligible
stockholders with an opportunity to have a Delaware court determine the fair value of their shares, which may be
more than, less than, or the same as the amount such stockholders would have received under the Merger
Agreement.

In the course of its deliberations, the Board also considered a variety of negative factors weighing against the Merger,
including:

Cash Transaction. The Board considered that the Per Share Merger Consideration is payable solely in cash and, as a
result, the Company’s stockholders will forego any potential future increase in the Company’s value that might result from
the Company’s possible growth, and that gains realized as a result of the Merger generally will be taxable to the
Company’s stockholders.

Risks of Announcement; Risks of Closing. The Board considered:
 

 
•  the risks and contingencies related to the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including the potential

impact on the Company’s employees and its relationships with existing and prospective customers and business
partners, as well as other third parties;

 

 •  the conditions of Parent’s obligation to complete the Merger and the right of Parent to terminate the MergerAgreement under certain specified circumstances;
 

 
•  the risks of a delay in receiving, or a failure to receive, the necessary CFIUS Approval and antitrust clearances to

complete the Merger and the extent of Parent’s obligations to expend efforts in seeking such clearances, and
that no reverse termination fee will be payable in connection with failure to receive such approval;

 

 
•  the risk that the equity financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter will not be obtained, resulting in

Parent not having sufficient funds to complete the Merger, that Parent and Merger Sub will have no assets if the
Equity Commitment Letter is not funded, other than the funds held in escrow, and that the Company has no direct
recourse against Canyon Bridge, CBC Partners or Canyon Bridge’s investors;

Table of Contents

 •  the Company’s limited recourse in case of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub to the amount of the reversetermination fee, even in case of fraud or willful breach;
 

 
•  the Company’s risks and costs if the Merger is not completed, including the diversion of management and

employee attention, potential employee attrition, the potential impact on the Company’s stock price and the effect
on its business relationships;

 

 •  the fact that the Company has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses inconnection with the proposed transaction, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated; and
 

 

•  the Company’s obligations not to solicit proposals or offers that constitute, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, Acquisition Proposals that may be superior to the Merger; the limited circumstances in which we may
enter into, continue, or otherwise participate in any discussions regarding acquisition proposals, or agree to,
accept, or recommend any Acquisition Proposals other than as described above with respect to Superior
Proposals; the ability of Parent to match a Superior Proposal; and the requirement that the Company pay a
$34,180,000 termination fee to Parent related to a termination of the Merger Agreement in connection with a
Superior Proposal in the circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, all of which could dissuade another
party from making an acquisition proposal for the Company.

Limitations on the Company’s Business. The Board considered the potential limitations on the Company’s pursuit of
business opportunities due to pre-closing covenants in the Merger Agreement whereby the Company agreed that it will
carry on the Company’s business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and, subject to specified
exceptions, not to take certain actions related to the conduct of the Company’s business without the prior written consent
of Parent.

Interests of Directors and Officers. The Board was aware of, and considered, the interests that the Company’s directors
and executive officers may have with respect to the Merger in addition to their interests as the Company’s stockholders
generally, as described under the heading “Agreements or Arrangements with Executive Officers and Directors of the
Company.”

The Board concluded that the risks and other potentially negative factors associated with the Merger Agreement were
outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger Agreement.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but
includes the material factors considered by the Board. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the Merger Agreement, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign
relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual
directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate
determination. The Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented.

For the reasons described above, the Board unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and unanimously
recommends that the Company’s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

In considering the recommendation of the Board that the Company’s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement, the Company’s stockholders should be aware that the Company’s directors and executive officers may
have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the other stockholders of the Company. The Board
was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement
and in recommending that the Company’s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

Certain Prospective Financial Data
Lattice does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to its future performance,
earnings or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates.
However, in connection with the Board’s consideration of the proposed Merger, Lattice management prepared two sets of
unaudited financial projections regarding Lattice’s future performance for calendar years 2016 through 2018, which we
refer to in this proxy statement as the “Management Projections.” The first set of unaudited financial projections assumed a
certain amount of revenue from product sales resulting from a business arrangement with a key customer, which we refer
to in this proxy statement as the “Upside Case.” The second set of unaudited financial projections assumed that Lattice
would not obtain this design win and thus forecasted lower sales revenue, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the
“Downside Case.” These projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure. Rather, these projections were
prepared for internal use and provided to the Board for the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating Lattice’s
strategic and financial alternatives, including the Merger. At the direction of the Board, these projections were provided to
Morgan Stanley in connection with its financial analyses during the strategic and financial review process, and in rendering
its fairness opinion to the Board described below under the heading “Fairness Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,” and
a subset of these projections (including the revenue, operating margin, projected EBIT and projected EBITDA line items)
were also provided to Canyon Bridge and Parent in connection with its due diligence. In addition, at the direction of
management and as described below, based on these projections and in connection with its financial analyses, Morgan
Stanley extrapolated the financial projections for certain financial measures for calendar years 2017 through 2018, and for
all financial measures for calendar years 2019 through the terminal year 2024, which extrapolations were discussed with,
and approved by, Lattice management for Morgan Stanley’s use in connection with its financial analyses and provided to
the Board. These extrapolations were not provided to Canyon Bridge or Parent. In addition, at the direction of
management, Morgan Stanley calculated Lattice’s unlevered free cash flows for each period, including the Management
Projections period, which calculations were discussed with, and approved for use by, Lattice management. We refer to
these projections and extrapolations in this proxy statement collectively as the “Forecasts.”

The Forecasts do not, and were not intended to, act as public guidance regarding our financial performance, and the
inclusion of the Forecasts in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Board, Lattice
management, Morgan Stanley or any of their respective affiliates or representatives or any other recipient of this
information considered, or now considers, the Forecasts to be predictive of future results. Furthermore, the Forecasts were
not prepared with a view to compliance with (1) GAAP, (2) the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and
forward-looking statements, or (3) the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for
preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. KPMG LLP, our independent registered public
accountant, has not examined, reviewed, compiled or otherwise applied procedures to the Forecasts and, accordingly,
assumes no responsibility for, and expresses no opinion on, them. The Forecasts included in this proxy statement have
been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Lattice management.

Although a summary of the Forecasts is presented with numerical specificity, the Forecasts reflect numerous estimates,
assumptions and judgments (in addition to those described below) as to future events made by Lattice management that
they believed were reasonable at the time the Forecasts were prepared, taking into account the relevant information
available to Lattice management at the time. In developing the Forecasts, Lattice management made assumptions with
respect to Lattice’s performance, general business, economic, regulatory, litigation, geopolitical, market and financial
conditions, as well as industry and Lattice specific factors such as supply and demand trends and the status of, and
estimated revenues from, new products, all of which involve a high degree of uncertainty and are difficult to predict, and
many of which are beyond Lattice’s control. Important factors that may

affect actual results and cause the Forecasts not to be achieved include general economic or industry conditions, Lattice’s
ability to achieve forecasted sales, gross margins or operating expenses, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions,
changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures and changes in tax laws. In addition, the Forecasts do
not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give effect
to the Merger. There can be no assurance that the Forecasts will be realized and actual results may be materially better or
worse than those contained in the Forecasts. The Forecasts cover multiple years, and such information by its nature
becomes less reliable with each successive year.

The summary of the Forecasts is not included in this proxy statement to induce any stockholder to vote in favor of the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting. We do not
intend to update or otherwise revise the Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect
the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Forecasts are shown to
be in error or no longer appropriate. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Forecasts,
stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the projections included in this proxy
statement.

Additionally, the Forecasts are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause Lattice’s future
results to materially vary, see the information under the section captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.”

(1) Revenue was projected for calendar years 2016 through 2018 by Lattice management based upon historical results and management’s forecasts

and was projected for calendar years 2019 through 2023 and subsequent years based upon extrapolations prepared by Morgan Stanley and
approved for use by Lattice management.

(2) Projected Gross Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents projected GAAP gross margin, adjusted to exclude stock-based
compensation of approximately $1 million in 2016, and approximately $2 million in 2017 and 2018. Projected Gross Margin was projected for
calendar years 2016 through 2018 by Lattice management based upon historical results and forecasted Revenue.

(3) Projected Operating Expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents projected GAAP operating expenses, adjusted to exclude
restructuring expenses of approximately $8 million in 2016, acquisition-related charges of less than $500 thousand in 2016, 2017, and 2018,
amortization of acquired intangible assets of $34 million in 2016 and $36 million in 2017 and 2018, and stock-based compensation of $16 million in
2016 and $18 million in 2017 and 2018. Projected Operating Expenses was projected for calendar years 2016 through 2018 by Lattice management
based upon historical results, forecasted Revenue, and certain expected strategic objectives and events that may not occur. A reconciliation of
Projected Operating Expenses to GAAP operating expenses would be as follows. Under the Upside Case, GAAP operating expenses are projected
to be $241 million in 2016, $222 million in 2017 and $240 million in 2018. Under the Downside Case, GAAP operating expenses are projected to be
$241 million in 2016, $222 million in 2017 and $230 million in 2018.

(4) Projected EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents projected earnings before interest of $21 million in 2016, 2017, and 2018, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, as defined for purposes of Lattice’s existing debt agreements, and represents projected GAAP net income, adjusted to
exclude interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation,
restructuring charges and other non-cash income or expenses. Projected EBITDA was projected for calendar years 2016 through 2018 by Lattice
management based upon historical results and management’s forecasts, and was projected for calendar years 2019 through 2023 and subsequent
years based upon extrapolations prepared by Morgan Stanley and approved for use by Lattice management. A reconciliation of Projected EBITDA to
GAAP net (loss) income would be as follows. Under the Upside Case, GAAP net (loss) income is projected to be ($30) million in 2016, $22 million in
2017 and $31 million in 2018. Under the Downside Case, GAAP net (loss) income is projected to be ($30) million for 2016, $5 million for 2017 and
$17 million for 2018.

(5) Projected EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents projected earnings before interest and taxes and was projected for calendar years
2016 through 2018 by multiplying projected Revenue, determined as set forth above, by the projected EBIT Margin, which was projected based upon
historical results and management’s forecasts. Projected EBIT was projected for calendar years 2019 through 2023 and subsequent years based
upon extrapolations prepared by Morgan Stanley and approved for use by Lattice management. A reconciliation of Projected EBIT to GAAP
operating income would be as follows. Under the Upside Case, GAAP operating income is projected to be ($4) million in 2016, $51 million in 2017
and $63 million in 2018. Under the Downside Case, GAAP operating income is projected to be ($4) million for 2016, $30 million for 2017 and $45
million for 2018.

(6) Projected Taxes is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents Lattice management’s best estimate of projected cash taxes payable considering
international income and withholding taxes, as well as expected utilization of net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for U.S. taxes. Specific
estimates relative to future utilization of NOL carryforwards were not quantified. Rather, considering the magnitude of Lattice’s NOL carryforwards,
NOL utilization was assumed to entirely offset U.S. taxable income. Projected Taxes was projected for calendar years 2016 through 2018 by Lattice
management based upon historical results and management’s forecasts of international income and withholding taxes, and was projected for
calendar years 2019 through 2023 and subsequent years based upon extrapolations prepared by Morgan Stanley and approved for use by Lattice
management, such extrapolations assuming $8.0 million of projected cash taxes per year until 2023 and a 35% effective tax rate for subsequent
years based upon historical results and management’s forecasts for GAAP tax expense. A reconciliation of Projected Taxes to GAAP tax expense
would be as follows. Under the Upside Case, GAAP tax expense is projected to be $8 million in 2016, $7 million in 2017 and $9 million in 2018.
Under the Downside Case, GAAP tax expense is projected to be $6 million in 2016, $3 million in 2017 and $6 million in 2018.

(7) Projected NOPAT is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net operating profits after tax, and was estimated by taking Projected EBIT and
subtracting Projected Taxes, each determined as set forth above.

(8) Projected Depreciation & Amortization is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents projected depreciation and amortization, and was derived by
taking Projected EBITDA and subtracting Projected EBIT, each determined as set forth above.

(9) Projected Stock-Based Compensation is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents projected expenses related to stock-based compensation,
and was projected for calendar year 2016 based upon historical results and management’s forecasts, and was projected for calendar years 2017
through 2023 and subsequent years based upon extrapolations prepared by Morgan Stanley and approved for use by Lattice management.

(10) Change in Net Working Capital is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents projected changes in the amount of Lattice’s current assets less the
amount of Lattice’s current liabilities, and was projected for calendar year 2016 based upon historical results and management’s forecasts, and was
projected for calendar years 2017 through 2023 and subsequent years based upon extrapolations prepared by Morgan Stanley and approved for use
by Lattice management.

(11) Projected Capital Expenditures is a non-GAAP financial measure of projected capital expenditures, and was projected for calendar year 2016 based
upon historical results and management’s forecasts, and was projected for calendar years 2017 through 2023 and subsequent years based upon
extrapolations prepared by Morgan Stanley and approved for use by Lattice management.

(12) Unlevered Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure of projected cash flows, and was estimated by taking Projected NOPAT, and adding
Projected Depreciation and Amortization, and adding (subtracting) Projected Stock-Based Compensation, Change in Net Working Capital, and
Projected Capital Expenditures, each determined as set forth above.

As noted above, the Forecasts reflect numerous estimates and assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to our
business, all of which are difficult to predict, and many of which are beyond our control.

Fairness Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of the date of the opinion. It does not address any other aspect or
implications of the Merger. The opinion was addressed to, and rendered for the benefit of, the Board and was not
intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation to any holder of Lattice common shares as to
how to vote at any stockholders’ meeting to be held in connection with the Merger or take any action with respect
to the Merger. The summary of Morgan Stanley’s opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the full text of the opinion.

In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:
 

 •  reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of Lattice;
 

 •  reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Lattice;
 

 •  reviewed the Forecasts;
 

 •  discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Lattice with seniorexecutives of Lattice;
 

 •  reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Lattice common shares;
 

 •  compared the financial performance of Lattice and the prices and trading activity of the Lattice common shareswith that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with Lattice and its securities;
 

 •  reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;
 

 •  participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of Lattice and Parent and theirfinancial and legal advisors;
 

 •  reviewed drafts of (1) the Merger Agreement, (2) the Equity Commitment Letter, and (3) certain relateddocuments; and
 

 •  performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as MorganStanley deemed appropriate.

In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by
Lattice and that formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With respect to the Forecasts, Morgan Stanley assumed that
they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of Lattice of the future financial performance of Lattice. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Merger
will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or
delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Parent will obtain financing in accordance with the
terms set forth in the draft Equity Commitment Letter. Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the
necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the Merger, no delays, limitations,
conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected
to be derived in the Merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor
only and relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of Lattice and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors
with respect to legal, tax, or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley’s opinion is limited to and addresses only the fairness,
from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the consideration to be received by the holders of Lattice
common shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of

amount or nature of any compensation to any of the Lattice officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons,
relative to the consideration to be received by the holders of Lattice common shares in the Merger. Morgan Stanley did not
make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Lattice, nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with
any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market, and
other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley as of, November 2, 2016. Events
occurring after November 2, 2016 may affect Morgan Stanley’s opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and
Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral
opinion and the preparation of its written opinion dated November 2, 2016. The following summary is not a complete
description of Morgan Stanley’s opinion or the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in
connection with rendering its opinion, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight
given to those analyses. In connection with arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered all of its analyses as a whole
and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis described below. Considering any portion of these analyses and
factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the
process underlying Morgan Stanley’s opinion. The various analyses summarized below were based on the closing price of
$6.37 per Lattice common share as of November 2, 2016 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the
Merger). Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Furthermore, mathematical
analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data referred to
below.

In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley utilized and relied
upon certain non-public financial projections provided by the management of Lattice and referred to below. In certain
instances, the projections were extrapolated for future periods not accounted for in the Forecasts provided by the
management of Lattice. For further information regarding these financial projections, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “— Certain Prospective Financial Data.”

Public Trading Valuation Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a public trading valuation analysis, which is designed to provide an implied public trading
valuation of a company by comparing representative trading multiples of companies engaged in a similar business.
Morgan Stanley compared certain financial information of Lattice with comparable publicly available estimates for selected
semiconductor companies that, in Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, share similar business
characteristics and have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized
revenue and/or revenue growth rates, market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating
characteristics. A list of the selected comparable companies and a summary of Morgan Stanley’s analysis is provided
below:
 

   
CY2017E AV

/ Revenue    
CY 2017E AV /

EBITDA    CY 2017E P / E 
Cirrus Logic, Inc.    2.3x     9.0x     13.0x  
Cypress Semiconductor Corporation    2.1x     11.1x     13.6x  
Integrated Device Technology, Inc.    4.1x     11.4x     15.0x  
Microchip Technology Incorporated    5.0x     12.5x     16.0x  
Microsemi Corporation    3.8x     9.3x     10.6x  
Semtech Corporation    2.9x     9.3x     15.1x  
Xilinx, Inc.    4.6x     14.7x     21.8x  

For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed (1) the ratio of aggregate value, which we refer to in this proxy
statement as “AV”, which Morgan Stanley defined as fully diluted market capitalization plus total debt less cash and cash
equivalents, to each of estimated revenue and EBITDA (which is defined in this section as net income excluding net
interest expense, income tax expense and certain other non-cash and non-recurring items, principally depreciation,
amortization and stock-based compensation and charges) for calendar year 2017, and (2) estimated price to earnings
(which is defined in this section as the ratio of price per share to estimated diluted earnings per share) for calendar year
2017, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “2017 PE Multiple”, in each case, for each of the comparable
companies based on publicly available financial information compiled by Thomson Reuters for comparison purposes.

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and upon the application of its
professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley selected representative ranges of revenue, EBITDA, and price to
earnings multiples and applied these ranges of multiples to the estimated relevant metric for Lattice. Based on the
outstanding Lattice common shares on a fully-diluted basis (including outstanding options and restricted stock units) as of
November 2, 2016, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per share of Lattice common shares as of
November 2, 2016 as follows:
 

Calendar Year Financial Statistic  

Selected
Comparable

Company Multiple
Ranges  

Implied Present
Value Per Share of
Company Common

Stock ($)
AV to Estimated 2017 Revenue of $483MM(1)     2.0x – 3.0x  5.82 – 9.36
AV to Estimated 2017 EBITDA of $108MM(2)   9.0x – 13.0x  5.88 – 9.05
Price to Estimated 2017 Earnings of $0.49 per

(1) The estimated 2017 revenue forecast used for this analysis was based on the median of the analyst estimates of Lattice’s revenue for the year 2017,

based on analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters as of November 2, 2016.
(2) The estimated 2017 EBITDA forecast used for this analysis was based on the median of the analyst estimates of Lattice’s 2017 EBIT, and projected

depreciation and amortization charges were determined by applying management’s forecast of

 depreciation and amortization charges as a percentage of revenue to the analyst estimates of 2017 revenue compiled by Thomson Reuters as ofNovember 2, 2016.
(3) The estimated 2017 earnings per share forecast used for this analysis was based on the median of the analyst estimates of Lattice’s earnings per

share for the year 2017, based on analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters as of November 2, 2016.

No company utilized in the public trading valuation analysis is identical to Lattice. In evaluating comparable companies,
Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions, and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Lattice, such as the impact of
competition on the businesses of Lattice and the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse
material change in the financial condition and prospects of Lattice.

Discounted Equity Valuation Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity valuation analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the potential
future equity value of a company as a function of such company’s estimated future earnings. The resulting equity value is
subsequently discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied present value of such company’s equity value. In
connection with this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity values per share of Lattice
common shares on a standalone basis. The discounted equity value was calculated by Morgan Stanley using estimated
earnings for calendar year 2018. Based on its review of the 2017 PE Multiple for the comparable companies, and upon the
application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley then applied a selected range of earnings
multiples to the estimates of earnings for calendar year 2018 provided by management in two sets of unaudited financial
projections prepared by Lattice management: (1) the Upside Case, which assumed a certain amount of revenue from a
design win with a key customer, and (2) the Downside Case, which assumed lower sales revenue if that design win is not
achieved, to calculate the estimated equity values for Lattice based on each such case.

Morgan Stanley then discounted each such equity value to present value using a discount rate of 10.8%, which rate was
selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of
Lattice’s cost of equity.

Based on the number of Lattice common shares outstanding as of November 2, 2016 on a fully-diluted basis (including
outstanding options and restricted stock units), as provided by Lattice’s management, Morgan Stanley calculated the
estimated implied value per share of Lattice’s common shares using the discounted equity valuation analysis as of
November 2, 2016 as follows:
 

Calendar Year Estimated 2018 Earnings   
Selected Earnings
Multiple Ranges   

Implied Present
Value Per Share of
Company Common

Stock ($)
Upside Case   10.0x – 16.0x   6.13 – 9.81
Downside Case   10.0x – 14.0x   5.32 – 7.45

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company
by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of the company. Morgan Stanley
calculated ranges of equity values per Lattice common share based on discounted cash flow analyses until December 31,
2023. For purposes of this analysis, Lattice was considered as a standalone entity. Morgan Stanley relied on the Upside
Case and the Downside Case for fiscal years 2016 to 2018, extrapolated those projections through 2023 (as discussed
with and approved by Lattice management) and used the following assumptions: (1) $8 million per year in taxes

as a cash expense, and (2) a 35% tax rate in the terminal year, as described above under “The Merger – Certain
Prospective Financial Data.” Morgan Stanley then calculated a range of implied values of Lattice by calculating a range of
the present values of Lattice’s free cash flows for the period from November 2, 2016, through December 31, 2023, and a
terminal value based on a terminal perpetual growth rate ranging from 1.0% to 3.0%. Morgan Stanley selected these
terminal perpetual growth rates based on the application of its professional judgment and experience. The free cash flows
were discounted to present values as of November 2, 2016, at a range of discount rates of 8.6% to 10.0% (which range
was selected in Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience) to reflect Lattice’s weighted average cost of
capital. The terminal values were discounted to present values as of November 2, 2016, at a range of discount rates of
8.0% to 9.4% (which range was selected in Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience) to reflect Lattice’s
weighted average cost of capital assuming a fully burdened tax rate. These calculations resulted in the following ranges:
 

   

Implied Present Value Per
Share of Company
Common Stock ($)

Upside Case   6.96 – 10.31
Downside Case   6.08 –   9.12

Precedent Transactions Analysis
Precedent Multiples. Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a
company based on publicly available financial terms and premia of selected transactions that share some characteristics
with the Merger. In connection with its analysis, Morgan Stanley compared publicly available statistics for selected
semiconductor technology transactions, selected based on Morgan Stanley’s professional judgment and experience. The
transactions reviewed and the date that each transaction was announced were as follows:

For each transaction listed above, Morgan Stanley noted (1) the ratio of AV of the transaction to the target company’s
(a) last twelve month, which we refer to in this proxy statement as “LTM”, revenue and next twelve month, which we refer
to in this proxy statement as “NTM”, revenue, and (b) LTM EBITDA and NTM EBITDA and (2) the LTM price to earnings
and NTM price to earnings. The following table summarizes the mean, median, 1st Quartile, and 3rd Quartile multiples of
the transactions listed above for these various metrics.

3rd Quartile  33.4x  29.6x  3.8x  3.4x  18.9x  17.5x

Based on the analysis of the relevant metrics and time frame for each transaction listed above, Morgan Stanley selected
the representative range of multiples in each case below and applied these ranges of multiples to Lattice’s forecasts. The
ranges of implied values per Lattice common share were:
 

Multiples   

Implied Present Value
Per Share of

Company Common Stock ($)
AV / LTM Revenue (2.0x – 3.8x)   4.63 – 10.06
AV / NTM Revenue (2.0x – 3.5x)   5.59 – 10.74
AV / LTM EBITDA (13.0x – 19.0x)   2.14  –  4.00
AV / NTM EBITDA (10.0x – 17.0x)   6.09 – 11.21

NTM P / E (18.0x – 30.0x)   7.49 – 12.48

Precedent Premia. Morgan Stanley considered, based on publicly available information, premiums paid in all-cash
acquisition transactions in Morgan Stanley’s transaction database occurring from 2011 through November 2, 2016,
involving U.S. public company targets in the technology sector having a transaction value of more than $250 million (127
total transactions). Morgan Stanley reviewed the premium paid to the target company’s closing stock price one day, 30
days and LTM high premium

prior to market awareness of such transaction. Morgan Stanley’s analysis identified the following premium ranges:
 

Financial Statistic   

Premium to
1-Day Prior

Price   

Premium to

Prior Price   

Premium to

Median    32.5%   37.9%   0.4% 
Bottom Quartile    21.1%   25.1%   (4.8%) 

Based on the top and bottom quartiles, Morgan Stanley then applied premium ranges of 20% to 50% to Lattice’s one-day
prior stock price, 25% to 50% to Lattice’s 30-day average prior stock price and (5%) to 10% to Lattice’s 52-week high stock
price, in each case prior to November 2, 2016 (the last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger). The
analysis indicated an implied value per share of Lattice common shares reference range as follows:
 

Financial Statistic   

Implied Present Value
Per Share of

Company Common Stock ($) 
Premium to 1-Day Prior Price    7.64 – 9.56  
Premium to 30-Day Prior Price    7.97 – 9.57  
Premium to 52-week High Price    6.43 – 7.45  

Additional Information. No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to Lattice or
the Merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to
industry performance, general business, market and financial conditions and other matters that are beyond the control of
Lattice, such as the impact of competition on the business of Lattice or its industry generally, industry growth and the
absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition of Lattice or its industry or in the financial markets in
general, all of which could affect the public trading value of the companies and the aggregate value and equity value of the
transactions to which they are being compared. Morgan Stanley considered a number of factors in analyzing the implied
Merger consideration. That points in the range of implied present values per Lattice common share derived from the
valuation of precedent transactions were less than or greater than the implied Merger consideration is not necessarily
dispositive in connection with Morgan Stanley’s analysis of the implied Merger consideration, but one of many factors that
Morgan Stanley considered.

Historical Trading Ranges Analysis
Morgan Stanley performed a trading range analysis with respect to the historical share prices of Lattice common shares.
Morgan Stanley reviewed the range of closing prices of Lattice common shares for various periods ending on November 2,
2016. Morgan Stanley also reviewed the historical trading multiples for Lattice. Morgan Stanley observed the following:
 

Period Ending November 2, 2016   Range of Closing Prices
Last Month   6.01 – 6.56
Last Three Months   5.71 – 6.56
Last Twelve Months   4.32 – 6.77

Analysts’ Price Targets
Morgan Stanley reviewed and analyzed future public market trading price targets for Lattice common shares prepared and
published by equity research analysts prior to November 2, 2016. These future share price targets reflected each analyst’s
estimate of the future public market trading price of Lattice common shares and were not discounted to reflect present
values. The range of undiscounted analysts’ future share price targets for Lattice common shares was $6.75 to $8.00 per
share as of November 2, 2016. In order to better compare the equity research analysts’ future share price targets with the
per share Merger consideration, Morgan Stanley discounted the range of analysts’ future share price targets for Lattice
common shares for one year at a rate of 10.8%, which discount rate was selected based on Lattice’s cost of equity. This
analysis indicated an implied range of equity values for Lattice common shares of $6.09 to $7.22 per share.

The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market
trading prices for Lattice common shares, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial
performance of Lattice and future financial market conditions.

General
In connection with the review of the Merger by the Board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative
analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered
the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it
considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all of the analyses as a
whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley
may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed
various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from
any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley’s view of the actual value of Lattice. In
performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general
business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters that are beyond the control of Lattice.
These include, among other things, the impact of competition on the business of Lattice and the industry generally,
industry growth, and the absence of any material adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of Lattice and
the industry, and in financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley’s analyses are not necessarily
indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by
such estimates.

Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness from a financial point
of view the consideration to be received by the holders of Lattice common shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement and
in connection with the delivery of its opinion, dated November 2, 2016, to the Board. These analyses do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which Lattice common shares might actually trade.

The consideration to be received by the holders of Lattice common shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was
determined by Lattice and Parent through arm’s length negotiations between Lattice and Parent and was approved by the
Board. Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor to the Board during these negotiations but did not recommend any
specific consideration to Lattice or the Board or opine that any specific amount or form of consideration constituted the only
appropriate amount or form of consideration for the Merger.

Morgan Stanley’s opinion and its presentation to the Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board
in deciding to adopt resolutions to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the Merger. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the
Board with respect to the consideration to be received by the holders of Lattice common shares pursuant to the Merger
Agreement or of whether the Board would have been willing to agree to a different form or amount of consideration.
Morgan Stanley’s opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in
accordance with Morgan Stanley’s customary practice.

Morgan Stanley’s opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a recommendation to any holder of
Lattice common shares as to how to vote at any stockholders’ meetings to be held in connection with the Merger. Morgan
Stanley’s opinion did not address any other aspect of the Merger or related transactions, including the prices at which
Lattice common shares would trade at any time in the future.

The Board retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley’s qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan
Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth
management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities,
foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking,
financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a
principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise
structure and effect transactions, for their own account or for the accounts of their customers, in debt or equity securities or
loans of Lattice, Parent or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or any related derivative instrument. In addition, Morgan Stanley, its affiliates,
directors or officers, including individuals working with Lattice in connection with the Merger, may commit in the future to
invest in private equity funds managed by Canyon Bridge.

Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Board with financial advisory services and a
financial opinion in connection with the Merger, described in this section and attached to this proxy statement as Annex B,
and Lattice has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee for its services in an amount estimated, as of the date of Morgan
Stanley’s written opinion, to be approximately $18 million, 25% of which was due upon announcement of the transaction
and the remainder of which is contingent upon the completion of the Merger. Lattice has also agreed to reimburse Morgan
Stanley for its reasonable expenses, including reasonable fees of outside counsel and other professional advisors,
incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, Lattice has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates,
their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any
of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses relating to or arising out of Morgan Stanley’s engagement.

In the two years prior to the date of its opinion, except for the engagement related to this transaction, Morgan Stanley and
its affiliates have not been engaged on any financial advisory or financing assignments for Lattice, and have not received
any fees for such services from Lattice during that time. In the two years prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley
and its affiliates have not received any fees for financial advisory or financing assignments for Parent, Merger Sub or
Canyon Bridge.

Interests of Lattice’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different
from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally, as more fully

described below. The Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time,
among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and recommending that the Merger Agreement
be adopted by stockholders.

The consummation of the Merger is expected to constitute a “change in control” for purposes of each of the Lattice
compensation plans and agreements.

Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
The Merger Agreement provides that the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) honor all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
of each former and present director or officer of Lattice or any of its subsidiaries, as provided in Lattice’s or its subsidiaries’
organizational documents or in any contract with Lattice or its subsidiaries, as in effect on the date of the Merger
Agreement, for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time.

In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, during the six year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent will
cause to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies in effect as
of the Effective Time by Lattice and its subsidiaries on terms and conditions not less favorable to the insured parties than
the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Lattice with respect to claims arising from
facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event will Parent be
required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by
Lattice for such insurance policy in effect on July 1, 2016, and if the premium for that insurance coverage would exceed
that amount, Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain the greatest coverage available for a
cost equal to that amount. The Merger agreement also provides that, in lieu of the foregoing, Lattice or Parent may
purchase a six-year pre-paid “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy on terms and conditions not less
favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies currently maintained by Lattice
with respect to claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective Time, provided
that the premium of such “tail” policy will not exceed the Maximum Amount without Parent’s consent. For more information,
see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement — Indemnification and Insurance.”

Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock Units
Stock Options

Except as described in this section, Company Stock Options held by our directors and executive officers will be treated like
all other Company Stock Options at the Effective Time. For more information about the treatment of Company Stock
Options in the Merger, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Equity-
Based Awards.”

Single Trigger Accelerated Vesting of Company Options Held by Non-Employee Directors of Lattice

In connection with the Merger, the vesting of any Unvested Company Options held by each non-employee director of
Lattice will fully accelerate pursuant to the terms of such Unvested Company Options and, after giving effect to such
acceleration, such Unvested Company Options will be treated as Vested Company Options as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the Merger Agreement.

Table of Contents

Treatment of Performance-Based Options

With respect to any performance-based In-the-Money Company Options that are outstanding at or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Performance-Based Company Options”, Lattice will
measure actual performance for any performance period that is ongoing at the Effective Time as of the last business day
prior to the Effective Time, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Measurement Date.” Solely to the extent
performance is so achieved, the number of Performance-Based Company Options will be prorated based on the number of
days that have elapsed from the date of grant through the Effective Time during the applicable performance period, with
the resulting number of Performance-Based Company Options becoming Vested Company Options as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time under the Merger Agreement. Any portion of the Performance-Based Company Options for which
performance is not so achieved will be canceled at the Effective Time for no consideration.

Treatment of Unvested Company Options Held by Mr. Billerbeck

In connection with the Merger, on November 3, 2016, Mr. Billerbeck entered into a letter agreement with Parent and
Lattice, pursuant to which, consistent with the terms of Mr. Billerbeck’s employment agreement, any outstanding and
unvested In-the-Money Company Options held by Mr. Billerbeck prior to the closing date of the Merger (after taking into
account any vesting related to the satisfaction of any corporate performance goals) will not accelerate and become fully
vested at or prior to the Effective Time, and, as with other holders of outstanding and unvested In-the-Money Company
Options, will instead be treated as Unvested Company Options under the Merger Agreement. Thereafter, consistent with
the terms of Mr. Billerbeck’s employment agreement, Mr. Billerbeck’s letter agreement provides that if, prior to the second
anniversary of the closing date of the Merger, Mr. Billerbeck’s employment is terminated by Lattice without cause or by
Mr. Billerbeck for good reason, then any such Unvested Company Options will become fully vested effective as of the date
of such termination, subject to his satisfaction of certain conditions pursuant to his employment agreement. For further
detail regarding the terms of Mr. Billerbeck’s letter agreement, see the section captioned “The Merger — Interests of
Lattice’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Arrangements with Parent.”

Treatment of Company Options Held by Mr. Hawk

In connection with the Merger, on November 3, 2016, Mr. Hawk entered into a letter agreement with Parent and Lattice,
pursuant to which all outstanding Company Stock Options held by Mr. Hawk as of November 3, 2016, whether vested or
unvested, will be treated as Vested Company Options as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Merger Agreement. For further detail regarding the terms of Mr. Hawk’s
letter agreement, see the section captioned “ The Merger — Interests of Lattice’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger — Arrangements with Parent.”

Restricted Stock Units
Except as described in this section, Company RSUs held by our directors and executive officers will be treated like all
other Company RSUs at the Effective Time. For more information about the treatment of Company RSUs in the Merger,
see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.”

Single Trigger Accelerated Vesting of Company RSUs Held by Non-Employee Directors of Lattice

In connection with the Merger, the vesting of each Company RSU held by each non-employee director of Lattice will fully
accelerate pursuant to the terms of such Company RSUs and, after giving effect to such acceleration, such Company
RSUs will be treated as Vested RSUs as of immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Merger Agreement.

Single Trigger Accelerated Vesting of Certain Company RSUs Held by Lattice Employees, including our Executive Officers

All Company RSUs granted pursuant to Lattice’s 2013 Incentive Plan (as amended) or Lattice’s 1996 Stock Incentive Plan
(as amended) are subject to single trigger accelerated vesting at the Effective Time pursuant to the standard form of award
agreement for such Company RSUs, which provides that in the event of a change in control of Lattice, if the acquiring
corporation is not a “publicly held corporation” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the
Company RSUs issued pursuant to such award agreement will fully vest at the time of such change in control. Because
Parent is not a publicly held corporation, the vesting of such Company RSUs will fully accelerate upon the change in
control of Lattice and, after giving effect to such acceleration, such Company RSUs will be treated as Vested RSUs under
the Merger Agreement.

Company Options and Company RSUs Canceled in Exchange for Merger Consideration Payable at Closing

The table below provides detail as to the value of the outstanding Vested Company Options, Unvested Company Options,
Vested RSUs and Unvested RSUs (in each case, after taking into account any accelerated vesting that is required to occur
at or prior to the Effective Time) held by Lattice’s directors and executive officers that will be canceled and converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect thereof payable in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement for the respective award. The amounts listed below are estimates based on an assumed closing date of
January 23, 2017, and based on the number of Company Stock Options and Company RSUs held by each director and
executive officer as of such date. However, the actual number of awards that will be canceled and converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration will depend on the number of outstanding awards held by such individuals
at the Effective Time.

(1) For Unvested Company Options held by non-employee directors of Lattice, the vesting of each Unvested Company Option will fully accelerate upon

completion of the Merger pursuant to the terms of such Unvested Company Option; as such, outstanding Unvested Company Options held by each
non-employee director as of January 23, 2017 are treated as Vested Company Options and are included in this computation as such.
For Performance-Based Company Options held by executive officers, the amount shown includes the value of Performance-Based Company
Options held by the executive officer as of January 23, 2017 that will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as of

have elapsed from the date of grant through the Effective Time. Assuming that the maximum level of performance is achieved (instead of target) and
prorated based on the number of days that have elapsed from the date of grant through the Effective Time, the payout for the Performance-Based
Company Options held by executive officers would increase by $443,995 for Mr. Billerbeck, $0 for Mr. Downing, $41,353 for Mr. Hawk, and $91,776
for Mr. Milstead.

(2) Consistent with Mr. Billerbeck’s employment agreement with Lattice, Mr. Billerbeck’s letter agreement with Parent and Lattice, dated November 3,
2016, provides that any outstanding and unvested In-the-Money Company Options held by Mr. Billerbeck prior to the closing date of the Merger (after
taking into account any vesting related to the satisfaction of any corporate performance goals) will not accelerate and become fully vested at or prior
to the Effective Time, but will instead be treated as Unvested Company Options, subject to accelerated vesting if Mr. Billerbeck’s employment is
terminated either by Lattice without cause or by Mr. Billerbeck for good reason prior to the second anniversary of the closing date of the Merger. The
amount shown for Mr. Billerbeck includes the value of such Unvested Company Options.
For further detail, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger — Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock Units —Treatment of
Unvested Company Options Held by Mr. Billerbeck.”

(3) Vesting of outstanding Company RSUs held by non-employee directors of Lattice will fully accelerate upon completion of the Merger pursuant to the
terms of such Company RSUs; as such, outstanding Company RSUs held by each non-employee director as of January 23, 2017 are treated as
Vested RSUs and are included in this computation as such.
All Company RSUs that were granted pursuant to Lattice’s 2013 Incentive Plan (as amended) or Lattice’s 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended),
which includes all Company RSUs that are held by the executive officers, are subject to single trigger accelerated vesting at the Effective Time
pursuant to the standard form of award agreement evidencing such Company RSUs, and, after giving effect to such acceleration, such Company
RSUs will be treated as Vested RSUs under the Merger Agreement. The amount shown for each executive officer includes the value of such Vested
RSUs.

(4) Represents an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares subject to such Vested Company Option by (2) the
amount by which $8.30 exceeds the per share exercise price of such Vested Company Option.

(5) Represents an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares subject to such Unvested Company Option by (2) the
amount by which $8.30 exceeds the per share exercise price of such Unvested Company Option.

(6) Represents an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) $8.30 by (2) the number of shares that remain subject to such Vested RSU.
(7) As a result of the single-trigger vesting acceleration provided under the terms of the Company RSUs held by each of Lattice’s directors and executive

officers, none of Lattice’s directors or executive officers will hold any Unvested RSUs at the Effective Time.

Executive Employment Agreements
Messrs. Billerbeck, Hawk and Milstead

Each of Messrs. Billerbeck, Hawk and Milstead has entered into an employment agreement with Lattice. Each of the
employment agreements includes a “double trigger” change in control severance provision, whereby if the executive’s
employment is terminated either by Lattice without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason” (as those terms are
defined in the applicable employment agreement, as modified by the letter agreements entered into with Lattice and Parent
described below) immediately prior to a change in control or within 24 months following such change in control, then the
executive will be entitled to receive the following payments and benefits:
 

 
•  A lump sum cash payment equal to 2.0 (in the case of Mr. Billerbeck) or 1.0 (in the case of each executive other

than Mr. Billerbeck) times the sum of the executive’s then-current annual base salary and his target annual bonus
amount (with no proration);

 

 
•  Full acceleration of the vesting of the executive’s then-outstanding compensatory equity awards (as defined in

the applicable employment agreement, as modified by the letter agreements entered into with Lattice and Parent
described below); and

 

 
•  Payment by Lattice of the premiums required to continue the executive’s health benefits coverage under COBRA

until the earlier of 12 months after the termination date or the date the executive receives substantially equivalent
coverage in connection with new employment.

Each executive’s entitlement to the severance payments and benefits above is conditioned upon the executive entering
into (and not subsequently revoking) a separation agreement and release of claims, and agreeing to certain non-
solicitation and non-disparagement covenants. Certain provisions of each executive’s employment agreement will be
modified by the letter agreements entered into with Lattice

and Parent, effective as of the closing date of the Merger, and described in the section below captioned “The Merger —
Interests of Lattice’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Arrangements with Parent.”

Mr. Downing
Mr. Downing is party to a severance letter agreement with Lattice which includes a “double trigger” change of control
severance provision. On November 3, 2016, Mr. Downing entered into an employment agreement with Lattice and Parent
that will become effective as of the Effective Time and supersede his severance letter agreement in its entirety, as
described in the section below captioned “The Merger — Interests of Lattice’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger — Arrangements with Parent.”

In the absence of the employment agreement, under Mr. Downing’s severance letter agreement, if a change in control of
Lattice occurs prior to August 31, 2017 and Mr. Downing’s employment is “involuntarily terminated” (as defined in the
severance letter agreement) either by Lattice or by him, in either case, within 24 months following such change in control,
then Mr. Downing will be entitled to receive the following payments and benefits:
 

 •  A lump sum cash payment equal to 1.0 times the sum of the executive’s then-current annual base salary and theexecutive’s target annual bonus amount;
 

 •  Full acceleration of the vesting of the executive’s then-outstanding compensatory equity awards; and
 

 
•  Payment by Lattice of the premiums required to continue the executive’s health benefits coverage under COBRA

until the earlier of 12 months after the termination date or the date the executive receives coverage in connection
with new employment.

Under the severance letter agreement, Mr. Downing’s entitlement to the severance payments and benefits above is
conditioned upon Mr. Downing entering into (and not subsequently revoking) a separation agreement and release of
claims.

Estimated Severance Payable to Executives
For an estimate of the value of the amounts that would be paid or become payable to each of Lattice’s named executive
officers, assuming, among other things, that the Merger was completed on January 23, 2017 and the employment of each
named executive officer was terminated either by Lattice without cause or by the named executive officer for good reason
immediately thereafter, see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-
Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.”

Arrangements with Parent
On November 3, 2016, each of Messrs. Billerbeck, Downing, Hawk and Milstead entered into letter agreements with
Parent and Lattice which will become effective as of the Effective Time. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and the
Merger does not occur for any reason, these letter agreements will be null, void and have no force and effect.

Letter Agreement with Mr. Billerbeck
Pursuant to Mr. Billerbeck’s letter agreement with Parent and Lattice, effective as of the closing date of the Merger:
 

 •  Mr. Billerbeck agreed to waive his right to terminate his employment for good reason under his employmentagreement as a result of, or in connection with, a diminution or adverse

 change to his duties, authority, title or responsibilities in connection with the Merger, including his right to receiveseverance payments and benefits pursuant to his employment agreement as a result thereof;
 

 
•  The definition of “good reason” under Mr. Billerbeck’s employment agreement was amended to provide that in

the event that, after the closing date of the Merger, Mr. Billerbeck ceases to be the principal executive officer of
Lattice without Mr. Billerbeck’s express written consent, such event will constitute good reason;

 

 

•  The amount of severance pay to which Mr. Billerbeck is entitled upon a termination of employment either by
Lattice without cause or by Mr. Billerbeck for good reason after the closing date of the Merger (for purposes of
this section, the “Cash Severance” as defined in the employment agreement) was amended to clarify that such
amount will be equal to the greater of (1) $2,000,000 or (2) two times the sum of his then annual base salary and
target bonus amount (with no proration), plus the amount of his monthly COBRA premiums until the earlier of
twelve months after the termination date or the date he commences receiving substantially equivalent coverage
in connection with new employment;

 

 
•  If Mr. Billerbeck remains continuously employed by Lattice through the second anniversary of the closing date of

the Merger, Lattice will pay Mr. Billerbeck an amount equal to the Cash Severance (as described above), in a
single lump sum on the 30th day following such date, subject to his execution of an effective and irrevocable
release of claims;

 

 
•  The definition of “compensatory equity” under Mr. Billerbeck’s employment agreement was amended to refer to

his outstanding Company Option and Company RSUs as of November 3, 2016, together with rights to receive
cash in accordance with the Merger Agreement with respect to such awards, which we refer to in this proxy
statement collectively as the “Compensatory Company Equity”;

 

 

•  Notwithstanding any provision in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, any outstanding and unvested Company
Options held by Mr. Billerbeck immediately prior to the closing date of the Merger (after taking into account any
vesting related to the satisfaction of any corporate performance goals) will not accelerate and become fully
vested at or prior to the effective time of the Merger, but instead will be treated as Unvested Company Options
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. If, prior to the second anniversary of the closing date of the
Merger, Mr. Billerbeck’s employment is terminated either by Lattice without cause or by Mr. Billerbeck for good
reason, then his then Unvested Company Options will become fully vested effective as of the date of such
termination, subject to Mr. Billerbeck’s satisfaction of the conditions to such acceleration of Compensatory
Company Equity pursuant to his employment agreement, including his execution of an effective and irrevocable
release of claims; and

 

 
•  Mr. Billerbeck will be eligible to receive grants of equity pursuant to an equity plan with respect to the successor

entity to Lattice as a result of the Merger on such terms to be approved by Parent, in consultation with
Mr. Billerbeck.

Letter Agreement with Mr. Hawk
Pursuant to Mr. Hawk’s letter agreement with Parent and Lattice, effective as of the closing date of the Merger:
 

 
•  Mr. Hawk agreed to waive his right to terminate his employment for good reason under his employment

agreement as a result of, or in connection with, a diminution or adverse change to his duties, authority, title or
responsibilities in connection with the Merger, including his right to receive severance payments and benefits

the “Cash Severance” as defined therein) was amended to clarify that such amount will be equal to the greater of
(1) $630,000 or (2) one times the sum of his then annual base salary and target bonus amount (with no

termination date or the date he commences receiving substantially equivalent coverage in connection with new
employment;

 

 
•  If Mr. Hawk remains continuously employed by Lattice through the first anniversary of the closing date of the

Merger, Lattice will pay Mr. Hawk an amount equal to the Cash Severance (as described above), in a single lump
sum on the 30th day following such date, subject to his execution of an effective and irrevocable release of
claims;

Letter Agreement with Mr. Milstead
Pursuant to Mr. Milstead’s letter agreement with Parent and Lattice, effective as of the closing date of the Merger:
 

 
•  Mr. Milstead agreed to waive his right to terminate his employment for good reason under his employment

agreement as a result of, or in connection with, a diminution or adverse change to his duties, authority, title or
responsibilities in connection with the Merger, including his right to receive severance payments and benefits
pursuant to his employment agreement as a result thereof;

 

 
•  The definition of “good reason” under Mr. Milstead’s employment agreement was amended to provide that no

change in duties or responsibilities after the closing date of the Merger will constitute good reason if, after such
change, the Board determines that Mr. Milstead will report to either the Lattice’s Chief Executive Officer or Chief
Operating Officer; and

 

 •  The definition of “compensatory equity” under Mr. Milstead’s employment agreement was amended to refer to theCompensatory Company Equity (as defined above).

Employment Agreement and Letter Agreement with Mr. Downing

date of the Merger, pursuant to which he will serve as the Corporate Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Lattice.

Mr. Downing’s employment agreement provides for a term commencing on the closing date of the Merger and ending on
the second anniversary thereof, and provides for an annual base salary of $275,000, subject to review and adjustment by
the Compensation Committee of the Board, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Committee”, at least annually.
In addition to his annual base

salary, commencing with the Lattice’s 2017 fiscal year, Mr. Downing will be eligible for an annual incentive bonus at an
initial target percentage amount of 50% of his base salary, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Target Bonus”,
and a maximum percentage amount of annual incentive bonus of 200% of the Target Bonus. The actual amount of
Mr. Downing’s annual incentive bonus will be based upon the achievement of specific milestones to be mutually agreed
upon by Mr. Downing and the Committee no later than 60 days after the start of each fiscal year.

If Mr. Downing’s employment is terminated either by the Company without cause or by Mr. Downing for good reason, in
either case, prior to the second anniversary of the closing date of the Merger, then Mr. Downing will immediately fully vest
in all of his Compensatory Company Equity (as defined above). Additionally, Lattice will pay Mr. Downing (1) an amount
equal to the sum of his then annual base salary and Target Bonus (with no pro ration), plus (2) the amount of his monthly
COBRA premiums until the earlier of twelve months after the termination date or the date he commences receiving
substantially equivalent coverage in connection with new employment.

Mr. Downing’s receipt of the severance payments and benefits pursuant to his employment agreement is subject to
Mr. Downing entering into (and not subsequently revoking) a separation agreement and release of claims, and agreeing to
certain non-solicitation and non-disparagement provisions that would be in effect for 12 months following his termination
date.

If the severance payments and benefits payable to Mr. Downing constitute “parachute payments” and would be subject to
the applicable excise tax under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then Mr. Downing’s severance and other
benefits shall be either (1) delivered in full; or (2) delivered to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such
benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the receipt by Mr. Downing on an after-tax basis of the
greatest amount of benefits.

In addition, Lattice and Parent entered into a letter agreement with Max Downing, pursuant to which, effective as of the
closing date of the Merger, Mr. Downing agreed to waive his right to terminate his employment for good reason as a result
of, or in connection with, a diminution or adverse change to his duties, authority, title or responsibilities in connection with
the Merger, including his right to receive severance payments and benefits pursuant to his employment agreement as a
result thereof.

Employee Benefits Following the Effective Time
The Merger Agreement provides that Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each Lattice employee
who continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries following the
Effective Time with certain compensation and benefits during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the first anniversary of the Effective Time, as described in the section captioned “The Merger Agreement — Employee
Benefits.”

Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code
None of the executive officers are entitled to any gross-up payments in respect of any excise taxes imposed on “excess
parachute payments” under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. Rather, if any of the amounts provided for under the
executive officer’s employment agreement or otherwise would constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and would be subject to the related excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, the
executive officer would receive either the full amount of such payments and benefits or such lesser amount that would
result in no portion of the payments and benefits being subject to such excise tax, whichever results in the greater net-
after-tax amount to such executive officer.

Table of Contents

Financing of the Merger
We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions will be
approximately $1.3 billion. In connection with the financing of the Merger, Parent has received the Equity Commitment
Letter from its parent, Canyon Bridge, pursuant to which Canyon Bridge has committed, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth Equity Commitment Letter, to purchase, directly or indirectly, immediately prior to the completion of the
Merger, additional equity interests of Parent for an aggregate purchase price equal to $1.3 billion. This amount will be used
solely for the purpose of allowing Parent or Merger Sub to (1) pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration,
(2) satisfy all of the outstanding indebtedness of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the extent required to be repaid
in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
and (3) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub at the completion of the Merger in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

As of the date of this proxy statement, Canyon Bridge has one limited partner, a wholly owned subsidiary of CVC, a large
Chinese investment fund. This CVC subsidiary has provided Canyon Bridge with an equity commitment sufficient to fund
Canyon Bridge’s obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter. A portion of that commitment was used to fund the
$58,750,000 that was placed by Parent in an escrow account located in the United States and held by Citibank, National
Association. Canyon Bridge also intends to use the proceeds from that commitment to fund its obligations under the Equity
Commitment Letter. Canyon Bridge expects that CVC’s indirect investment in Canyon Bridge will provide all of the funds
necessary for Parent to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and other expenses incurred by it in
connection with the Merger.

Canyon Bridge’s obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter are conditioned upon (1) the execution and delivery of
the Merger Agreement by Lattice, which has been met, and (2) the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by law, waiver of
Lattice’s and Parent’s mutual conditions to closing, and of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s conditions to closing (other than
those conditions that by their nature are only capable of being satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to the
concurrent satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by law, waiver of such conditions at the closing).

Although Canyon Bridge is a limited partnership, pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter, Parent has
agreed that no party other than Canyon Bridge will have any obligation to, or liability for failure to, provide the equity
financing, regardless of the party’s relation to Canyon Bridge, which includes Canyon Bridge, CBC Partners or Canyon
Bridge’s investors, including CVC. The Equity Commitment Letter provides that Parent, Merger Sub, and Lattice will have
no legal recourse or remedy against Canyon Bridge with respect to Parent’s rights pursuant to the Equity Commitment
Letter, except that Parent has a right to receive the equity financing in accordance with the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter. However, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Parent is not obligated to bring any
enforcement action against Canyon Bridge or any other financing source, including any financing source of Canyon Bridge,
to enforce Parent’s rights under the Equity Commitment Letter. Additionally, in the event that Canyon Bridge fails to provide
the equity financing or the amount necessary to consummate the Merger exceeds the $1.3 billion amount contemplated by
the Equity Commitment Letter, Parent and Merger Sub have no obligation to seek financing from any other source.

Furthermore, in the event that Lattice terminates the Merger Agreement when all of the mutual conditions to closing have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, each of which is capable of
being satisfied at the closing, and other than conditions that have not been satisfied due to an action by a governmental
entity in China) and all of the conditions to Parent and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, each of which is

capable of being satisfied at the closing), and Lattice has provided Parent with an irrevocable written notice that all such
conditions have been satisfied and stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger, but Parent and Merger Sub
fail to consummate the Merger within five business days of such written notice, Lattice’s sole remedy will be to seek from
Parent the reverse termination fee of $58,750,000. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger Agreement — Reverse Termination Fee Payable by Parent.”

The Equity Commitment Letter also provides that, subject to the prior written consent of Parent, and in accordance with the
terms of the Merger Agreement, Canyon Bridge may assign its rights, interests, obligations or a portion or all of its equity
commitment under the Equity Commitment Letter. However, no such assignment shall relieve Canyon Bridge or any
assigning investor of its obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter if any such assignee does not perform such
obligations. In addition, the Equity Commitment Letter may not be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified, and no provision of it may be waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by Parent and Canyon Bridge.

Closing and Effective Time
The closing of the Merger will take place at 12:00 p.m., Pacific time, at the offices of Jones Day, 1755 Embarcadero Road,
Palo Alto, California, as soon as practicable, but no later than five business days following the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions to closing of the Merger (described below under the caption “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the
Closing of the Merger”) (other than those conditions to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to satisfaction
or waiver, if permitted, of those conditions) or such other place, time, and date as will be agreed to in writing by Parent and
Lattice.

The Merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date and time as the Company and Parent may agree upon and as is set forth in that certificate
of merger.

Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who
properly demand appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under
Section 262 of the DGCL, which we refer to in this proxy statement as Section 262.”

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is
qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and
incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not
constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of
shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A person
having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank,
broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and
in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Lattice common stock through a bank,
broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or
the other nominee.

Under Section 262, holders of shares of common stock who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, (2) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the Effective Time, and (3) otherwise follow the
procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their

Table of Contents

shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of
common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together
with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court. Unless the Delaware
Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue
and compound quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period. However, pursuant to a recent
amendment to Section 262 of the DGCL, the surviving corporation may make a cash payment prior to the entry of a
judgment by the Delaware Court of Chancery to holders of shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights so no
interest will accrue on the prepaid amount. Interest will still accrue on the difference, if any, between the paid amount and
the fair value of the shares, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and on any interest accrued before the
payment, unless it was included in the payment.

Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that
appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Lattice’s
notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock who
wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so should review Annex C carefully.
Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of
appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the
Merger consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for
exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of common stock, Lattice believes that if a stockholder considers exercising
such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the
following:
 

 •  the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;
 

 •  the stockholder must deliver to Lattice a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreementat the Special Meeting;
 

 
•  the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the Effective

Time (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the Effective Time);
and

 

 
•  the stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a

determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation
is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.

Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Agreement,
a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the
Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote its shares.

Filing Written Demand
Any holder of shares of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Lattice, before the vote on the
adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be
submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the

Table of Contents

appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement. A holder of shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the
date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective Time. A
proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously
delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or
abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger
Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will, in and of itself,
constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal
must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A proxy or vote
against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder’s failure to make the written
demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting of Lattice’s
stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that
holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the
holder of record and must reasonably inform Lattice of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby
to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in connection with the Merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary
capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner,
and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand
should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more
joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the
record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record
owner or owners.

STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE
FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR
OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK,
BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A
BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK,
BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW
PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Lattice Semiconductor Corporation
111 SW Fifth Ave., Ste. 700

Portland, Oregon 97204
Attention: Corporate Secretary

Any holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration
offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to Lattice a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.
However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written
approval of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed
without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems just.

Table of Contents

Notice by the Surviving Corporation
If the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of
shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 and who has not voted in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal
Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of common
stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal
proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the
case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders
entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and
holders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the
fair value of the shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of common stock who desire to have their
shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of common
stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of common stock to file such a
petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with the requirements
for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement
setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect
to which Lattice has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving
Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt of the written request for
such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is
later. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such
person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the foregoing statements.
As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.

If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within twenty (20) days after such service to file
with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who
have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to
conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who
demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings.

Determination of Fair Value
After determining the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the “fair
value” of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon

the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into
account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the
Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the
Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware
discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of
value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors
involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the
court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other
facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that
such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only
to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court
of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or
susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant
to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the
fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any
manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Lattice believes that the Per Share Merger
Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by
the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a
determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Per Share Merger Consideration. Neither Lattice
nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Per Share Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal
rights, and each of Lattice and Parent reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of
Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of common stock is less than the Per Share Merger Consideration. If a petition for
appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings may be
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems
equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that
all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares
entitled to be appraised.

If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or
loses or successfully withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of common stock will be deemed
to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. A stockholder
will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120
days after the Effective Time or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s
demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.

Table of Contents

From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares
of common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends
or other distributions on the holder’s shares of common stock, if any, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to the
Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written
withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time
or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will
cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may
not be dismissed as to any stockholder who commenced the proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party
without the approval of the court.

Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult
legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following discussion is a summary of U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger generally applicable to U.S.
Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of common stock whose shares are converted into the
right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Code”, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code,
court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “IRS”,
and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change
or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of
common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment
purposes).

This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to
holders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
 

 

•  tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal
income tax laws, such as financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations) or
governmental organizations; S-corporations, partnerships or any other entities or arrangements treated as
partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes; insurance companies; mutual funds;
dealers in stocks and securities; traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting
for their securities; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; cooperatives; entities subject
to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

 

 •  tax consequences to holders holding the shares of common stock as part of a hedging, constructive sale orconversion, straddle or other risk reduction transaction;
 

 •  tax consequences to holders that received their shares of common stock in a compensatory transaction orpursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
 

 •  tax consequences to holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or the SurvivingCorporation following the Merger;
 

 •  tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
 

 •  tax consequences to holders who own or are deemed to own 5% or more of the outstanding shares of commonstock;

Table of Contents

 •  tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, ora branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;
 

 •  tax consequences to holders who are “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies”or “personal holding companies” for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 •  tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income;
 

 •  the non-income tax (such as the U.S. federal estate or gift tax) or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any;
 

 •  the U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any;
 

 •  any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences; or
 

 •  tax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the Merger and who properly demand appraisal of theirshares under Section 262 of the DGCL.

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will
generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding
shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger.

No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger
described below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would
ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.

THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL
ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S.
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE
LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION.

U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S. federal
income tax purposes:
 

 •  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 

 •  a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organizedin or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 •  an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 

 
•  a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or

more United States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, or (2) that has a valid election in
effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference,
if any, between the amount of cash received (determined before

the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered
pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for
the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s
holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on
capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is
neither a U.S. holder nor an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax
unless:
 

 

•  the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such
Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also
be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty); or

 

 
•  such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable

year of that disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty).

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Information reporting and backup withholding (at a rate of 28%) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant
to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer
identification number and certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute
or successor form) or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification of such holder’s foreign status on the
appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or (b) otherwise establishes an exemption from
backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the information reporting and
backup withholding rules.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
The Merger is subject to routine review by antitrust authorities to determine whether the proposed transaction is likely to
substantially lessen competition in any relevant market. Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed
until (1) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, which early termination was
granted on January 4, 2017, (2) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Austrian
Competition Act (Wettbewerbsgesetz) and/or the Austrian Cartel Act (Kartellgesetz), and (3) the clearance of the Merger
by CFIUS.

Table of Contents

CFIUS may determine that there are no national security concerns with the transaction, may impose mitigation terms to
resolve any national security concerns with the covered transaction, or may send a report to the President recommending
that the transaction be suspended or prohibited, or providing notice to the President that CFIUS cannot agree on a
recommendation relative to the covered transaction. CFIUS deliberations occur without transaction parties present, CFIUS
decisions are often based in part on classified or sensitive government information, and the substance of CFIUS national
security concerns are not generally shared with transaction parties, so transaction parties necessarily possess limited
knowledge of the areas of such concern. Lattice and Parent are not currently aware of either material national security
risks presented by the acquisition of Lattice or material national security threats presented by Parent as an acquirer.
However, CFIUS has historically closely reviewed transactions involving foreign acquisitions in the semiconductor industry
and those that could impact portions of the U.S. industrial base. Moreover, the report recently released by the President’s
Council of Advisors on Science & Technology (PCAST) on January 6, 2017 and other statements by policy makers
demonstrate that the U.S. government continues to view the potential loss of preeminence in the U.S. semiconductor
industry and Chinese acquisitions in the semiconductor space to be a national security concern. In addition, there can be
no assurance that the new U.S. Administration’s policy as to CFIUS matters, including matters involving acquirors with
Chinese financing sources such as Canyon Bridge, will be the same as in past administrations. Canyon Bridge has one
limited partner, a wholly owned subsidiary of CVC. Funding for the acquisition is expected to come from this subsidiary of
CVC. CVC is a large Chinese investment fund that is funded by its limited partners. CVC’s limited partners are Chinese
state-owned enterprises, and like all other Chinese state-owned enterprises, are ultimately owned by the Chinese
government. It is unclear whether the relationship between these Chinese entities and Parent will negatively impact
CFIUS’ review of the proposed Merger.

Clearance may not be obtained if CFIUS and the President elect to suspend or prohibit the transaction. In addition, Parent
may determine not to proceed with the Merger in the event that CFIUS imposes conditions that require Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company to take certain specific types of actions as described in the Merger Agreement and outlined in the ‘CFIUS’
section below.

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters
Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain transactions exceeding the applicable thresholds require
notification to the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, which we refer to in this proxy
as the “DOJ” and expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period before the transaction can be consummated,
unless an exemption applies. On January 4, 2017, the FTC granted early termination of the waiting period.

At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, even if the Merger does not require notification or has received
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as
it deems necessary under the applicable statutes, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate
existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, even if the Merger
does not require notification or has received termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such
action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the
Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate,
assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under
the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

CFIUS
The Merger is also conditioned on the clearance of the Merger by CFIUS. This CFIUS Approval takes the form of any of
the following: (1) a written notification from CFIUS that the Merger is not a covered

transaction and not subject to review under applicable law; (2) a written notification from CFIUS that it has concluded its
review and that there are no unresolved national security concerns in connection with the Merger; or (3) inaction, or a
decision not to take action, by the President. Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, which we
refer to in this proxy statement as the “Defense Production Act”, including the implementing regulations thereof codified at
31 C.F.R. Part 800, as well as related Executive Orders and regulations, authorize the President and CFIUS to review
transactions which could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person. Under the Defense Production Act, the
Secretary of the Treasury acts through CFIUS to coordinate review of certain covered transactions that are voluntarily
submitted to CFIUS or that are unilaterally reviewed by CFIUS. In general, CFIUS review of a covered transaction occurs
in an initial 30-day review period that may be extended by CFIUS for an additional 45-day investigation period. At the close
of its review or investigation, CFIUS may determine that there are no national security concerns with the transaction, may
impose mitigation terms to resolve any national security concerns with the covered transaction, or may send a report to the
President recommending that the transaction be suspended or prohibited, or providing notice to the President that CFIUS
cannot agree on a recommendation relative to the covered transaction. The President has 15 days under the Defense
Production Act to act on CFIUS’ report.

Lattice and Parent have filed a joint voluntary draft notice with CFIUS, have received comments from CFIUS staff on that
draft notice, and have filed a joint voluntary final notice, which has been accepted, commencing the CFIUS review process.

As noted above, CFIUS may impose conditions as a prerequisite for its clearance of the Merger. Except as otherwise
agreed by Lattice and Parent, Parent may determine not to proceed with the Merger should such conditions require
Parent, Merger Sub or Company to take actions that would reasonably be expected to (1) cause Parent’s control or
ownership of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to be passive or to otherwise restrict the ability of Parent to
control and operate the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries or their respective businesses, assets or operations by a
requirement to enter into a Special Security Agreement or similar arrangement, appoint a proxy or elect one or more
independent directors to the board of directors or governing body of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, except through a requirement to relinquish ownership rights permitted pursuant to the following
subsection, (2) require Parent to divest, exclusively license, transfer, hold separate, cease operating or otherwise
relinquish ownership rights with respect to one or more FPGA, complex programmable logic devices or wireless business
units, product lines, assets or technologies of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries whose total revenue (a) over
the 12 month period ended November 3, 2016 has exceeded, in the aggregate, $10.0 million, or (b) is anticipated to
exceed in the period ending 24 months after November 3, 2016 based on forecasts provided by the Company to Parent, in
the aggregate, $10.0 million, or (3) adversely affect in a material manner the operation or management of the Surviving
Corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ businesses, as conducted as of the date hereof, except through a requirement to
relinquish ownership rights permitted pursuant to the preceding subsection.

Austrian Competition Laws
The completion of the Merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Austrian
Competition Act (Wettbewerbsgesetz) and/or the Austrian Cartel Act (Kartellgesetz). On January 16, 2017, Parent notified
the Austrian Federal Competition Authority (Bundeswettbewerbsbehörde) of the proposed Merger. Unless extended or
earlier terminated, the applicable waiting period will expire on February 13, 2017. If neither the Austrian Federal
Competition Authority (Bundeswettbewerbsbehörde) nor the Austrian Federal Cartel Prosecutor (Bundeskartellanwalt)
apply to the Cartel Court (Kartellgericht) for an in-depth investigation within this waiting period, the Merger is deemed
legally cleared.

Other Regulatory Approvals
One or more governmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it
grants the necessary approvals and consents to the consummation of the Merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene
in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any of which actions could significantly
impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take
to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a
substantial period of time between the approval by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.

Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that
these regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory
clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including
the requirement to divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. These conditions or changes
could result in the conditions to the Merger not being satisfied.

Legal Proceedings Regarding the Merger
Lattice has amended its bylaws to provide that, unless Lattice consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum,
the Delaware Court of Chancery will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on
behalf of the Company, any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty, any action arising under the DGCL or the
Company’s corporate governance documents, or any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs
doctrine of the State of Delaware. In the event that the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction over
any such action, the sole and exclusive forum for such action shall be another state or federal court located within the
State of Delaware, in each case unless such court has dismissed a prior action by the same plaintiff asserting the same
claims due to lack of personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party named as a defendant therein.

On January 9, 2017, an alleged stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action captioned Parshall v. Lattice
Semiconductor Corp., Case No. 3:17-cv-00035, in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. The
defendants in the action are the Company, the members of the Board, CBC Partners, Parent and Merger Sub. The
complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
14a-9 promulgated thereunder by failing to disclose all material facts concerning the Merger in the draft proxy statement
filed on December 28, 2016. The complaint seeks an order: preliminarily and permanently enjoining consummation of the

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement
The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger
Agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by
reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into
this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety because
this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and
obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or
any other information contained in this proxy statement. Capitalized terms used in this section but not defined in
this proxy statement have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement
(1) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates, (2) were made solely for the benefit of
the parties to the Merger Agreement, and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental
information agreed to by Lattice, Parent and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger
Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from
those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential
matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by Lattice in connection with the Merger Agreement. In addition, the
representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual
risk between Lattice, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of
materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-party
beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Lattice, Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the
covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Lattice, Parent and Merger Sub,
because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the
Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice
to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information
regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding Lattice, Parent, Merger Sub
or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the
Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document
and in our filings with the SEC regarding Lattice and our business.

Effects of the Merger; Directors and Officers; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws
The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in accordance
with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, (1) Merger Sub will be merged with and into Lattice, with Lattice becoming a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, and (2) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease. From and after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will possess all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises
of Lattice and Merger Sub, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of Lattice and Merger Sub will become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

From and after the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation will consist of the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. From and after the Effective
Time, the officers of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time (other than as determined by Parent at any time prior
to the Effective Time) will be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their successors are
duly appointed and qualified. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Lattice as the Surviving Corporation
will be amended and restated to read as set forth in Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement and such amended and restated
certificate of incorporation will become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation, and the bylaws of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter amended.

The closing of the Merger will take place at 12:00 p.m., Pacific time, at the offices of Jones Day, 1755 Embarcadero Road,
Palo Alto, California, as soon as practicable, but no later than five business days following the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions to closing of the Merger (described below under the caption “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the

Merger Sub or a subsidiary of Lattice, will be canceled for no consideration. Each other outstanding share of common

interest and less any applicable withholding taxes). All shares converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration will automatically be canceled at the Effective Time.

Treatment of Equity-Based Awards

the per share exercise price of such Vested Company Option, which cash amount will be paid to the holders of such
Vested Company Options as soon as administratively practicable, but not later than ten business days, following the

equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares subject to such Unvested Company Option by (2) the
amount by which $8.30 exceeds the per share exercise price of such Unvested Company Option, which cash amount will
be payable subject to and in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such Unvested Company Option as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the Unvested Company Option holder’s continued service on each
applicable vesting date. As such, if the holder of an Unvested Company Option experiences a termination of employment
with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or a subsidiary of Parent, as applicable, after the Effective Time but prior to the date
on which that Unvested Company Option becomes fully vested, the holder will forfeit his or her right to receive any unpaid
cash amount in respect of that Unvested Company Option to the extent that the Unvested Company Option is forfeited
upon such termination pursuant to the terms of the Unvested Company Option, unless such he or she is entitled to
acceleration pursuant to terms of an agreement with Lattice.

All Company Stock Options which are not In-the-Money Company Options and any other Company Stock Options that are
not granted under any Company Stock Plan shall be canceled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time without the
payment of any consideration.

Treatment of Restricted Stock Units
At the Effective Time, each Unvested RSU will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax) equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(1) $8.30 by (2) the number of shares that remain subject to such Unvested RSU, which cash amount will vest and
become payable subject to and in accordance with the vesting and delivery schedule applicable to such Unvested RSU as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time subject to the Unvested RSU holder’s continued service on each applicable
vesting date. As such, if the holder of an Unvested RSU experiences a termination of employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or a subsidiary of Parent, as applicable, after the Effective Time but prior to the date on which that
Unvested RSU becomes fully vested, the holder will forfeit his or her right to receive any unpaid cash amount in respect of
that Unvested RSU to the extent that the Unvested RSU is forfeited upon such termination pursuant to the terms of the
Unvested RSU, unless such he or she is entitled to acceleration pursuant to terms of an agreement with Lattice.

At the Effective Time, each Vested RSU will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without
interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) $8.30 by
(2) the number of shares that remain subject to such Vested RSU, which cash amount will become payable subject to and
in accordance with the delivery schedule applicable to such Vested RSU as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan
With respect to the Company ESPP, no new offering period will commence, no Lattice employee or other person will be
permitted to begin participating in the Company ESPP, and no current participants will be permitted to increase elective
deferrals in respect of the current offering period. The offering period in effect on November 3, 2016 will terminate no later
than five days prior to the Effective Time, and amounts credited to the accounts of participants will be used to purchase
shares in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and such shares will be canceled and converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

Exchange and Payment Procedures
Prior to the closing of the Merger, Parent will designate a U.S.-based bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable
to Lattice, which we refer to as the “payment agent,” to make payments of the

Merger consideration to stockholders. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited with the
payment agent cash sufficient, together with amounts in the escrow fund (as defined below under “Deposit and Escrow
Agreement”) to be deposited with the payment agent at or prior to the effective time, to pay the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration to stockholders.

As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the payment agent will send to each holder of record of shares of
common stock a letter of transmittal and instructions advising stockholders how to surrender stock certificates and book-
entry shares in exchange for their portion of the Merger Consideration. Upon receipt of (1) surrendered certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry shares representing the shares of common stock, and (2) a signed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such shares will be
entitled to receive their portion of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor. The amount of any Merger Consideration
paid to the stockholders may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.

If any cash deposited with the payment agent is not claimed within one year following the Effective Time, such cash will be
returned to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of common stock who have not complied with the exchange
procedures in the Merger Agreement will thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration.

The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has been
stolen or destroyed. In the event any certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then before such stockholder will be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, such stockholder will have to make an affidavit of the loss, theft or
destruction, and if required by Parent, deliver a bond in such customary amount as Parent or the payment agent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate.

Representations and Warranties

Effective Time, Lattice has agreed not to, and to cause its affiliates and its and their respective representatives not to:
 

 •  solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any Takeover Proposal (as defined below) or anyinquiry, proposal or request for information that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal;
 

 
•  participate in discussions or negotiations with, furnish to any information to, or cooperate in any way with, any

person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub) with respect to any Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for information that may reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal;

if Lattice receives from any person a bona fide, written and unsolicited Takeover Proposal not arising from a material
breach of the Merger Agreement, then Lattice may provide confidential information to, and engage or participate in
discussions or negotiations with, such person regarding a Takeover Proposal if the Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel that such proposal is a Superior Proposal or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board’s
fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that (1) Lattice enters into, an acceptable confidentiality agreement with
such third party and promptly notifies Parent of its intention to do so, (2) if Lattice furnishes non-public information to the
third party which Parent has not yet received, it will furnish such information to Parent first or substantially
contemporaneously, (3) Lattice promptly (and in any event with 48 hours) informs Parent of its intention to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Takeover Proposal and provides Parent with the
identity of such person and provides with a copy of such Takeover Proposal (or, if it is not in written form, a written
description of Lattice’s understanding of the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal), and (4) Lattice
keeps Parent reasonably informed of the status of any Takeover Proposal.

For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement:

“Takeover Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal, offer or indication of interest to engage in, or that otherwise could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any transaction or series of related transactions resulting in:

(5) a recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or any other similar transaction or series of related transactions involving
Lattice or any of its subsidiaries, other than a wholly owned Lattice subsidiary.

consummated, would result in such entity owning, directly or indirectly, all of Lattice’s capital stock or all or substantially all
of Lattice’s consolidated assets, on terms that the Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal that the Board deems is appropriate in the exercise of its fiduciary duty, that is reasonably capable of being
consummated and is on terms that are more favorable to Lattice’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, after taking into account any changes to the terms of the Merger
Agreement offered by Parent in response to such acquisition proposal.

The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Adverse Recommendation Change
As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board has made the recommendation that the
holders of shares of common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement
provides that the Board will not change its recommendation that Lattice stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement except
as described below.

Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders, the Board may not (with any action described in the
following being referred to as an “adverse recommendation change”):
 

 •  withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, its recommendation that Latticestockholders adopt the Merger Agreement; or
 

 •  approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Takeover Proposal.

The Board may only effect an adverse board recommendation for an intervening event if the Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect an adverse recommendation change in
response to such intervening event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, and:
 

 
•  Lattice has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four business days in advance of making such adverse

recommendation change, which notice will include the facts underlying the Board determination that an
intervening event had occurred and the rationale and basis for making an adverse recommendation change as a
result of such intervening event;

 

 
•  prior to effecting such adverse recommendation change, Lattice has negotiated with Parent in good faith to make

such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so as to obviate the basis for such
adverse recommendation change; and

•  following any such negotiations, the Board determines, after taking into account any changes to the Merger

Agreement agreed to or proposed in writing by Parent, that the failure to effect an adverse recommendation
change in response to such intervening event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

In addition, the Board may only effect an adverse recommendation change in response to a Takeover Proposal received
after the date of the Merger Agreement that the Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal if:
 

 •  a material breach by Lattice of its non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement has not led to themaking of such Takeover Proposal;
 

 
•  the Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and

outside legal counsel) that the failure to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Superior Proposal
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;

 

 

•  Lattice has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four business days in advance of making such adverse
recommendation change, which notice will include the material terms of such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the entity making such Superior Proposal) and a copy of all the relevant proposed transaction
documents related thereto, and has provided new written notice to Parent with respect to any amendment to the
material terms of such Superior Proposal at least two business days of making such adverse recommendation
change;

 

 
•  prior to affecting such adverse recommendation change, Lattice has negotiated with Parent in good faith during

such four day (in the case of the original notice) or two day (in the case of a notice of an amendment) notice
period, to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that the Takeover
Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 

 
•  following any such negotiations, the Board determines, after taking into account any changes to the Merger

Agreement agreed to or proposed in writing by Parent, that the Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to approve or recommend such a Superior Proposal would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties.

For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement, an “intervening event” means a circumstance, event,
change, development, occurrence, state of facts, condition or effect on the business, results of operations or financial
condition of Lattice and its subsidiaries occurring or arising after the date of the Merger Agreement (other than and not
related to a Takeover Proposal) that was not known (or, if known, the material consequences of which were not known or
reasonably foreseeable) to the Board (assuming reasonable consultation with the executive officers of Lattice) on or prior
to the date of the Merger Agreement and that is material to Lattice and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided that any
fluctuation in the market price or trading volume of Lattice’s common stock will not constitute an intervening event, though
the underlying cause of such fluctuation may be taken into account.

Employee Benefits
Parent has agreed that for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or applicable subsidiary of Parent to provide each employee of
Lattice or its subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary of Parent
as of the Effective Time, each of whom we refer to in this proxy statement as a “Continuing Employee” with:
 

 •  at least the same level of base salary or hourly wage rate, as the case may be, that was provided to suchContinuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;

•  target annual cash performance bonus opportunities (but not equity or cash-settled equity-based incentive

opportunities) that are no less than the target annual cash performance bonus opportunities in effect with respect
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;

 

 
•  severance pay and benefits to any Continuing Employee who incurs a qualifying termination of employment at

any time during the one-year period following the Effective Time at levels that are no less favorable than the
levels of such severance pay and benefits as in effect under the applicable Lattice benefit plans immediately prior
to the Effective Time; and

 

 •  other employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such ContinuingEmployee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or applicable subsidiary of Parent to,
provide that periods of service with Lattice and its subsidiaries and their respective predecessor entities will be credited for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of benefits under any employee benefit plans (other than any defined benefit
pension, retiree welfare benefit or equity compensation plans) in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to participate
following the Effective Time, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “Post-Closing Plans”, in each case, to the
same extent such service was recognized under a comparable Lattice benefit plan prior to the Effective Time (except to the
extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service).

With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that is a health or welfare benefit plan which replaces coverage under a comparable
Lattice benefit plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent will,
and will cause its affiliates to (1) waive all limitations as to preexisting condition exclusions and all waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Continuing Employee to the extent waived or
satisfied under the comparable Lattice benefit plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (2) provide that Continuing Employees will be immediately eligible to participate in any such Post-
Closing Plan, without any waiting period, to the extent such Continuing Employee was eligible to participate in the
comparable Lattice benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (3) credit each Continuing Employee for any
applicable amounts paid or eligible expenses incurred (whether in the nature of co-payments or coinsurance amounts,
amounts applied toward deductibles or other out-of-pocket expenses) by such Continuing Employee (and his or her
covered dependents) under the terms of the Lattice benefit plan toward satisfying any applicable deductible, copayment or
out-of-pocket requirements under the applicable Post-Closing Plan that replaces such Lattice benefit plan for the plan year
in which the Effective Time occurs.

With respect to any accrued but unused vacation and paid time off to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant
to the vacation and paid time off policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary of Parent to, assume the liability for such accrued
vacation and paid time off and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued vacation and paid time off in
accordance with the practice and policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary of Parent.

The Merger Agreement does not confer upon any employee or other service provider of Lattice or its subsidiaries any right
to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary of Parent, or limit the rights of
Parent or its affiliates to terminate the employment or service of any employee or other service provider of Lattice or its
subsidiaries in accordance with applicable law.

Efforts to Close the Merger

their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in the most expeditious manner practicable, including efforts needed
to obtain all required consents from third parties, and to obtain all necessary regulatory and governmental approvals,
including obtaining HSR antitrust clearance, which clearance was obtained on January 4, 2017, and the CFIUS Approval.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with obtaining HSR antitrust clearance or the CFIUS Approval, Lattice, Parent
and Merger Sub shall not be required to take actions or submit to restrictions other than certain specified actions and
restrictions, to the extent that such actions, restrictions or conditions, considered collectively, would reasonably be
expected to (1) cause Parent’s control of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to be passive or otherwise restrict
Parent’s ability to control and operate the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries by a requirement to enter into a
special security arrangement, appoint a proxy or elect one or more independent directors to the governing body of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries, (2) require Parent to relinquish ownership rights with
respect to certain business units, product lines or technologies with a total revenue of over $10 million in the prior 12
month period or that is expected to have a total revenue of over $10 million in the 24 months after the date of the Merger
Agreement, or (3) adversely affect in a material manner the operation or management of the Surviving Corporation’s and
its subsidiaries’ businesses, as conducted as of the date of the Merger Agreement.

Deposit and Escrow Agreement

Citibank, National Association providing for the establishment and administration of the escrow fund, as collateral and
security for the payment of the reverse termination fee payable by Parent in accordance with the Merger Agreement and
the escrow agreement. On November 3, 2016, Parent deposited in escrow $58,750,000.

Indemnification and Insurance
The Merger Agreement provides that the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) honor all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
of each former and present director or officer of Lattice or any of its subsidiaries, as provided in Lattice’s or its subsidiaries’
organizational documents or in any contract with Lattice or its subsidiaries, as in effect on the date of the Merger
Agreement, for any acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time.

In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that, during the six year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent will
cause to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies in effect as
of the Effective Time by Lattice and its subsidiaries on terms and conditions not less favorable to the insured parties than
the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Lattice with respect to claims arising from
facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event will Parent be
required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by
Lattice for such insurance policy in effect on July 1, 2016, and if the premium for that insurance coverage would exceed
that amount Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain the greatest coverage available for a
cost equal to that amount.

terminated:
 

 

•  by Lattice if Parent or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform any of its respective representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement, other than its obligations to seek

corresponding conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement are not satisfied; or

 

 

•  by Lattice if (1) the Merger was not completed when it was required to have been under the terms of the Merger
Agreement even thought all of the mutual conditions to closing have been satisfied (other than those conditions

other than conditions that have not been satisfied due to an action by a governmental entity in China) and all of

to Lattice, but the funds placed into the escrow account by Parent as collateral and security for payment of the reverse
termination fee will be frozen in escrow and any damages payable to Lattice in connection with such action shall not
exceed such amount, even in the case of willful breach or fraud by Parent or Merger Sub.

Specific Performance
In the event of a breach or threatened breach of any covenant or obligation in the Merger Agreement, subject to the
immediately following paragraph, the non-breaching party will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement.

Parent, Lattice will not be permitted to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief or any other
remedy under the Merger Agreement following the payment by Parent of the reverse termination fee.

Fees and Expenses
Except for the termination fee payable to Lattice by Parent and the reverse termination fee payable to Parent by Lattice,
whether or not the Merger is completed, Lattice, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, are
each responsible for all of their respective costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Amendment
The Merger Agreement may be amended in writing signed by each of Lattice, Parent and Merger Sub at any time before or
after adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders. However, after adoption of the Merger Agreement by
stockholders, no amendment that by law requires further approval by such stockholders may be made without such
approval.

Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
The Merger Agreement is governed by Delaware law. Any action seeking an order of specific performance or other
equitable relief of Parent’s obligations under the Merger Agreement or taken by Lattice against Parent or Merger Sub
seeking damages for fraud or willful breach shall be resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International
Arbitration Centre. All other actions shall be submitted to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware.

and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the “DGCL”).

Merger is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (2) adopted resolutions approving and
declaring the advisability of this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and
(3) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

interests of Merger Sub and Parent, its sole stockholder, (2) adopted resolutions approving and declaring the advisability of
this Agreement and the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby, and (3) resolved to recommend that Parent,
as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, adopt this Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

F. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Canyon Bridge Fund I, LP, a Delaware limited
partnership (the “Equity Investor”), has entered into an equity financing commitment letter in favor of Parent (such letter,
together with all exhibits, annexes, schedules and attachments thereto, in each case as amended or otherwise modified in
accordance with this Agreement, “Equity Commitment Letter”), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions
contained therein, the Equity Investor has committed to invest in Parent the amounts set forth therein.

agreements herein and intending to be legally bound, the Parties agree as follows:

Section 1.02 Closing. Subject to the provisions of ARTICLE VII, the closing (the “Closing”) of the Merger (a) will take
place at 12:00 p.m., Pacific Time, at the offices of Jones Day, 1755 Embarcadero Road, Palo Alto, California, as soon as
practicable (but in no event later than five Business Days after all of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII (other than
conditions which by their terms are required to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions) shall have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the Party entitled to the benefit of the
same, or (b) will occur at such other place, time and date as will be agreed in writing between the Company and Parent
(the date upon which the Closing occurs, the “Closing Date”).

Section 1.03 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Company will file a
certificate of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger will become effective upon
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date and time as
the Company and Parent may agree upon and as is set forth in such Certificate of Merger (such time, the “Effective Time”).

Section 1.04 Effect. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger will be as provided in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub will
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.05 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

(a) At the Effective Time, the Company Charter will, by virtue of or in connection with the Merger, be amended
and restated in its entirety to read as set forth in Exhibit A and, as so amended, will be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter further amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the
Company Bylaws will be amended and restated in their entirety to be the same as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation will be “Lattice Semiconductor
Corporation” and, as so amended, will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.06 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. Unless Parent, in its sole discretion, determines
otherwise, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

ARTICLE II
EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

Section 2.01 Effect on Capital Stock . At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any Party or the holders of any Shares or shares of common stock of Merger Sub:

(a) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (such shares, collectively, the “Shares”) that is held by the

Table of Contents

Company as treasury stock and each Share that is owned by a Company Subsidiary, Parent or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, “Excluded Shares”) will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled
and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) Conversion of Shares. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive $8.30 in cash (the “Merger
Consideration”). All such Shares, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and
will cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
such Shares (“Certificates”) and each holder of such Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
not represented by Certificates (“Book-Entry Shares”) will thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, to be paid, without interest, in consideration therefor upon surrender
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.02(b) (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, Section 2.02(h)). As and to the extent provided in Section 2.06, the right of any holder of Shares to receive the
Merger Consideration will be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding under applicable Tax Law.

(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of common stock of Merger Sub will be deemed for all purposes to
represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

Section 2.02 Payment of Merger Consideration; Surrender of Shares.

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a U.S.-based bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the purpose of exchanging Shares for the
Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, (i) in accordance with Section 6.14, Parent and the Company will
cause the Escrow Agent to release all funds held in the Escrow Account to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of Shares, and (ii) Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Shares, cash in an amount sufficient, after taking into account the amount deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to
Section 2.02(a)(i), to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.01(b). All
such cash deposited with the Paying Agent (including cash from the Escrow Fund deposited with the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 6.14) is hereinafter referred to as the “Payment Fund”. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been
perfected as described in Section 2.03 shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation upon demand; provided that the
Parties acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required under
this Section 2.02 or otherwise to deposit with the Paying Agent any cash to pay Merger Consideration with respect to
Shares as to which its holder has purported to deliver a notice or demand of appraisal that has not been withdrawn prior to
the Closing Date.

(b) Payment Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Paying Agent
to mail to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(b): (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (including a provision confirming that
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the

Table of Contents

surrender of such holder’s Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration
issuable and payable in respect thereof pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Exchange of any Book-Entry Shares will be
effected in accordance with the Paying Agent’s customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.
Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter
of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the holder of such
Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange for such properly surrendered Shares an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the number of Shares represented by such holder’s properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
and (ii) the Merger Consideration. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry
Share shall be properly transferred and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax is not applicable.

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Share
represented by a Certificate and each Book-Entry Share (other than Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares) shall be
deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Article II, without any interest thereon, and subject to deduction for any required deduction for withholding
Taxes pursuant to Section 2.06. All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article II will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(d) Stock Transfer Books. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If after the Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for
transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

(e) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest or other income
received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares after the one year anniversary of the
Closing Date will be delivered to Parent and any holder of Shares who has not theretofore complied with this Article II will
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to
Tax or other applicable Law.

(f) No Liability. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or any other Person will
be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been
exchanged prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(g) Investment of Payment Fund. The Payment Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent;
provided, however, that any such investments shall be in (i) short-term obligations of the United States (or any
instrumentality or agency thereof) with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States (or any
instrumentality or agency thereof) and backed by the full

faith and credit of the United States, (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A1 or P1 or better by Moody’s Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, with maturities of no more than six months, or (iii) certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $2.0 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) with maturities of no more
than six months. No gain or loss thereon will affect the amounts payable to the holders of Shares following completion of
the Merger pursuant to this Agreement. Any and all interest and other income earned on the Payment Fund will promptly
be paid to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent as directed by Parent. No investment of the Payment Fund shall relieve Parent or
the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by this Article II, and following any losses from any such
investment that diminishes the Payment Fund below the level required for the Paying Agent to make the payments
required to be made by it pursuant to this Article II, Parent shall promptly provide or cause to be provided additional cash
funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Company’s stockholders at the Effective Time in the amount necessary to
ensure the Payment Fund is sufficient for the Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated to be made by it pursuant
to this Article II, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund.

(h) Lost or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the Merger Consideration, except that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of
such Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such
customary amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 2.03 Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
(“Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such
holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holder’s right to appraisal under the
DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect
or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into and
become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to
appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.01(b).
The Company will notify Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares,
withdrawals of such demands and any other written instruments received by the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL, and Parent will have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
settle or offer to settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

Section 2.04 Company Stock Plans.

(a) Vested In-the-Money Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Shares (each, a
“Company Stock Option”) granted under any Company Stock Plan with an exercise price per Share less than the Merger
Consideration (an “In-the-Money Company Stock Option”) that is vested (after taking into account (i) the measurement of
any corporate performance goals that are required to be measured at or prior to the Effective Time under the terms of such
outstanding In-the-Money Company Stock Options as set forth in Section 2.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and
(ii) any accelerated vesting that is required to occur at or prior to the Effective Time under the terms of

such outstanding In-the-Money Company Stock Option) and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such
vested outstanding In-the-Money Company Stock Options, the “Vested Company Options”) shall, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder of such Vested Company Option, be canceled and converted into the right of such
holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
Share of such Vested Company Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Vested Company Option.

(b) Unvested In-the-Money Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding In-the-Money Company Stock
Option that is not a Vested Company Option shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder of such In-
the-Money Company Stock Option, be canceled and converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving
Corporation an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the
product of (i) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such unvested and outstanding
In-the-Money Company Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such unvested and outstanding In-the-
Money Company Stock Option, which cash amount will be payable by the Surviving Corporation subject to and in
accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such unvested In-the-Money Company Stock Option as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Other Company Stock Options. All Company Stock Options which are not In-the-Money Company Stock
Options and any other Company Stock Options that are not granted under any Company Stock Plan shall be canceled as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for no consideration.

(d) Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units (each, a “Company RSU”)
granted under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding and unvested (after taking into account any accelerated
vesting that is required to occur at or prior to the Effective Time under the terms of such Company RSU) as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (such unvested Company RSU, an “Unvested RSU”) shall, automatically and without any action
on the part of any holder of such Unvested RSU, be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the
product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of Shares that remain subject to such Unvested RSU, which
cash amount will vest and become payable by the Surviving Corporation subject to and in accordance with the vesting
schedule and issuance or delivery schedule applicable to such Unvested RSU as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Each Company RSU granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding and vested (after taking into
account any accelerated vesting that is required to occur at or prior to the Effective Time under the terms of such Company
RSU) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (such vested Company RSU, a “Vested RSU”) shall, automatically and
without any action on the part of any holder of such Vested RSU, be canceled and converted into the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax)
equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of Shares that remain subject to such Vested RSU,
which cash amount will become payable by the Surviving Corporation subject to and in accordance with the issuance or
delivery schedule applicable to such Vested RSU as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) Payments. To the extent necessary, Parent shall provide to the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary to
fulfill the obligations (i) under Section 2.04(a) no later than the Effective Time and (ii) under Section 2.04(b) and
Section 2.04(d) on or as soon as reasonably practicable following the applicable vesting or issuance or delivery date. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid any amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.04(a) as soon
as administratively practicable, but no later than ten Business Days, following the Effective Time. All payments in respect
of Company Stock Options and Company RSUs will be treated as a right to receive a series of

separate payments and, accordingly, each such payment will be considered a separate and distinct payment for purposes
of Section 409A of the Code (including for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)). All payments in
respect of Company Stock Options and Company RSUs will, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, only be due and
payable in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A) or in a manner exempt from the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code in reliance upon Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4).

(f) Treatment of Company Stock Plans; Other Corporate Actions. The Company Board or a committee thereof
shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are reasonably necessary to terminate the Company Stock Plans,
effective as of, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, none of Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be required to issue Shares
or other share capital of the Company or the Surviving Corporation to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of a
Company Stock Option or Company RSU. Without liming the foregoing, the Company agrees to take any and all actions
necessary to approve and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04, including making any determinations or
resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof.

Section 2.05 Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan. With respect to the Company’s 2012 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), (a) no new offering period will commence after the date of this Agreement and, to the extent
not already provided for under the terms of the ESPP as of the date of this Agreement, no Company Employees or other
persons will be permitted to begin participating in the ESPP, and no participants will be permitted to increase elective
deferrals in respect of the current offering period under the ESPP, in each case after the date of this Agreement, (b) any
offering period under the ESPP that is in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement will terminate no later than
five days prior to the Effective Time, and amounts credited to the accounts of participants will be used to purchase Shares
in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, and (c) such Shares will be treated as other outstanding Shares in accordance
with Section 2.01(b) of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each fractional Share held by any participant under the
ESPP (if any) will be canceled and extinguished at the Effective Time, and be converted into the right to receive a
commensurate fractional portion of the Merger Consideration, without interest, payable to the holder of each such
fractional Share.

Section 2.06 Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amount otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of Law related to Taxes. If the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, so withholds amounts and remits such amounts to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.07 Adjustments. The Merger Consideration will be automatically adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Shares), cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Shares occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 2.07 will be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction
otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

information that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, contact the Person that has made such

(e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.02(d) to the contrary, but subject to Section 5.02(g), if at any time prior
to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval an Intervening Event occurs or arises, the Company Board may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change described in clause (A) of the definition thereof if the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Company Board’s fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.02(a) or Section 5.02(d) to the contrary, but subject to Section 5.02(g),

Proposal after the date of this Agreement, (ii) a material breach by the Company of this Section 5.02 has not led to the
making of such Takeover Proposal, and (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside counsel, that (A) such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to
all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent and (B) the failure to approve or
recommend such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties to the Company’s
stockholders under applicable Law, then the Company Board may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(ii) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board may not effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.02(f) unless:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four Business Days in advance
(the “Notice Period”), of its intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal, or Intervening Event, as
the case may be, which notice shall specify, in reasonable detail, (A) in the case of any action being taken in connection
with a Superior Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person
making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of any proposed definitive
Contract(s) with respect to such Superior Proposal (the “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”), or (B) in the case of any
action being taken in connection with an Intervening Event, the facts underlying the Company Board’s determination that
an Intervening Event has occurred and the rationale and basis for making an Adverse Recommendation Change as a
result of such Intervening Event;

(ii) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal or to obviate
the basis for an Adverse Recommendation Change; and

(iii) following any negotiation described in Section 5.02(g)(ii), the Company Board determines, after taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to or proposed in writing by Parent, that (A) in the case of
any action being taken in connection with a Takeover Proposal, such Takeover Proposal (taking into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement agreed to or proposed in writing by Parent) continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and
that the failure to approve or recommend such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s
fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Law or (B) in the case of any action being taken in
connection with an Intervening Event, the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of the
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties to the Company’s stockholders under
applicable Law.

originally scheduled to expire and (2) the second Business Day following the delivery of the notice setting forth such

Company’s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure

will the Company Board make an Adverse Recommendation Change except as permitted by Section 5.02(f).

Change is in effect. The Company may, without the prior consent of Parent, make one or more successive postponements

Statement required under applicable Law is timely provided to the Company’s stockholders within a reasonable amount of
time, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with its outside counsel), in advance of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, (ii) if required by applicable Law or a request from the SEC or its staff or (iii) if, on a date
for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of Shares to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present; provided

written consent of Parent. All other postponements or adjournments shall require the prior written consent of Parent.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company agrees that (i) its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.01(b)
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any
other Person of any Takeover Proposal or the occurrence of an Intervening Event and (ii) unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company’s obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting will not be affected by the occurrence of any Adverse Recommendation Change.

of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy pursuant to, the Equity Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver would, or would reasonably
be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing, (ii) impose new or additional (or adversely modifies any
existing) conditions to the receipt of the Financing, (iii) adversely affect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the
other parties to the Equity Commitment Letter, or (iv) impede, prevent or materially delay the Closing or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall have the right to permit the Equity Investor or any other party to
the Equity Commitment Letter to assign its or their commitments thereunder to other equity financing sources, to the extent
consistent with the prior sentence and to the extent that this would not reasonably be expected to impede, delay, prevent
or adversely impact receipt of the HSR Antitrust Clearance, the CFIUS Approval, or any other Regulatory Filing or
necessary approval or clearance under Section 6.04(a)(ii). Any reference in this Agreement to the “Financing” will include
the financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter as amended or modified in compliance with this Section 6.03
and “Equity Commitment Letter” will include such document as amended or modified in compliance with this Section 6.03.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to arrange and
obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Equity Commitment Letter, including using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to
the conditions thereof, (ii) satisfy all conditions to funding that are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Equity
Commitment Letter, (iii) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, and (iv) comply with its obligations pursuant
to the Equity Commitment Letter. Parent will notify the Company as soon as reasonably practicable if, at any time prior to
the Closing Date, (i) the Equity Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii) the Equity Investor or
any other equity financing source notifies Parent that it no longer intends to provide financing to Parent in accordance with
the Equity Commitment Letter, or (iii) for any reason Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain the
Financing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 6.03
will require, and in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require,
either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) bring any enforcement action against the Equity Investor or any other financing source
(including any financing source of the Equity Investor) to enforce its rights pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter or
(ii) seek the Financing from any source other than the Equity Investor or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by
the Equity Commitment Letter.

(d) Prior to the Closing, and without limiting its obligations pursuant to Section 6.04, the Company shall, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable efforts to

cause its and their respective Representatives to, in each case, provide to Parent all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the arrangement and consummation of the Financing (provided that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries),
including by participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows and due diligence sessions at
reasonable times and with reasonable advance notice, and furnishing Parent and the Equity Investor as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the delivery of a request therefor to the Company by Parent (which notice shall state with
specificity the information requested) for such financial and other information regarding the Company as is reasonably
available to the Company at such time and is customarily provided in connection with such financings; it being understood
that the Company shall have satisfied its obligations if the Company shall have used its reasonable efforts to comply with
such obligations whether or not any applicable deliverables are actually obtained or provided. The foregoing
notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit the taking
of any action pursuant to this Section 6.03 that would: (i) require the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any directors
of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the
Financing or execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any change or modification
of any existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement; (ii) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement
to be breached by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries; (iii) require the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other expense, liability or obligation in connection with
the Financing prior to the Closing or have any obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under any
agreement, certificate, document or instrument be effective prior to the Closing; (iv) cause any director, officer or employee
or stockholder of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to incur any personal liability; (v) conflict with any applicable
Laws or the Company Charter, Company Bylaws or the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary;
(vi) reasonably be expected to result in a material violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time,
or both) under, any Material Contract; (vii) prepare any financial statements or information that are not available to it and
prepared in the ordinary course of its financial reporting practice; or (viii) require the Company or any Company Subsidiary
to enter into any instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the occurrence of the Closing or that would be effective if
the Closing does not occur. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or Company Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in connection with such cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, any action taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to
this Section 6.03 and any information used in connection therewith, except to the extent such losses or liabilities arose out
of or resulted from (i) information provided in writing by or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of
its or their respective Representatives or (ii) the gross negligence, fraud, bad faith or Willful Breach by the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any of its or their respective Representatives.

(e) If requested by Parent, the Company shall provide reasonable cooperation to Parent and Merger Sub in
arranging for, at the Closing, the termination or redemption of (i) the Indebtedness of the Company set forth in
Section 6.03(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter and (ii) any other Indebtedness of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries, together with the procurement of customary payoff letters in connection therewith; provided that in no event
shall this Section 6.03(e) require the Company to cause any such Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be
terminated prior to the Effective Time.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this
Section 6.03 represent the sole obligation of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of

Section 6.04 Required Actions.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties agrees to use reasonable

Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) obtain all required consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, including as required under any Material Contract or Material Lease and (ii) obtain all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities,

waiver from, or to avoid any Action by, any Governmental Entity, including making the Regulatory Filings and obtaining the
HSR Antitrust Clearance and the CFIUS Approval.

(b) In connection with, and without limiting, the efforts referenced in Section 6.04(a), Parent or Merger Sub (and
their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company (and the Company Subsidiaries, if applicable),
on the other hand, shall (i) prepare and file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report
Form relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as required by the HSR Act as soon as

Agreement), (ii) jointly prepare and pre-file with CFIUS a draft joint voluntary notice pursuant to the DPA relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
and then as soon as reasonably practicable after CFIUS notification that the draft joint voluntary notice meets all
requirements of 31 C.F.R. § 800.402 of the regulations, jointly file with CFIUS a joint voluntary notice pursuant to the DPA
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) promptly determine whether any other filings are
required to be made with, and whether any other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be
obtained from, any Governmental Entity under any other applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, and if so, to prepare and file any such filings and to seek any such other consents, approvals, permits or
authorizations (the filings described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) collectively, “Regulatory Filings”).

(c) In connection with, and without limiting, the efforts referenced in Section 6.04(a) or the obligations of the
Parties under Section 6.04(b), each of Parent and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and not
prohibited by the applicable Governmental Entity, (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other Parties in the making of
Regulatory Filings (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, providing copies, or portions thereof, of all such
documents to the non-filing Parties prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
in connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation, request or other inquiry of any Governmental
Entity under any applicable Law with respect to any Regulatory Filing, (ii) supply the other Parties with any information and
reasonable assistance that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with the making of any Regulatory
Filing within a reasonable period, (iii) supply, within an allowed reasonable period, any additional or supplemental

use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the HSR Antitrust Clearance
and the CFIUS Approval, in each case as soon as practicable, and to avoid any impediment to the consummation of the
Merger under any applicable Law, including using reasonable best efforts to take all such action as may be necessary to

resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ, CFIUS or any other Governmental Entity or Person may assert with
respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the
Company (and the Company Subsidiaries, if applicable), on the other hand, shall, to the extent practicable and unless
prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity, promptly inform the other Parties of any material
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
connection with any Regulatory Filings or investigations with, by or before any Governmental Entity relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any Actions initiated by a private party. If any Party or
Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to a Regulatory Filing, then such Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make, or
cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably practicable and unless prohibited by applicable
Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity, the Parties will (i) give each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings
with any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) give each other an
opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, (iii) keep the other Parties apprised with respect to any material
communications with any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby,

regulatory or competitive argument or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Entity, (v) provide
each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the views of
the other with respect to, all material written communications (including applications, analyses, presentations, memoranda,

hereby, and (vi) provide each other (or counsel of each Party, as appropriate) with copies of all material written
communications to or from any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby.
Any such disclosures, rights to participate or provisions of information by one Party to the other may be made on a
counsel-only basis if allowed or required under applicable Law.

(e) In connection with, and without limiting, the efforts referenced in Section 6.04(a) or the obligations of the
Parties under Section 6.04(b), except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including Section 6.04(f)), each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, to take or commit to take) all steps:
(i) necessary to obtain all consents, approvals or nonactions required to be obtained in connection with the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) necessary to avoid or eliminate
impediments under any Law that may be asserted by the FTC, the DOJ, CFIUS or any other Governmental Entity or other
Person with respect to the Merger and any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, in each case so as to
enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and, in any event, prior to the
Outside Date, and, if necessary, will participate in any Action in order to defend against any action by any Governmental
Entity or private party to prevent or enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to (and the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent)

condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Merger

assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in any manner, (iii) agree to any Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence mitigation
arrangement, including any Special Security Agreement, National Security Agreement or other mitigation arrangement, or

Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates; provided, however, that
to the extent necessary to obtain the HSR Antitrust Clearance or the CFIUS Approval, the Parties shall (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to) take or agree to take the actions set forth in Section 6.04(f) of the Company
Disclosure Letter and take or agree to take other actions or accept other restrictions or conditions if, but only if, such
actions, restrictions or conditions, considered collectively, would not reasonably be expected to (i) cause Parent’s control
or ownership of the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to be passive or to otherwise restrict the ability of
Parent to control and operate the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries or their respective businesses,
assets or operations by a requirement to enter into a Special Security Agreement or similar arrangement, appoint a proxy
or elect one or more independent directors to the board of directors or governing body of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, except through a requirement to relinquish ownership rights permitted
pursuant to the following subsection; (ii) require Parent to divest, exclusively license, transfer, hold separate, cease
operating or otherwise relinquish ownership rights with respect to one or more FPGA, CPLD or wireless business units,
product lines, assets or technologies of the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries whose total revenue
(A) over the 12 month period ended the date of this Agreement has exceeded, in the aggregate, $10.0 million, or (B) is
anticipated to exceed in the period ending 24 months after the date of this Agreement based on forecasts provided by the
Company to Parent, in the aggregate, $10.0 million or (iii) adversely affect in a material manner the operation or
management of the Surviving Corporation’s and the Company Subsidiaries’ businesses, as conducted as of the date
hereof, except through a requirement to relinquish ownership rights permitted pursuant to the preceding subsection.

(g) Parent shall adopt this Agreement as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub and provide duly executed proof of
such adoption to the Company immediately following the execution of this Agreement.

Section 6.05 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of each former
and present director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each, together with such person’s heirs,
executors or administrators, a “Company Indemnified Party”) as provided in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws
(and comparable governing documents of the Company Subsidiaries) or in any Contract with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (which Contracts are set forth in Section 3.15(b)(vi) of the Company Disclosure Letter), in each case
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time.

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will cause to be maintained in effect the coverage
provided by the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies in effect as of the Effective Time by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries on terms and conditions not less favorable to the insured Persons than the directors’ and officers’
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts, events, acts or
omissions that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event will Parent be required to pay an annual
premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company for such
insurance policy in effect on July 1, 2016 (the “Maximum Amount”); provided,

Table of Contents

however, that if such insurance can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Amount, Parent will
obtain the most advantageous policy of directors’ and officers’ insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may in its discretion purchase, and Parent may in its discretion
purchase if the Company declines to do so, a “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy covering the six-year
period from and after the Effective Time on terms and conditions not less favorable to the insured Persons than the
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts,
events, acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective Time, provided that without Parent’s consent, the cost of
such “tail” policy will not exceed the Maximum Amount.

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then,
and in each such case, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.05. The provisions of this Section 6.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
indemnified or insured party (including the Company Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives
and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise.

Section 6.06 Fees and Expenses. Except as provided in Section 8.02(b) and Section 8.02(c), all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions are consummated.

Section 6.07 Transaction Litigation. The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within
two Business Days of being served, notify Parent in writing of and give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense
or settlement of, any Action against the Company or its Representatives by a holder of securities of the Company relating
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and no such settlement will be agreed to without the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without limiting in
any way the Company’s obligations under Section 6.04, the Company will cooperate, and will cause the Company
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to cooperate, in the defense against such Action.

Section 6.08 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all such steps as may be required
to cause any dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Shares) resulting from the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who will be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.09 Public Announcements. The Parties agree that the initial press release(s) to be issued with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be in a form mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, each of
Parent and the Company agree that no public release, announcement, press conference, conference call with investors or
analysts or other public statement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein (or that could
reasonably be expected to relate to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein) will be issued, held or made
by any Party or its Subsidiaries without prior consultation with and the prior consent of the other Party, except as may be
required by applicable Law, in which case the Party required to make the

release or announcement will use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and the relevant Party will consider such comments in good faith,
provided, however, that the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.09 will not apply to any release or announcement made
or proposed to be made by the Company in connection with any Takeover Proposal.

Section 6.10 Takeover Statutes. If any state takeover Law or state Law that purports to limit or restrict business
combinations or the ability to acquire or vote Shares (including any “control share acquisition,” “fair price,” “business
combination” or other similar takeover Law) becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company and the Company Board
shall take all action reasonably available to it to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

Section 6.11 Stock Exchange De-listing. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part pursuant to applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ to enable the
de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Shares under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, provided the Company shall not be required to take any
action that would be effective or irrevocable prior to the Effective Time.

Section 6.12 Company SEC Documents. From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company will
timely file with the SEC all Company SEC Documents required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act, and should any error or omission in a previously filed Company SEC Document be identified, the Company will make
any required filings or amendments necessary to ensure that such filings do not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of its filing date, or if amended after
the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, each such Company SEC Document will comply in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be. As
of its filing date or, if amended after the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, each such
Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a
registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed after the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became effective after to the date of this
Agreement, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

Section 6.13 Employees.

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent to provide each Company Employee
who continues to be employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent as of the Effective Time
(each, a “Continuing Employee”) with (i) at least the same level of base salary or hourly wage rate, as the case may be,
that was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual cash
performance bonus opportunities (but not equity or cash-settled equity based incentive opportunities) that are no less than
the target annual cash performance bonus opportunities in effect with respect to such

Table of Contents

Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance pay and benefits to any Continuing Employee
who incurs a “qualifying termination” at any time during the one-year period following the Effective Time at levels that are
no less favorable than the levels of such severance pay and benefits as in effect under the applicable Company Benefit
Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time (where, for such purpose, “qualifying termination” shall mean any termination
of employment that would have resulted in severance pay and benefits under such Company Benefit Plan if such
termination had occurred immediately prior to the Effective Time), and (iv) other employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. In
addition, without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent
to, pay the amount of any cash bonus or commission that becomes earned and payable to eligible employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of those Company Benefit Plans that are cash bonus or
commission plans set forth in Section 6.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and made available to Parent by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, for the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs in accordance with their terms.

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of Parent to, cause any employee benefit plans (but excluding any defined benefit pension, retiree welfare
benefit or equity compensation plans) in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to participate following the Effective
Time (collectively, the “Post-Closing Plans”) to recognize for purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of benefits thereunder,
service with the Company and Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessor entities, in each case, to the same
extent such service was recognized under a comparable Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time (except to the
extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service). With respect
to any Post-Closing Plan that is a health or welfare benefit plan which replaces coverage under a comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent will, and will
cause its Affiliates to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting condition exclusions and all waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Continuing Employee to the extent waived or satisfied under
the comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) provide that Continuing Employees will be immediately eligible to participate in any such Post-Closing Plan,
without any waiting period, to the extent such Continuing Employee was eligible to participate in the comparable Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) credit each Continuing Employee for any applicable amounts
paid or eligible expenses incurred (whether in the nature of co-payments or coinsurance amounts, amounts applied toward
deductibles or other out-of-pocket expenses) by such Continuing Employee (and his or her covered dependents) under the
terms of the Company Benefit Plan toward satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements
under the applicable Post-Closing Plan that replaces such Company Benefit Plan for the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs.

(c) With respect to any accrued but unused vacation and paid time off to which any Continuing Employee is
entitled pursuant to the vacation and paid time off policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent to, assume the liability for
such accrued vacation and paid time off and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued vacation and paid time
off in accordance with the practice and policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent.

(d) The Company shall not implement any plant closing or layoff of employees that implicates the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or any similar applicable Law from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time without advance notice to Parent.

the stockholders of the Company unless such approval is required by Law. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any
such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of
such rights.

Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

(b) Except with respect to an Arbitration Action, each of the Parties hereby (i) expressly and irrevocably submits
to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, to the extent such court
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware, or, if such federal
court declines to accept jurisdiction, any state court within the State of Delaware that has jurisdiction) in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court,
(iii) agrees that it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, in any court other than such court, (iv) agrees that each of the other Parties will have the right to
bring any Action for enforcement of a judgment entered by such court and (v) expressly and irrevocably waives (and
agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, in such court or that any such Action brought in such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action will be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 9.09(b), any Action (i) taken pursuant to Section 9.11 seeking an Order of specific
performance or other equitable relief of Parent’s obligations hereunder or (ii) taken by the Company against Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to Section 8.02 seeking damages for fraud or Willful Breach (any such Action referred to in
subclauses (i) and (ii), an “Arbitration Action”), shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the
Singapore International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International
Arbitration Centre (“SIAC Rules”) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in
this clause. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of 3 arbitrators. The language of the
arbitration shall be English. The Parties agree that any arbitration commenced pursuant to this clause shall be conducted
in accordance with the Expedited Procedure set out in Rule 5.2 of the SIAC Rules. Each of the Parties hereby expressly
and irrevocably agrees that a final ruling in such arbitral Action will be conclusive and may be enforced in any jurisdiction
by suit or in any other manner provided by Law.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Arbitration Actions
will only be resolved in accordance with Section 9.09(c), and any other Action or dispute arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, will only be resolved in accordance with
Section 9.09(b).

Section 9.10 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement
will be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written consent
of the other Parties and any purported assignment without such consent will be void. Subject to the preceding sentences
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

Section 9.11 Specific Performance.

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and
that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, the Parties will, subject to Section 9.11(b), be entitled to an
Order to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this

Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for any such breach.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be entitled to the granting of an Order of
specific performance or other equitable relief of Parent’s obligation to take the actions it is entitled to take to cause the full
funding of the Financing under the Equity Commitment Letter and to consummate the Merger if and only in the event each
of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions in Section 7.01 (other than the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.01(c) or 7.01(d) which have not been satisfied due to any Action of a PRC Governmental Entity or the impact of
any Law or Order enacted or issued by a PRC Governmental Entity, and to the extent a non-worldwide closing is possible)
and Section 7.02 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but each of which at
such time is capable of being satisfied) have been satisfied or waived; (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the
Closing when required pursuant to Section 1.02; and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to
Parent that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and that if an Order of specific performance or other
equitable relief is granted and the Financing is consummated, the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, while the
Company may pursue both a grant of an Order of specific performance or other equitable relief as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by this Section 9.11(b) and to consummate the Merger and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee
(only to the extent expressly permitted by Section 8.02(c)), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both (i) such grant of an Order of specific performance or other equitable relief to cause the funding of
the Financing and to consummate the Merger and (ii) payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

Section 9.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF
THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 9.12.

Annex B

November 2, 2016

Board of Directors
Lattice Semiconductor Corporation
111 SW Fifth Ave, Suite 700
Portland, OR 97204

Members of the Board:

We understand that Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (the “Company”), Canyon Bridge Acquisition Company, Inc. (the
“Buyer”) and Canyon Bridge Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (“Acquisition Sub”), propose to enter
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated November 2, 2016 (the “Merger
Agreement”), which provides, among other things, for the merger (the “Merger”) of Acquisition Sub with and into the
Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer, and each
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), other
than shares held in treasury or held by the Buyer, Acquisition Sub or any subsidiary of the Company or as to which
appraisal rights have been perfected, will be converted into the right to receive $8.30 per share in cash (the
“Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock.

For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:
 

1) Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company;
 

2) Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company;
 

3) Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company;
 

4) Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior
executives of the Company;

 

5) Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock;
 

6) Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the Company Common
Stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the Company and their securities;

 

7) Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;
 

8) Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and the Buyer and certain
parties and their financial and legal advisors;

 

9) Reviewed the Merger Agreement, the draft equity commitment letter from certain investors substantially in the form of
the drafts dated November 1, 2016 (the “Commitment Letter”) and certain related documents; and

 

10) Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have
deemed appropriate.

Table of Contents

We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and formed a substantial basis
for this opinion. With respect to the financial projections, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future
financial performance of the Company. In addition, we have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance
with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions,
including, among other things, that the Buyer will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the
Commitment Letter and that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof
furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental,
regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or
restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived
in the proposed Merger. We are not legal, tax or regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon,
without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to
legal, tax or regulatory matters. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the
Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the transaction. We have not
made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been furnished with
any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as
in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may
affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or
reaffirm this opinion.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will
receive a fee for our services, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. Morgan Stanley
may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Buyer and the Company and their respective
affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services. In addition, Morgan Stanley, its
affiliates, directors or officers, including individuals working with the Company in connection with this transaction, may
commit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by the Buyer.

Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and
individual wealth management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and
brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing
investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at
any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may
trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or
equity securities or loans of the Buyer, the Company, or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be
involved in this transaction, or any related derivative instrument.

This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in
accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and
may not be used for any other purpose or disclosed without our prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion
may be included in its entirety in any filing the Company is required to make with the Securities and Exchange Commission
in connection with this transaction if such inclusion is required by applicable law. In addition, Morgan Stanley expresses no
opinion or recommendation as to how the shareholders of the Company should vote in connection with the Merger.

Annex C

APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS

DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

§ 262. Appraisal rights.

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand
pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has
neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be
entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the
circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a
holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by
those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an
interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the
depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger
or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and,
subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264
of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section
shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at
the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more
than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the
constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the
surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of
merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock
anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in
respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository
receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on
a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of
this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

Table of Contents

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or §
267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares
of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title,
appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including
those set forth in subsections (d) and (e), shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted for
the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent corporation” and/or
“surviving or resulting corporation.”

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available
for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger
or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those
set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in
accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection
(b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and
shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy
of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the
corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or
vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action
must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has
complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the
merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation
within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who
are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any
or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may,
and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the
effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date
of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the
consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice,
demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand

will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective
date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or
resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date;
provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be
sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in
accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the
corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima
facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice,
each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the
notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record
date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date
shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any
stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal
rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of
the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request,
shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting
forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands
for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be
mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under
subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the
beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such
person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or
resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the
petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment
for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or
resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied
by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place
fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the
stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein

stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a
newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems
advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall
be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and
who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal
for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in
Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with
such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or
consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are
available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such
shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1%
of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the
merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to §
253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in
accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.
Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the
amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors.
Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection,
interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly
and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time
during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the
entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if
any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore
accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled
to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the
final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by
the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or
resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case
of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the
surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other
decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this
State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable
in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all

or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as
provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of
dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a
date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an
appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the
surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of
the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in
subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to
an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be
dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms
as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand
for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the
surviving or resulting corporation.
