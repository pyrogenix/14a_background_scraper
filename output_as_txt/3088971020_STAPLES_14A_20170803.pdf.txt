August 3, 2017

Dear Stockholder:

        We cordially invite you to attend a special meeting of the stockholders of Staples, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which we refer to as
"we," "us," "Staples" or the "Company," to be held on September 6, 2017 at 10:00 am, local time, at the offices of WilmerHale LLP, 60 State
Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109.

        On June 28, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger, as it may be amended from time to time, which we refer
to as the merger agreement, with Arch Parent Inc., which we refer to as Parent, and Arch Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent, which we refer to as Merger Sub, providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving
the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub are beneficially owned by funds managed by Sycamore Partners
Management, L.P., which is a private equity firm based in New York specializing in consumer and retail investments.

        At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on the following matters:

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement; 

• a proposal to approve, on a nonbinding advisory basis, the "golden parachute" compensation that may be payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger as reported on the Golden Parachute Compensation table on page 91 of the
accompanying proxy statement; and 

• a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        If the merger is consummated, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger will, other than excluded shares (as defined in the accompanying proxy statement), be converted into the right to receive $10.25 in
cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax.

        The board of directors of the Company, which we refer to as the Board, has unanimously adopted and approved the merger agreement
and recommended that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. The Board made its
determination after consultation with its legal and financial advisors and consideration of a number of factors described in the accompanying
proxy statement. The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, "FOR"
approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation and "FOR" approval of the proposal to
approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        Your vote is very important.    The merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common
stock entitled to vote at the special meeting vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        The accompanying proxy statement provides you with detailed information about the special meeting, the merger agreement and the
merger. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to the accompanying proxy statement. We encourage you to carefully read the
entire proxy

Items of Business
 

To consider and vote on:
 

• a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 28, 2017, as it may be
amended from time to time, which we refer to as the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached
as Annex A to the accompanying proxy statement, by and among Staples, Inc., a Delaware

to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Record Date
 

You may vote if you were a stockholder of record at the close of business on August 1, 2017.

Proxy Voting
 

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares of Company common stock you
own. The merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement cannot be consummated
unless the merger agreement is adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares
of Company common stock that are issued, outstanding and entitled to vote as of the record date. Even
if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, we request that you complete, sign, date and return,
as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or submit
your proxy by telephone or the Internet prior to the special meeting to ensure that your shares of
Company common stock will be represented and voted at the special meeting if you are unable to
attend. If you do not attend the special meeting and fail to return your proxy card or fail to submit your
proxy by phone or the Internet, your shares of Company common stock will not be counted for
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and will have the same
effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.



9/18/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/791519/000104746917004941/a2232862zdefm14a.htm

Table of Contents

 If you are a stockholder of record, voting in person at the special meeting will revoke any proxy
previously submitted. If you hold your shares of Company common stock through a bank, brokerage
firm or other nominee, you should follow the procedures provided by your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee in order to vote. As a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock held in
"street name," you have the right to direct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee on how to vote
the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are
not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the special meeting unless you
request and obtain a valid proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.

Recommendation
 

The board of directors of the Company, which we refer to as the Board, has unanimously adopted and
approved the merger agreement and recommended that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. The Board made its determination after consultation with its
legal and financial advisors and consideration of a number of factors described in the accompanying
proxy statement. The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement, "FOR" approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden
parachute" compensation and "FOR" approval of the proposal to approve one or more
adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.

Attendance
 

Only stockholders of record or their duly authorized proxies or beneficial owners with proof of
ownership have the right to attend the special meeting. If your shares of Company common stock are
held through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, please bring to the special meeting a copy of
your brokerage statement evidencing your beneficial ownership of Company common stock. If you are
the representative of a corporate or institutional stockholder, you must present proof that you are the
representative of such stockholder.

Appraisal Rights
 

Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which we refer to as the DGCL, if the
merger is completed, holders of Company common stock who do not vote in favor of adoption of the
merger agreement and satisfy other conditions set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will have the right
to seek an appraisal by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the fair value of their shares. In order to
exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for an appraisal of your shares prior
to the stockholder vote to adopt the merger agreement (and must not fail to perfect or otherwise
effectively withdraw your demand or waive or lose the right to appraisal), you must not vote in favor of
adoption of the merger agreement and you must comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL and explained in the accompanying proxy statement. See "Appraisal Rights" beginning on
page 138 and Annex D of the accompanying proxy statement.

The Special Meeting (Page 29) 

Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting (Page 29) 

        The special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, which we refer to as the special meeting, will be held on September 6,
2017, starting at 10:00 am, local time, at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston,
Massachusetts 02109.

        At the special meeting, holders, which we refer to as stockholders, of common stock of the Company, $0.0006 par value per share,
which we refer to as Company common stock, will be asked to consider and vote on:

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement; 

• a proposal to approve, on a nonbinding advisory basis, the "golden parachute" compensation that may be payable to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger as reported on the Golden Parachute Compensation table on
page 91; and 

• a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.

Record Date and Quorum (Page 29) 

        You are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting if you owned shares of Company common stock as of the
close of business on August 1, 2017, which is the date we have set as the record date for the special meeting, and which we refer to as
the record date. You will have one vote for each share of Company common stock that you owned on the record date. As of the record
date, there were 656,713,321 shares of Company common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. A quorum is
necessary to transact business at the special meeting, including the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the nonbinding
advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation. A majority of the shares of Company common stock that are issued,
outstanding and entitled to vote at the close of business on the record date, present in person or represented by proxy, at the special
meeting constitutes a quorum for the purposes of the special meeting. The Company's amended and restated by-laws, as amended,
which we refer to as our by-laws, provide that a special meeting may be adjourned whether or not a quorum is present.

Vote Required (Page 30) 

        Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to vote thereon as of the record date.

        Under our by-laws, approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation and approval of the
proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, require the affirmative
vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of all of the shares present or represented at the special meeting and voting on such
matters.

other nominee with voting instructions, your shares of Company common stock will not be voted on the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, which will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, and your shares of
Company common stock will not have an effect on approval of the advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation or
the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        You have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time before it is
exercised, by submitting a later-dated proxy through any of the methods available to you, by giving written notice of revocation to our
Secretary at Staples, Inc., Five Hundred Staples Drive, Framingham, Massachusetts 01702, which must be filed with the Secretary by
the time the special meeting begins, or by attending the special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the special meeting alone
will not revoke your proxy.

The Merger (Page 35) 

        The merger agreement provides that Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company. The Company will be the surviving
corporation in the merger and will continue to do business following the merger. As a result of the merger, the Company will cease to
be a publicly traded company. If the merger is consummated, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving
corporation.

Merger Consideration (Page 99) 

        In the merger, each share of Company common stock, other than as provided below, will be converted into the right to receive
$10.25 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax. We refer to this consideration per share of
Company common stock to be paid in the merger as the merger consideration or the per share merger consideration. The following
shares of Company common stock will not be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration in connection with the
merger: (a) shares held by any of our stockholders who are entitled to, and who do not, vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement and who otherwise properly exercise, and do not withdraw or lose, appraisal rights, which we refer to as the

(b) shares held in the treasury of the Company and (c) shares owned by any subsidiary of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any
other affiliate of Parent. We sometimes refer to the shares described in clauses (b) and (c) in the foregoing sentence, collectively, as the
cancelled shares.

Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board (Page 51) 

        After careful consideration of various factors described in the section entitled "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Board," the Board, by a unanimous vote of all directors:

• determined and declared that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders; 

• adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement; 

• declared that the terms of the merger are fair to the Company and the Company's stockholders; and 

• determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company for the Board to submit the merger agreement to
the Company's stockholders for adoption, directed that the merger agreement be submitted to the Company's
stockholders at a special meeting of the Company's stockholders for their adoption, and recommended that the
Company's stockholders adopt the merger agreement.

        The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, "FOR" approval
of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation and "FOR" approval of the proposal to
approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Opinions of the Company's Financial Advisors (Page 56 and Annexes B and C)

of the Company (other than holders of shares held in treasury, or held by any subsidiary of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or any

was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders or, in the case of Morgan Stanley, the $10.25 per share merger
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company common stock (other than holders of excluded shares) pursuant
to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

Financing of the Merger (Page 74) 

        Parent estimates that the total amount of funds required to complete the merger and related transactions, including to pay fees and
expenses in connection with the merger, is approximately $6.9 billion. Parent expects to fund this amount through a combination of:

• cash equity contributions from investment funds managed by Sycamore and Neuberger Berman Private Equity and
investment funds affiliated with HarbourVest Partners, which we refer to collectively as the "funds," of up to
$1,920 million; and 

• debt financing consisting of commitments for (i) a senior secured first lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal
amount of $2,400 million, (ii) an asset based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of
$1,200 million, (iii) a senior unsecured bridge facility or senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of
$1,600 million, (iv) an asset based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million and (v) an
asset based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, on terms and conditions set forth
in the debt commitment letter (as defined and described in "The Merger—Financing of the Merger").

        The consummation of the merger is not subject to a financing condition (although the funding of the debt and equity financing is
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the commitment letters under which the financing will be provided).

        See "The Merger—Financing of the Merger" beginning on page 74 for additional information.

Limited Guarantee (Page 77) 

        On June 28, 2017, investment funds managed by Sycamore and Neuberger Berman Private Equity and investment funds affiliated
with HarbourVest Partners, each of which we refer to as a fund, delivered a guarantee, which we refer to as the limited guarantee,
pursuant to which each fund has agreed to, severally but not jointly, guarantee the due and punctual performance and discharge of such
fund's respective percentage of:

• the obligations of Parent under the merger agreement to pay the Parent termination fee (as defined below in "—
Termination Fees") to the Company as and when due; and 

• certain expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to the Company as and when
due.

        The obligations of each fund under the limited guarantee are subject to an aggregate cap of $345 million based on the applicable
fund's pro rata percentage as set forth in the limited guarantee.

        See "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees" beginning on page 127.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger (Page 79) 

        In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that the Company's
directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our
stockholders generally, as more fully described below. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other
matters, in reaching the determination that the merger and the merger agreement were advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders and that the terms of the merger were fair to the Company and the Company's stockholders and in
making their recommendation regarding the adoption of the merger agreement as described in "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Board" beginning on page 51. These interests include:

• except as otherwise agreed in writing between the holder and Parent, accelerated vesting of Company restricted stock
units held by the Company's directors and executive officers, and cancellation and conversion of each such restricted
stock unit into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the merger consideration of $10.25 multiplied by each share
of Company common stock underlying such restricted stock unit, on the terms set forth in the merger agreement; 

• except as otherwise agreed in writing between the holder and Parent, accelerated vesting of Company performance
share awards, and cancellation and conversion of each such performance share award into the right to receive a cash
payment equal to the merger consideration of $10.25 multiplied by the target number of shares of Company common
stock subject to such performance share award, on the terms set forth in the merger agreement; 

• in the event of certain terminations of employment, cash severance payments payable to executive officers of the
Company pursuant to severance benefits agreements between the Company and such executive officers and continued
health, dental and vision coverage benefits provided to such executive officers pursuant to Company policy; 

• cash payments that may be made pursuant to arrangements into which the Company may enter with up to eight
individuals to "gross up" such individuals (in whole or in part) for any excise taxes required to be paid by any such
individual pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code
(not to exceed $20,704,118 in the aggregate); and

• continued indemnification and liability insurance for directors and officers following completion of the merger.

        See "The Merger—Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page 79 for additional information.

Approval of "Golden Parachute" Compensation (page 133) 

        In accordance with Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the Exchange Act, and
Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act, we are providing stockholders with the opportunity to cast a nonbinding advisory vote with
respect to certain payments that may be made to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, or "golden parachute"
compensation, as reported on the Golden Parachute Compensation table on page 91. The Board recommends that you vote "FOR"
approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation.

        Approval of the proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation requires the approval of a majority of the votes cast on this
proposal. Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote with respect to "golden parachute"
compensation is an advisory vote and will not be binding on us. Therefore, regardless of whether stockholders approve the "golden
parachute" compensation, if the merger agreement is adopted by the stockholders and the merger is completed, the "golden parachute"
compensation will still be paid to our named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of such
compensation.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 93) 

        The exchange of shares of Company common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable transaction to U.S.
holders and certain non-U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder (or a non-U.S. holder that is subject to U.S.
federal income tax on its gain from the merger) who exchanges shares of Company common stock for cash in the merger generally will
recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash
received (determined before deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) with respect to such shares and the stockholder's adjusted
tax basis in such shares. This may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and/or foreign income or other tax laws.
You should read "The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 93 for the definition of
"U.S. holder" and "non-U.S. holder" and a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. You
should also consult your tax advisor for a complete analysis of the effect of the merger on your U.S. federal, state and local and/or
foreign taxes.

Regulatory Approvals (Page 96) 

        The merger is subject to the reporting and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended, which we refer to as the HSR Act. On July 26, 2017, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination
of the waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the merger. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be
consummated if any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any order,
executive order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction (temporary, preliminary or permanent) or statute, rule or regulation which has the
effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting, restraining, preventing or enjoining consummation of the merger.

The Merger Agreement (Page 97) 

Merger Consideration (Page 99) 

        If the merger is completed, each share of Company common stock, other than the dissenting shares and the cancelled shares will
be converted into the right to receive $10.25 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax.

Treatment of Company Stock Awards (Page 102) 

        Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger, each then-outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of Company common stock with an exercise price per
share equal to or greater than the per share merger consideration will be canceled, without any consideration being payable in respect
thereof, and will have no further force or effect. Because the current exercise price per share of each outstanding Company stock option
is equal to or greater than the per share merger consideration, all Company stock options will be canceled, without payment of any
consideration therefor, and will have no further force or effect.

        Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger, (i) each Company restricted stock unit that will become vested, by its terms, as a result of the closing of the merger will
automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount of cash equal to the product
of (A) the total number of shares of Company common stock then underlying such Company restricted stock unit multiplied by (B) the
per share merger consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, with such amount payable
promptly after the closing of the merger; and (ii) each Company restricted stock unit that will not be vested, by its terms, on or before
the closing of the merger will automatically be canceled and converted into the contingent right to receive from the surviving
corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company common stock then underlying such
Company restricted stock unit multiplied by (B) the per share merger consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all
applicable withholding, with such amount payable promptly following the earlier of (1) the date on which the original vesting
conditions applicable to such underlying restricted stock unit, including and taking into account any accelerated vesting provisions set
forth therein, are satisfied and (2) the date that is 180 days following the closing, in each case, subject to the holder's continued service
with the Company through the applicable date; provided that the 180 day period referenced in clause (2) is extended to the earlier of
(x) the last day of the tenth month following the closing and (y) October 31, 2018, for certain Company restricted stock units granted in
July 2017.

        Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger, (i) each Company performance share award that is then outstanding and unvested and that is held by a former employee
of the Company (as determined immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) will automatically be canceled and converted
into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of the target number of shares of
Company common stock subject to such Company performance share award, as pro-rated in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company performance share award agreement, multiplied by the per share merger consideration, without any interest
thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, with such amount payable promptly after the closing of the merger; and (ii) each
Company performance share award that is then outstanding and unvested and that is held by a person who is an employee of the
Company immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will automatically be canceled and converted into the contingent right
to receive from the surviving corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of the target number of shares of Company common
stock subject to such Company performance share award multiplied by the

per share merger consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, with such amount payable
promptly following the earlier of (A) the date on which the original vesting conditions applicable to such performance share award,
including and taking into account any accelerated vesting provisions set forth therein, are satisfied and (B) the date that is 180 days
following the closing, in each case, subject to the holder's continued service with the Company through the applicable date; provided
that the merger consideration payable in respect of the Company performance share awards will be paid no later than March 15 of the
calendar year following the calendar year in which the closing occurs.

Restrictions on Solicitation of Other Offers (Page 109) 

        Under the merger agreement, until the earlier of the effective time of the merger and the termination of the merger agreement, the
Company and its subsidiaries will not, and the Company will cause its and its subsidiaries' officers and directors not to, and will use
reasonable efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries' other representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of providing non-public information)
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any acquisition proposal; 

• amend or grant a waiver or release, or publicly authorize or agree to enter into an amendment, waiver or release, under
(i) any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any Company common stock (other than for Parent or its
affiliates) or (ii) any applicable anti-takeover law or anti-takeover provision in the certificate of incorporation or by-
laws (other than for Parent or its affiliates), except, in each case, under the circumstances permitted under the merger
agreement; or 

• enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or provide access to
any non-public information to any person who has made or would reasonably be expected to make any acquisition
proposal or otherwise for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any acquisition proposal.

        However, subject to compliance with the merger agreement, at any time prior to receipt of the Company stockholder approval the
Company may, if the Board determines that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties:

• furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries to any person who has made an
acquisition proposal that did not result from a material breach of the merger agreement that the Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) is, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, a superior proposal, which we refer to as a qualified person, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement not materially
less restrictive in any substantive manner, including with respect to standstill provisions, than the confidentiality
agreement between the Company and Sycamore (and which confidentiality agreement may not include an obligation of
the Company to reimburse such person's expenses); 

• engage in discussions or negotiations (including solicitation of revised acquisition proposals) with any qualified person
regarding any acquisition proposal; or 

• amend, or grant a waiver or release under, any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any Company common
stock with any qualified person solely to allow for an acquisition proposal to be made in a confidential manner to the
Company or the Board.

Restrictions on Changes of Recommendation to Company Stockholders (Page 111) 

        Under the merger agreement, the Board must submit the merger agreement to the Company's stockholders for adoption and must
recommend that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement. Prior to the earlier of the effective time of
the merger and the termination of the merger agreement:

• the Board may not (we refer to each of the actions listed in the following five sub-bullets as a Company board
recommendation change): 

• withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw or modify, in each case in a manner
adverse to Parent, its recommendation to the Company's stockholders that the Company's stockholders adopt the
merger agreement at the special meeting, which we refer to as the recommendation; 

• fail to include the recommendation in this proxy statement; 

• fail to publicly reaffirm the recommendation within five business days of a request therefor in writing by Parent
following the public disclosure of an acquisition proposal with any person other than Parent and Merger Sub; 

• fail to recommend against any acquisition proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer within ten business
days after the commencement thereof; or 

• publicly announce an intention or resolution to effect any of the foregoing; 

• the Company and its subsidiaries may not enter into, or publicly authorize or agree to enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement
relating to any acquisition proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in the circumstances described
above in the section entitled "—Restrictions on Solicitations of Other Offers"); and 

• the Board may not adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse or
recommend, any acquisition proposal.

        However, prior to receipt of the Company stockholder approval, the Board may, (i) in response to a superior proposal that did not
result from a material breach of the merger agreement, either effect a Company board recommendation change or cause the Company
to terminate the merger agreement, provided that concurrently with or prior to such termination, the Company pays to Parent the
company termination fee as required by the merger agreement and, immediately after the termination of the merger agreement, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for such superior proposal, or (ii) in response to an intervening event, effect a
Company board recommendation change if, and only if, (in the case of either (i) or (ii)):

• the Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to effect a Company
board recommendation change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law; 

• the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect a Company board recommendation change or
termination of the merger agreement, describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such intended Company board
recommendation change or termination, which we refer to as a recommendation change notice;

• if requested by Parent, the Company will have made itself and its subsidiaries and its and their respective
representatives available and the Company will have and will have caused its subsidiaries and its and their respective
representatives to discuss and negotiate with Parent's representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement (in a manner that would obviate the need to effect such Company board
recommendation change) during the four business day period following delivery by the Company to Parent of such
recommendation change notice (it being understood that if there are any material amendments, revisions or changes to
the terms of any such superior proposal (including any revision to the amount, form or mix of consideration the
Company's stockholders would receive as a result of the superior proposal, whether or not material), the Company will
notify Parent of each such amendment, revision or change and the applicable four business day period described above
will be extended for at least two business days from the date of such notice), which we refer to as a notice period; and 

• at the end of such notice period, the Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel),
after considering any modified terms and conditions proposed by or on behalf of Parent, that the failure to effect a
Company board recommendation change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law and, with respect to a Company board recommendation change in response to a superior proposal, the
Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such
initial or revised (as applicable) superior proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal.

Conditions to the Merger (Page 124) 

        The obligation of the parties to consummate the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions,
including:

• the obtaining of the Company stockholder approval; 

• the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act having
expired or early termination thereof having been granted; 

• no governmental entity of competent jurisdiction having enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any order,
executive order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction (temporary, preliminary or permanent) or statute, rule or regulation
which is in effect and which has the effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting, restraining, preventing
or enjoining consummation of the merger;

which we refer to as the outside date, except that a party to the merger agreement will not be permitted to terminate the

        If either the Company or Parent terminates the merger agreement because the Company stockholder approval is not obtained and
at the time of the stockholder vote, the debt and equity commitment letters are in full force and effect or have been replaced with letters
providing for alternative financing commitments in a corresponding amount sufficient to consummate the merger, the Company will
pay to Parent (within two business days following the delivery by Parent of an invoice therefor) any and all out-of-pocket fees and
expenses actually incurred by Parent or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, investigation,
negotiation, execution and performance of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, which we
refer to as the Parent expenses, up to a maximum amount of $15,000,000. To the extent a Company termination fee becomes payable,
any payment previously made pursuant to the preceding sentence will be credited against the obligation of the Company to pay the
Company termination fee.

        Subject to certain limitations, Parent will pay the Company a termination fee equal to $343,000,000, which we refer to as the
Parent termination fee, in the event that the merger agreement is terminated:

• by the Company, prior to the effective time, if there has been a breach of, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in the merger agreement, which
breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform (i) would cause certain closing conditions applicable to the Company set forth
in the merger agreement not to be satisfied, and (ii) is not capable of being cured by the outside date or, if capable of

Market Price of Company Common Stock (Page 135) 

        The 10-day volume weighted average price per share of the Company's common stock for the period ended April 3, 2017, the last
full trading day before widespread media speculation about a potential acquisition of the Company, was $8.58. On August 1, 2017, the
closing price for Company common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market was $10.18 per share of Company common stock. You are
encouraged to obtain current market quotations for Company common stock in connection with voting your shares of Company
common stock.

        The Company has historically paid regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock. The Company most recently paid a cash
dividend on July 13, 2017 of $0.12 per share. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Company
has agreed to suspend the payment of its regular quarterly dividend following payment of the July 13 dividend.

Appraisal Rights (Page 138) 

        If the merger is completed, record holders of Company common stock as of the record date who submit a written demand for
appraisal before the vote is taken on the adoption of the merger agreement, do not fail to perfect or otherwise effectively withdraw their
demand or waive or lose the right to appraisal, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, hold their shares of
Company common stock continuously through the effective time of the merger and otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL may elect to pursue their appraisal rights to receive, in lieu of the $10.25 per share merger consideration, an
amount in cash equal to the judicially determined "fair value" of their shares, which fair value will be determined as of the effective
time of the merger and could be more or less than, or the same as, the per share merger consideration for the Company common stock.
For a summary of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, see "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 138. An executed
proxy that is not marked "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement will be voted "FOR" the
adoption of the merger agreement and the stockholder submitting that proxy will lose the right to seek an appraisal of his, her or its
shares of Company common stock.

        A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex D to this proxy statement. Failure to follow the procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. We encourage you to read these provisions carefully and in their
entirety.

        ANY COMPANY STOCKHOLDER WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS OR WHO WISHES TO
PRESERVE HIS, HER OR ITS RIGHT TO DO SO SHOULD REVIEW ANNEX D CAREFULLY AND SHOULD CONSULT HIS,
HER OR ITS LEGAL ADVISOR, SINCE FAILURE TO TIMELY AND FULLY COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH
THEREIN WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SUCH RIGHTS.

Delisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock (Page 143) 

        If the merger is consummated, the Company common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market and deregistered under
the Exchange Act. Accordingly, following the consummation of the merger, we would no longer file periodic reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the SEC, on account of the Company common stock.

Conduct of Our Business if the Merger is Not Completed (Page 143) 

        In the event that the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason,
our stockholders will not receive any consideration from Parent or Merger Sub for their shares of Company common stock. Instead, we
would remain an independent public company, our common stock would continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market
and our stockholders would continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they currently are subject with respect
to their ownership of Company common stock. If the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks
and opportunities on the future value of our shares, including the risk that the market price of Company common stock may decline to
the extent that the current market price of our stock reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. If the merger is not
completed, our business could be disrupted, including our ability to retain and hire key personnel, potential adverse reactions or
changes to our business relationships and uncertainty surrounding our future plans and prospects.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER 

        The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the merger, the merger
agreement and the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a Company
stockholder. Please refer to the "Summary" and the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this
proxy statement and the documents referred to in this proxy statement, which you should read carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain
the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under "Where You Can Find
More Information" beginning on page 145.

Q.    What is the proposed transaction and what effects will it have on the Company?

A. The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company by Parent pursuant to the merger agreement. If the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement is approved by our stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or
waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation. As a result of the
merger, the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and will no longer be a publicly held corporation, and you
will no longer have any interest in our future earnings or growth. In addition, the Company common stock will be delisted from the
Nasdaq Stock Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account
of Company common stock.

Q.    What will I receive if the merger is consummated?

A. Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration of $10.25 in cash, without interest
and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax, for each share of Company common stock that you own, unless you are
entitled to and have properly demanded appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL. For example, if you own 1,000 shares of Company
common stock, you will receive $10,250 in cash in exchange for your shares of Company common stock, without interest and subject
to deduction for any required withholding tax. You will not receive any shares of the capital stock in the surviving corporation.

Q.    How does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of Company common stock prior to announcement of
the merger?

A. The merger consideration of $10.25 per share of Company common stock represents an approximately 20% premium to the 10-day
volume weighted average price per share of the Company's common stock for the period ended April 3, 2017, the last full trading day
before widespread media speculation about a potential acquisition of the Company.

Q.    What will holders of Company stock awards receive if the merger is consummated?

A. Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger, each then-outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of Company common stock with an exercise price per
share equal to or greater than the per share merger consideration will be canceled, without any consideration being payable in respect
thereof, and will have no further force or effect. Because the current exercise price per share of each outstanding Company stock
option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, all Company stock options will be canceled, without payment of any
consideration therefor, and will have no further force or effect. 

Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger, (i) each Company restricted stock unit that

will become vested, by its terms, as a result of the closing of the merger will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to
receive from the surviving corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company common
stock then underlying such Company restricted stock unit multiplied by (B) the per share merger consideration, without any interest
thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, with such amount payable promptly after the closing of the merger and (ii) each
Company restricted stock unit that will not be vested, by its terms, on or before the closing of the merger will automatically be
canceled and converted into the contingent right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of
(A) the total number of shares of Company common stock then underlying such Company restricted stock unit multiplied by (B) the
per share merger consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, with such amount payable
promptly following the earlier of (1) the date on which the original vesting conditions applicable to such underlying restricted stock
unit, including and taking into account any accelerated vesting provisions set forth therein, are satisfied and (2) the date that is
180 days following the closing in each case, subject to the holder's continued service with the Company through the applicable date;
provided that the 180 day period referenced in clause (2) is extended to the earlier of (x) the last day of the tenth month following
closing and (y) October 31, 2018, for certain Company restricted stock units granted in July 2017.

Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger, (i) each Company performance share award that is then outstanding and unvested and that is held by a former employee of
the Company (as determined immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) will automatically be canceled and converted into
the right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of the target number of shares of Company
common stock subject to such Company performance share award, as pro-rated in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Company performance share award agreement, multiplied by the per share merger consideration, without any interest thereon and
subject to all applicable withholding, with such amount payable promptly after the closing of the merger and (ii) each Company
performance share award that is then outstanding and unvested and that is held by a person who is an employee of the Company
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will automatically be canceled and converted into the contingent right to receive
from the surviving corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of the target number of shares of Company common stock
subject to such Company performance share award multiplied by the per share merger consideration, without any interest thereon and
subject to all applicable withholding, with such amount payable promptly following on the earlier of (A) the date on which the
original vesting conditions applicable to such performance share award, including and taking into account any accelerated vesting
provisions set forth therein, are satisfied and (B) the date that is 180 days following the closing in each case, subject to the holder's
continued service with the Company through the applicable date; provided that the merger consideration payable in respect of the
Company performance share awards will be paid no later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
closing occurs.

Q.    What will happen to the Company's employee stock purchase plan?

A. The Board has suspended the Company's employee stock purchase plan indefinitely effective as of July 1, 2017. The Board will
terminate the employee stock purchase plan as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. During the period from the
date of the merger agreement until the termination of the Company's employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the merger
agreement, we will not permit any offering periods to occur, and no shares of Company common stock will be issued under the
employee stock purchase plan.

Table of Contents

Q.    How does the Board recommend that I vote?

A. The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, "FOR" approval of the
nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation and "FOR" approval of the proposal to approve one or
more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the
time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Q.    Why is the Board recommending that I vote "FOR" approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement?

A. After careful consideration of various factors described in the section entitled "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Board," the Board, by a unanimous vote of all directors: 

• determined and declared that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein, are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; 

• adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; 

• declared that the terms of the merger are fair to the Company and the Company's stockholders; and 

• determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company for the Board to submit the merger agreement to the
Company's stockholders for adoption, directed that the merger agreement be submitted to the Company's stockholders at a
special meeting of the Company's stockholders for their adoption, and recommended that the Company's stockholders adopt
the merger agreement.

Q.    When do you expect the merger to be consummated?

A. We are working towards completing the merger as soon as possible. Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions,
including the approval by our stockholders of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, we currently anticipate that the merger will
be consummated during the third fiscal quarter of 2017.

Q.    What happens if the merger is not consummated?

A. If the merger agreement is not adopted by the stockholders of the Company or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason,
the stockholders of the Company would not receive any payment for their shares of Company common stock in connection with the
merger. Instead, the Company would remain an independent public company, and the Company common stock would continue to be
listed and traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Under specified circumstances, the Company may be required to pay to Parent a fee
with respect to the termination of the merger agreement or certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent in connection
with the authorization, preparation, investigation, negotiation, execution and performance of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or Parent may be required to pay to the Company a fee with respect to the
termination of the merger agreement, as described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees" beginning on
page 127.

Q.    Is the merger expected to be taxable to me?

A. Yes. The exchange of shares of Company common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable transaction to U.S.
holders and certain non-U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder (or a non-U.S. holder that is subject to U.S.
federal income tax on its gain from the merger) who exchanges shares of Company common stock for cash in the merger generally
will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of
cash received (determined before deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) with respect to such shares and the stockholder's
adjusted tax basis in such shares. This may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and/or foreign income or other
tax laws. You should read "The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 93 for the
definition of "U.S. holder" and "non-U.S. holder" and a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger. Because individual circumstances may differ, you should also consult your tax advisor for a complete analysis of the effect of
the merger on your U.S. federal, state and local and/or foreign taxes.

Q.    Do any of the Company's directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in addition to my interests
as a stockholder?

A. Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware
that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our
stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the
merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by the stockholders of the Company.
See "The Merger—Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page 79.

Q.    Why am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form?

A. You are receiving this proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the
Board for use at the special meeting because you owned shares of Company common stock as of the record date for the special
meeting. This proxy statement describes matters on which we urge you to vote and is intended to assist you in deciding how to vote
your shares of Company common stock with respect to such matters.

Q.    When and where is the special meeting?

A. The special meeting of stockholders of the Company will be held on September 6, 2017 at 10:00 am, local time, at the offices of
Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109.

Q.    What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?

A. You are being asked to consider and vote on: 

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement; 

• a proposal to approve, on a nonbinding advisory basis, the "golden parachute" compensation that may be payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger as reported on the Golden Parachute Compensation table on page 91; and 

• a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Q.    What vote is required for the Company's stockholders to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement?

A. The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company
common stock entitled to vote thereon as of the record date. 

Because the affirmative vote required to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is based upon the total number of
outstanding shares of Company common stock, if you fail to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the special meeting, or if you vote
"ABSTAIN," or if you do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with voting instructions, it will have the same
effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Q.    What vote is required for the Company's stockholders to approve the proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation and
the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement?

A. Approval of the proposals regarding "golden parachute" compensation and adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of all of the shares present or
represented at the special meeting and voting on each of these proposals. 

If you vote "ABSTAIN" on the proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation or the proposal to approve one or more
adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time
of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, this will have no effect on these proposals. If you fail to
submit a proxy or to vote in person at the special meeting, or if you do not provide your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with
voting instructions, your shares of Company common stock will not be voted on these proposals, and thus will have no effect on these
proposals.

Q.    Why am I being asked to cast a nonbinding advisory vote to approve "golden parachute" compensation that the Company's
named executive officers will receive in connection with the merger?

A. The SEC's rules require us to seek a nonbinding advisory vote with respect to certain payments that will be made to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger, or "golden parachute" compensation.

Q.    What will happen if stockholders do not approve the "golden parachute" compensation at the special meeting?

A. Approval of "golden parachute" compensation that our named executive officers may receive in connection with the merger is not a
condition to completion of the merger. The vote with respect to "golden parachute" compensation is an advisory vote and will not be
binding on us. Therefore, regardless of whether stockholders approve the "golden parachute" compensation, if the merger agreement
is adopted by the stockholders and the merger is completed, the "golden parachute" compensation will still be paid to our named
executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of such compensation.

Q.    Who can vote at the special meeting?

A. All of our holders of Company common stock of record as of the close of business on August 1, 2017, the record date for the special
meeting, are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. Each holder of Company common stock is entitled to cast
one vote on each matter properly brought before the special meeting for each share of Company common stock that such holder
owned as of the record date.

Q.    What if I am a participant in the Staples' Employees' 401(k) Savings Plan?

A. If you are a participant in the Staples' Employees' 401(k) Savings Plan, which we refer to as the 401(k) Plan, your proxy will serve as
voting instructions for your shares of Company common stock held in the 401(k) Plan as of the record date. Your proxy card covers
any shares held in your 401(k) Plan account, as well as any other shares registered in your name as of the record date. If you do not
provide voting instructions, the trustee will vote shares allocated to your plan account in the discretion of the 401(k) Plan fiduciary.

Q.    What is a "broker non-vote"?

A. Under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in "street name" for
customers have the authority to vote on "discretionary" proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners.
However, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to approving
non-discretionary matters, such as the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, the proposal to approve the nonbinding advisory
proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation and the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares of
Company common stock, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees are not empowered to vote those shares of Company common
stock on non-discretionary matters, which we refer to generally as "broker non-votes." Because none of the proposals to be voted on at
the special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, the Company does not expect any
broker non-votes at the special meeting.

Q.    What constitutes a quorum for the special meeting?

A. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting, including the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation. The presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a
majority of the shares of Company common stock that are issued, outstanding and entitled to vote at the close of business on the
record date constitutes a quorum for the purposes of the special meeting. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" (as described above) will
be counted as present for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the
special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, the Company does not expect any
broker non-votes at the special meeting. The special meeting may be adjourned whether or not a quorum is present.

Q.    How do I vote?

A. If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares of Company common stock, or have such shares voted, on matters
presented at the special meeting in any of the following ways: 

• in person—you may attend the special meeting and cast your vote there; or

• by proxy—stockholders of record have a choice of having their shares voted by proxy by submitting a proxy in one of the
following ways: 

• over the Internet—the website for Internet proxy submission is on your proxy card; 

• by using a toll-free telephone number noted on your proxy card; or 

• by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope. 

If you hold your shares of Company common stock in "street name," please refer to the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage
firm or other nominee to see which of the above choices are available to you. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner of shares
of Company common stock held in "street name" and wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you must provide a legal proxy
from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee at the special meeting. 

A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to submit a proxy for your shares of
Company common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when submitting a proxy over the
Internet or by telephone. 

If you are a participant in the 401(k) Plan, your proxy will serve as voting instructions for your shares of Company common stock
held in the 401(k) Plan as of the record date. Your proxy card covers any shares held in your 401(k) Plan account, as well as any other
shares registered in your name as of the record date. If you do not provide voting instructions, the trustee will vote shares allocated to
your plan account in the discretion of the 401(k) Plan fiduciary.

Q.    What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and in "street name"?

A. If your shares of Company common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company,
N.A., you are considered, with respect to those shares of Company common stock, as the "stockholder of record." This proxy
statement, and your proxy card, have been sent directly to you by the Company. 

If your shares of Company common stock are held through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial
owner of shares of Company common stock held in "street name." In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares of Company common stock, the
stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock held in "street name," you have the right to direct
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote your shares of Company common stock by following their instructions for
voting.

Q.    If my shares of Company common stock are held in "street name" by my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, will my bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee vote my shares of Company common stock for me?

A. Your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of Company common stock if you instruct your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee regarding the voting of your shares of Company common stock. If you do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee to vote your shares of Company common stock, your shares of Company common stock will not be voted and the effect will
be the same as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and your shares of Company common stock will not
have an effect on approval of the advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation or

the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Q.    How can I change or revoke my proxy?

A. You have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time before it is exercised,
by submitting a later-dated proxy through any of the methods available to you, by giving written notice of revocation to our Secretary
at Staples, Inc., Five Hundred Staples Drive, Framingham, Massachusetts 01702, which must be filed with the Secretary by the time
the special meeting begins, or by attending the special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the special meeting alone will not
revoke your proxy.

Q.    What is a proxy?

A. A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a "proxy," to vote your shares of Company common stock. The
written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a "proxy statement." The
document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Company common stock is called a "proxy card." The Board has
designated Shira Goodman, Christine Komola and Michael Williams, and each of them singly, with full power of substitution, as
proxies for the special meeting.

Q.    If a stockholder gives a proxy, how will its shares of Company common stock be voted?

A. Regardless of the method you choose to submit your proxy, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, as your proxies, will
vote your shares of Company common stock in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone proxy processes
or the enclosed proxy card, you may specify whether your shares of Company common stock should be voted for or against or to
abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting. 

If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares of Company common stock should be voted
on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement,
"FOR" approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation and "FOR" the proposal to approve
one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes
at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Q.    How are votes counted?

A. With respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." Abstentions and
broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

With respect to the proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation and the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the
special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." Abstentions and
broker non-votes will have no effect on these proposals.

Q.    What do I do if I receive more than one proxy or set of voting instructions?

A. If you hold shares of Company common stock in more than one account, you may receive more than one proxy or set of voting
instructions relating to the special meeting. These should each be voted or returned separately in accordance with the instructions
provided in this proxy statement in order to ensure that all of your shares of Company common stock are voted.

Q.    What happens if I sell my shares of Company common stock before the special meeting?

A. The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than both the date of the special meeting and the
consummation of the merger. If you transfer your shares of Company common stock after the record date but before the special
meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you transfer your
shares and each of you notifies the Company in writing of such special arrangements, you will retain your right to vote such shares at
the special meeting but will transfer the right to receive the per share merger consideration to the person to whom you transfer your
shares. You will also lose the ability to exercise appraisal rights with respect to such shares in connection with the merger.

Q.    Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?

A. The Company will pay all expenses of filing, printing and mailing this proxy statement, including solicitation expenses. The Company
has engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. ("D.F. King") to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. The Company
estimates that it will pay D.F. King a fee of approximately $17,500. The Company will also reimburse D.F. King for reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses and will indemnify D.F. King and its affiliates against certain claims, expenses, losses, damages, liabilities and
judgments. The Company may also reimburse brokers, banks and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries representing beneficial
owners of shares of Company common stock for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of Company
common stock and in obtaining voting instructions from those owners. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies
by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the Internet or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.

Q.    What do I need to do now?

A. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, after carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy
statement, please submit your proxy promptly to ensure that your shares are represented at the special meeting. If you hold your shares
of Company common stock in your own name as the stockholder of record, please submit a proxy for your shares of Company
common stock by (a) completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope,
(b) using the telephone number printed on your proxy card or (c) using the Internet proxy instructions printed on your proxy card. If
you decide to attend the special meeting and vote in person, your vote by ballot will revoke any proxy previously submitted. If you are
a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock held in "street name," please refer to the instructions provided by your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee to see which of the above choices are available to you.

Q.    Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A. No. A letter of transmittal will be mailed to you promptly, and in any event within five business days, after the effective time of the
merger, describing how you should surrender your shares of Company common stock for the per share merger consideration. If your
shares of Company common stock are held in "street name" by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you will

receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your "street name" shares of
Company common stock in exchange for the per share merger consideration. Please do NOT return your stock certificate(s) with
your proxy.

Q.    What should I do if I have lost my stock certificate?

A. If you have lost your stock certificate, please contact our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., at (888) 875-9002, to
obtain replacement certificates.

Q.    What rights do I have if I oppose the merger?

A. Stockholders of record as of the record date are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL only if they do not vote for the
adoption of the merger agreement and otherwise follow the procedures and satisfying the requirements specified in Section 262 of the
DGCL. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement. See "Appraisal Rights" beginning on
page 138.

Q.    Are there any other risks to me from the merger that I should consider?

A. Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the merger. See "Cautionary Statement Concerning
Forward-Looking Information" beginning on page 28.

Q.    Who can help answer my other questions?

A. If you have additional questions about the merger, need assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares of Company
common stock, or need additional copies of this proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please call D.F. King, our proxy solicitor,
toll-free at (866) 796-7179.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

        Statements in this proxy statement regarding the proposed transaction between Parent and the Company, the expected timetable for
completing the transaction, future financial and operating results, future opportunities for the combined company and any other statements
about Parent and the Company managements' future expectations, beliefs, goals, plans or prospects constitute forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact
(including statements containing the words "believes," "plans," "anticipates," "expects," estimates and similar expressions) should also be
considered to be forward looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Readers should not
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. The Company's actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking
statements as a result of numerous factors, some of which the Company may not be able to predict and may not be within the Company's
control. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, (i) the risk that the proposed merger may not be completed in
a timely manner, or at all, which may adversely affect the Company's business and the price of its common stock, (ii) the failure to satisfy all
of the closing conditions of the proposed merger, including the adoption of the merger agreement by the Company's stockholders and the
receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions, (iii) the occurrence of any event, change or
other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement, (iv) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the
proposed merger on the Company's business, operating results, and relationships with customers, suppliers, competitors and others, (v) risks
that the proposed merger may disrupt the Company's current plans and business operations, (vi) potential difficulties retaining employees as a
result of the proposed merger, (vii) risks related to the diverting of management's attention from the Company's ongoing business operations,
and (viii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Company related to the merger agreement or the proposed
merger. There are a number of important, additional factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated
by such forward looking statements, including the factors described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
January 28, 2017 and its most recent quarterly report filed with the SEC. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update any
forward looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this filing.

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Board for use at the special
meeting to be held on September 6, 2017, starting at 10:00 am, local time, at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60
State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. At the special meeting, holders of Company
common stock will be asked to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, to approve the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding
"golden parachute" compensation and to approve the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.

        Our stockholders must approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement in order for the merger to be consummated. If our
stockholders fail to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, the merger will not be consummated. A copy of the merger
agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, which we encourage you to read carefully in its entirety.

Record Date and Quorum 

        We have fixed the close of business on August 1, 2017 as the record date for the special meeting, and only holders of record of Company
common stock on the record date are entitled to vote at the special meeting. You are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special
meeting if you owned shares of Company common stock at the close of business on the record date. On the record date, there were
656,713,321 shares of Company common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of Company common stock entitles its holder to
one vote on all matters properly coming before the special meeting.

        A majority of the shares of Company common stock that are issued, outstanding and entitled to vote at the close of business on the
record date, present in person or represented by proxy, at the special meeting constitutes a quorum for the purposes of the special meeting.
Shares of Company common stock represented at the special meeting but not voted, including shares of Company common stock for which a
stockholder directs voting "ABSTAIN," as well as broker non-votes (described below), will be counted for purposes of establishing a
quorum. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary
authority to vote, the Company does not expect any broker non-votes at the special meeting. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the
special meeting, including the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation.
The special meeting may be adjourned whether or not a quorum is present. Once a share of Company common stock is represented at the
special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting and any recess or adjournment of the
special meeting. However, if a new record date is set for the adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established. In the
event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, it is expected that the special meeting will be adjourned or recessed.

Attendance 

        Only stockholders of record or their duly authorized proxies or beneficial owners with proof of ownership have the right to attend the
special meeting. If your shares of Company common stock are held through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, please bring to the
special meeting a copy of your brokerage statement evidencing your beneficial ownership of Company common stock. If you are the
representative of a corporate or institutional stockholder, you must present proof that you are the representative of such stockholder.

Vote Required 

        Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company common stock entitled to vote thereon as of the record date. For the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you may
vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." Voting "ABSTAIN" will not be counted as a vote cast in favor of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement but will count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. If you fail to submit a proxy or to vote in
person at the special meeting, or if you vote "ABSTAIN," it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.

        If your shares of Company common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company,
N.A., you are considered, with respect to those shares of Company common stock, the "stockholder of record." This proxy statement and
proxy card have been sent directly to you by the Company.

        If your shares of Company common stock are held through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial
owner of shares of Company common stock held in "street name." In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares of Company common stock, the stockholder of record. As the
beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock held in "street name," you have the right to direct your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. If you hold your shares of Company common stock in "street
name," please contact your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee for their instructions on how to vote your shares. Please note that if you are
a beneficial owner of shares of Company common stock held in "street name" and wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you must
provide a legal proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee at the special meeting.

        Under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold shares in "street name" for customers
have the authority to vote on "discretionary" proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks,
brokerage firms or other nominees are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to approving non-discretionary matters,
such as the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, the proposal to approve the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute"
compensation and the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, and, as a result,
absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares of Company common stock, banks, brokerage firms or other nominees
are not empowered to vote those shares of Company common stock on non-discretionary matters. Shares held by banks, brokerage firms or
nominees that are present in person or by proxy at the special meeting but with respect to which the broker or other stockholder of record is
not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have discretionary voting
power on such proposal are referred generally as "broker non-votes." These broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining a
quorum, but will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Because none of the proposals to be
voted on at the special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, the Company does not expect
any broker non-votes at the special meeting.

        Approval of the advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation and approval of the proposal to approve one or more
adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, require a majority of the votes cast on each of these proposals. For the
nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation and the

proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate if there are insufficient votes at the time of
the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." For
purposes of each of these proposals, if you fail to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the special meeting, or if you have given a proxy and
vote "ABSTAIN," the shares of Company common stock will not be counted in respect of, and will not have any effect on, the proposal.

        If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares of Company common stock, or have such shares voted, on matters
presented at the special meeting in any of the following ways:

• in person—you may attend the special meeting and cast your vote there; or 

• by proxy—stockholders of record have a choice of having their shares voted by proxy by submitting a proxy in one of the
following ways: 

• over the Internet—the website for Internet proxy submission is on your proxy card; 

• by using a toll-free telephone number noted on your proxy card; or 

• by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope.

        If you are a beneficial owner of Company common stock held in "street name," you will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage
firm or other nominee that you must follow in order to have your shares of Company common stock voted. Those instructions will identify
which of the above choices are available to you in order to have your shares voted. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner of Company
common stock held in "street name" and wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you must provide a legal proxy from your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee.

        A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to submit a proxy for your shares of
Company common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when submitting a proxy over the Internet
or by telephone.

        Please refer to the instructions on your proxy or voting instruction card to determine the deadlines for submitting a proxy over the
Internet or by telephone. If you choose to submit your proxy by mailing a proxy card, your proxy card must be received by our Secretary by
the time the special meeting begins. Please do not send in your stock certificates with your proxy card. Following the consummation of
the merger, a separate letter of transmittal will be mailed to you that will enable you to surrender your stock certificates and receive the per
share merger consideration.

        If you vote by proxy, regardless of the method you choose to submit a proxy, the individuals named as your proxies on the enclosed
proxy card, and each of them, with full power of substitution, will vote your shares of Company common stock in the way that you indicate.
When completing the Internet or telephone proxy processes or the enclosed proxy card, you may specify whether your shares of Company
common stock should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before
the special meeting.

        If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares of Company common stock should be voted on
a matter, the shares of Company common stock represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted "FOR" the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement, "FOR" approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation and "FOR" the proposal
to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        If you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares, please call D.F. King, our proxy solicitor, toll-free at (866) 796-7179.

        IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU SUBMIT A PROXY FOR YOUR SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK PROMPTLY,
WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL MEETING. PLEASE COMPLETE, DATE, SIGN AND RETURN,
AS PROMPTLY AS POSSIBLE, THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD IN THE ACCOMPANYING PREPAID REPLY ENVELOPE,
OR SUBMIT YOUR PROXY BY TELEPHONE OR THE INTERNET. STOCKHOLDERS WHO ATTEND THE SPECIAL
MEETING MAY REVOKE THEIR PROXIES BY VOTING IN PERSON.

Shares Owned by Our Directors and Executive Officers 

        As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
1,915,031 shares of Company common stock, representing 0.3% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock on the record date. The
directors and executive officers have informed the Company that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of Company common stock
"FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, "FOR" approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute"
compensation and "FOR" the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Proxies and Revocation 

        Any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may submit a proxy by telephone, over the Internet, or by returning the
enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or may vote in person at the special meeting. If your shares of Company
common stock are held in "street name" by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee on how to vote your shares of Company common stock using the instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee. If you fail to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the special meeting, or if you vote "ABSTAIN," or if you do not provide your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee with voting instructions, your shares of Company common stock will not be voted on the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement, which will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        You have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered over the Internet, by telephone or by mail, at any time before it is exercised, by
submitting a later-dated proxy through any of the methods available to you, by giving written notice of revocation to our Secretary, which
must be received by the Company at Five Hundred Staples Drive, Framingham, Massachusetts 01702 by the time the special meeting begins,
or by attending the special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the special meeting alone will not revoke your proxy.

Adjournments and Recesses 

        Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned or recessed, including for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies, if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or if a quorum
is not present at the special meeting. Other than an announcement to be made at the special meeting of the time, date and place of an
adjourned meeting, an adjournment generally may be made without notice. Any adjournment or recess of the special meeting for the purpose
of soliciting additional proxies will allow the Company's stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior
to their use at the special meeting as adjourned or recessed.

Appraisal Rights 

        If the merger is completed, record holders of Company common stock as of the record date who submit a written demand for appraisal
before the vote is taken on the adoption of the merger agreement, do not fail to perfect or otherwise effectively withdraw their demand or
waive or lose the right to appraisal, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, hold their shares of Company common stock
continuously through the effective time of the merger and otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may
elect to pursue their appraisal rights to receive, in lieu of the $10.25 per share merger consideration, an amount in cash equal to the judicially
determined "fair value" of their shares, which fair value will be determined as of the effective time of the merger and could be more or less
than, or the same as, the per share merger consideration for the common stock. For a summary of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL, see "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 138. An executed proxy that is not marked "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" will be voted
"FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement and the stockholder submitting that proxy will lose the right to seek an appraisal of his, her or
its shares of Company common stock.

        A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex D to this proxy statement. Failure to follow the procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. We encourage you to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety.

        ANY COMPANY STOCKHOLDER WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS OR WHO WISHES TO PRESERVE HIS,
HER OR ITS RIGHT TO DO SO SHOULD REVIEW ANNEX D CAREFULLY AND SHOULD CONSULT HIS, HER OR ITS LEGAL
ADVISOR, SINCE FAILURE TO TIMELY AND FULLY COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH THEREIN WILL RESULT
IN THE LOSS OF SUCH RIGHTS.

Solicitation of Proxies; Payment of Solicitation Expenses 

        The Company has engaged D.F. King to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. The Company estimates that it will
pay D.F. King a fee of approximately $17,500. The Company will also reimburse D.F. King for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will
indemnify D.F. King and its affiliates against certain claims, expenses, losses, damages, liabilities and judgments. The Company may also
reimburse brokers, banks and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of shares of Company common stock
for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of Company common stock and in obtaining voting instructions
from those owners. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the Internet or in
person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.

THE MERGER 

        This discussion of the merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement
as Annex A. You should read the entire merger agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the merger.

        The merger agreement provides that Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company. The Company will be the surviving corporation
in the merger and will continue to do business following the merger. As a result of the merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded
company. You will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation.

Overview of the Merger 

        The Company, Parent and Merger Sub entered into the merger agreement on June 28, 2017. Under the terms of the merger agreement,
Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.
Parent and Merger Sub are beneficially owned by investment funds affiliated with Sycamore. In connection with the merger, each share of
Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than the dissenting shares and the
cancelled shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration, without interest and subject to
deduction for any required withholding tax.

        Following and as a result of the merger:

• Company stockholders will no longer have any interest in, and will no longer be stockholders of, the Company, and will not
participate in any of the Company's future earnings or growth; 

• shares of Company common stock will no longer be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and price quotations with respect to
shares of Company common stock in the public market will no longer be available; and 

• the registration of shares of Company common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated.

Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation 

        The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the initial directors of the surviving
corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the initial officers of the surviving
corporation.

Background of the Merger 

        The Board, together with members of the Company's senior management, regularly reviews and assesses the Company's business and
competitive landscape and periodically reviews and assesses strategic alternatives available to enhance value to stockholders.

        On August 15, 2016, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Barclays and
Morgan Stanley present for certain portions. Barclays has been a long-time financial advisor to the Company and Morgan Stanley had been
retained by the Board earlier in 2016 to assist in reviewing the Company's strategic alternatives in the event that the Company's announced
merger with Office Depot, Inc. were not consummated. At the meeting, the Board reviewed the challenging market environment for, and the
declining performance of, the Company's retail business. The Board also reviewed, with the assistance of Barclays and Morgan Stanley,
various strategic alternatives for the Company's North American retail business and the Company as a whole, including the continued
execution of the Company's business plan as an independent company; a spin-off of the retail business to stockholders; a spin-off and
concurrent sale of the retail business to

Party A, a potential strategic buyer in the Company's industry; a sale of the retail business; and a sale of the Company. The Company's Chief
Legal Officer discussed certain antitrust risks of transacting with Party A. The Board, with Barclays and Morgan Stanley, then discussed the
limited number of strategic buyers participating in the Company's industry and the low likelihood that any of them would be interested in such
an acquisition in view of their strategic direction or the absence of a compelling strategic rationale for such an acquisition. The Board
determined to continue to explore the available strategic alternatives and authorized management to hold preliminary exploratory discussions
with Party A and three identified potential financial buyers, Parties B, C and D, that the Board believed would be potentially interested in, and
capable of, executing a transaction with the Company.

        On August 18, 2016, Ms. Shira Goodman, the then interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company (who was appointed Chief
Executive Officer in September 2016), reached out to the Chief Executive Officer of Party A to schedule a meeting. A meeting was ultimately
scheduled for September 8, 2016.

        On August 24, 2016, Ms. Goodman and Ms. Christine Komola, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, held preliminary
exploratory discussions with Party B, a financial buyer.

        On September 2, 2016, Ms. Goodman and Ms. Komola held preliminary exploratory discussions with Party C, a financial buyer.

        On or about September 2, 2016, the Company and Party A entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement, which included a reciprocal
12-month standstill provision that would terminate, as to Party A, upon the signing of a definitive agreement with a third party for the sale of
the Company.

        On September 8, 2016, Ms. Goodman and Ms. Komola met with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Party A and
discussed in general terms a possible acquisition of the Company's North American retail business. At the meeting, Party A indicated that it
would be interested in exploring such an acquisition, particularly if it included the Staples brand and website URL.

        On September 13, 2016, the Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Barclays and Morgan
Stanley present for certain portions. At the meeting, the Board reviewed possible strategic alternatives, including continued execution of the
Company's business plan as an independent company; a spin-off of the retail business to stockholders; a spin-off and concurrent sale of the
Company's retail business to Party A; a sale of the Company's retail business; and a sale of the Company as a whole. The Board discussed the
interest of Party A in a possible transaction and determined that the Company would not be interested in including the Staples brand or
website URL in any sale of its retail business in view of the adverse impact such sale would have on the Company's remaining business. The
Company's Chief Legal Officer reviewed certain antitrust risks relating to any such transaction. After reviewing the strategic alternatives, the
Board authorized management to continue to explore the potential separation of the Company's retail business and also authorized
management to continue to hold exploratory meetings with the three identified financial buyers that the Board believed would be potentially
interested in, and capable of, executing a transaction with the Company.

        On September 14, 2016, Ms. Goodman communicated to the Chief Executive Officer of Party A that the Board was interested in
exploring a possible sale of the Company's retail business if it were not to include the Staples brand or website URL.

        On September 23, 2016, the Chief Executive Officer of Party A communicated to Ms. Goodman that Party A would be interested in a
potential acquisition of the Company's retail business only if it were to include the Staples brand and website URL.

        On October 14, 2016, Ms. Goodman and Ms. Komola held preliminary exploratory discussions with Party D, a financial buyer.

        On October 24, 2016, the Company and Party C entered into a confidentiality agreement, which contained a 12-month standstill
obligation that would terminate upon the signing of a definitive agreement with a third party for the sale of the Company.

        On November 30, 2016, Ms. Komola, with representatives of Barclays, had preliminary discussions with management of Party A, and its
financial advisor, about the possible sale of the Company's retail business. At the meeting, Party A indicated that it would be interested in
acquiring the U.S. retail business but not the Canadian retail business. Following such discussions, both parties indicated that they would
further evaluate such a transaction.

        On December 6, 2016, the Board held a meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Barclays and Morgan
Stanley present for certain portions. At the meeting, the Board and management reviewed and discussed the continuing market challenges that
made it difficult to forecast the Company's future performance, including the secular decline in office products sales, the continuing shift in
customer preference from retail stores to online sales, and the increased competition from existing and new market participants. At the
meeting, the Board reviewed potential strategic alternatives, including continued execution of the Company's business plan as an independent
company; a spin-off of the Company's retail business to stockholders; a spin-off and concurrent sale of the Company's retail business to Party
A; a sale of the retail business; and a sale of the Company as a whole. The Board reviewed Party A's potential interest in an acquisition of the
Company's U.S. retail business if the Staples brand and website URL were included. Legal counsel reviewed certain antitrust risks relating to
any such acquisition, including an assessment of the likelihood of an extended review by federal or state governmental authorities. The Board
also reviewed specific potential financial buyers that it believed would be most likely to have both the financial capability and interest to
acquire the Company. The Board determined that the Company should continue to pursue discussions with Party A regarding the potential
sale of the U.S. retail business and also pursue discussions with a selected group of five identified financial buyers (Sycamore and Parties B,
C, D and E) regarding their potential interest in an acquisition of the Company.

        Following the December Board meeting, representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley approached the identified five potential
financial buyers to assess their interest in exploring a potential acquisition of the Company as a whole. Also, Ms. Komola informed the Chief
Financial Officer of Party A, and Barclays and Morgan Stanley informed the financial advisor to Party A, that the Board had authorized the
Company to share additional information with Party A to assist it in formulating a proposal to acquire the Company's U.S. retail business.

        On December 19, 2016, the Company entered into a Clean Room Agreement with Party A, pursuant to which the Company subsequently
provided to selected personnel of, and advisors to, Party A certain information concerning the Company's retail business.

        In late December, 2016 and early January, 2017, the Company and each of Sycamore, Party B, Party D and Party E, entered into
confidentiality agreements, which contained a 12-month standstill obligation that would terminate upon the signing of a definitive agreement
with a third party for the sale of the Company.

        On January 18 and 19, 2017, Ms. Goodman, Ms. Komola and Mr. Jeffrey Hall, the Company's Vice Chairman and Chief Administrative
Officer, together with representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley, met with each of the five identified financial buyers to discuss the
Company's business. Subsequent to these meetings, the Company furnished to each of those potential buyers additional information
concerning the Company's business to facilitate their assessment of the Company.

        On January 19, 2017, Party A submitted a non-binding preliminary indication of interest for two alternative potential transactions: an
acquisition of the Company's U.S. retail business, excluding the Staples brand and website URL, for $500 million in cash, or the acquisition
of the Company's U.S. retail business, including the Staples brand and website URL, in an all-stock transaction for shares

representing up to 15% ownership of Party A, in each case subject to numerous conditions, including the completion of diligence.

        On January 24, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Barclays and
Morgan Stanley present for certain portions. At the meeting, the Board reviewed the preliminary discussions that had taken place with the
identified five potential financial buyers and the preliminary non-binding indication of interest received from Party A for the acquisition of the
Company's U.S. retail business. Representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley reviewed and discussed certain financial aspects of the
proposals from Party A. After discussion, the Board determined that the proposals from Party A reflected valuations of the Company's U.S.
retail business that were too low to act upon and that any discussions with Party A should be put on hold while the Company explored further
the level of interest of potential financial buyers. The Board instructed Barclays and Morgan Stanley to convey to the financial advisor to
Party A that its proposals were too low to act upon. The Board also instructed management, and Barclays and Morgan Stanley, to continue to
pursue exploratory discussions with the identified five potential financial buyers. At the meeting, the Board also determined that it would be
advisable, for administrative convenience, to establish a transaction committee, comprised of at least three independent directors, to, among
other things, oversee and direct the process of exploring and considering a sale or other strategic transaction involving the Company if and
when further progress was made in the discussions with the potential bidders.

        Following the January 24th Board meeting, preliminary diligence calls were held between members of management, together with
representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley, and each of Sycamore, Party B, Party C and Party E.

        On February 16, 2017, the Board, by unanimous written consent, established a Transaction Committee, which we refer to as the
Transaction Committee or the Committee, comprised of four independent directors, Messrs. Robert Sulentic, Curtis Feeny, John Lundgren
and Paul Walsh, with power and authority to oversee and direct the process of exploring and considering a sale or other strategic transaction
involving the Company, with final approval of any such transaction to require action by the full Board.

        On February 17, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with a representative of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and
Dorr LLP, which we refer to as WilmerHale, counsel to the Company, present for certain portions. During the meeting, WilmerHale reviewed
with the Transaction Committee the scope of the Board resolutions establishing the Committee and the directors' fiduciary duties under
Delaware law. The Transaction Committee considered and approved a form of letter to be delivered to members of Staples management
instructing them that, among other things, there should be no discussions between management and potential buyers regarding employment,
compensation or equity participation of management in connection with any possible transaction until the Board determined that such
discussions were appropriate. The Transaction Committee also discussed the engagement of financial advisors and legal counsel in
connection with a potential transaction. After discussion, the Transaction Committee determined to retain Barclays and Morgan Stanley as
financial advisors to the Board, subject to a review of disclosures from Barclays and Morgan Stanley as to their respective relationships with
the identified potential bidders and also the negotiation of the terms of engagement. The Transaction Committee also determined to engage
special Delaware counsel to advise the Transaction Committee and the independent directors with regard to their fiduciary duties.

        Between February 15 and 21, 2017, Ms. Goodman and other members of management of the Company, with representatives of Barclays
and Morgan Stanley, held telephonic discussions with each of Sycamore, Party B, Party C, Party D and Party E to discuss the business of the
Company. Each of these potential buyers was also granted access to a virtual data room containing selected financial and business information
regarding the Company.

        On February 23 and 24, 2017, Sycamore, Party B, Party C and Party E each submitted to the Company preliminary, non-binding
indications of interest for a potential transaction, subject to various conditions, including the completion of diligence. Sycamore submitted a
proposal to acquire the Company for a price of $11.00 per share in cash and indicated that it would require financial support from its limited
partners to complete an acquisition of the Company as a whole. Sycamore also submitted alternative proposals to acquire the Company's
North American retail business for $1.2 to $1.4 billion or the Company's U.S. retail business for $375 to $450 million. Party B submitted a
proposal to acquire the Company for a price of $11.15 to $11.55 per share in cash (including a $1.40 per share cash dividend) and also
expressed interest in alternative transactions, including participation in a leveraged recapitalization, an acquisition of the Company's North
American retail and online consumer business, potentially coupled with a corresponding investment in the remaining public company, or an
acquisition of the Company's North American delivery and international businesses concurrent with a sale of the Company's North American
retail business to a third party. Party C submitted a proposal to acquire the Company for a price of $11.00 to $11.50 per share in cash, and also
expressed interest in investing in the Company as a minority investor or purchasing the Company's North American delivery business. Party
C expressed in its proposal an intention to explore a concurrent or subsequent separation of all or part of the North American retail operations.
Party E submitted a proposal to acquire the Company for a price of $10.50 to $11.50 per share in cash. Party D declined to submit an
indication of interest and indicated it was not interested in continuing to pursue discussions regarding a potential transaction.

        On February 27, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives
of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP, which we refer to as Potter Anderson, present for certain
portions. At the meeting, representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley reviewed certain financial aspects of the proposals received from
Sycamore, Party B, Party C and Party E. It was noted that Party B had requested a 30-day period of exclusivity, which was rejected by the
Committee. Representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley informed the Committee that they had not been contacted by Party A regarding
a potential transaction with the Company since they had conveyed to Party A the Board's determination that its proposals to acquire the
Company's U.S. retail business were inadequate. After discussion, the Committee determined that the Company should allow Sycamore and
Parties B, C and E to continue to perform diligence on the Company with the goal of obtaining firmer and higher bids for the sale of the
Company. The Committee then began a discussion as to whether there were other potential strategic bidders that should be included in the
Company's strategic process. The Committee also determined to retain Potter Anderson as special Delaware counsel. The Committee also
discussed the prior relationships of Barclays and Morgan Stanley with the Company. Specifically, it was noted that Barclays had served as
financial advisor to the Company in connection with its 2015 merger agreement with Office Depot, which was subsequently terminated, and
the sales of the Company's U.K. and European businesses in 2016. It was also noted that Morgan Stanley had been engaged by the Board in
February 2016 to assist in a review of the Company's strategic alternatives and had also been engaged in 2016 to serve as financial advisor to
the Company in connection with the sale of the Company's Australia and New Zealand businesses. After discussion, the Committee
determined that it would retain Barclays and Morgan Stanley as financial advisors to the Board in connection with a potential strategic
transaction, subject to review of disclosures as to the relationships of such advisors with the potential bidders and negotiation of satisfactory
terms of engagement.

        On March 1, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays and Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. During the meeting, representatives of Barclays
and Morgan Stanley reviewed certain financial aspects of a potential sale of the Company's U.S. retail business to Party A. Legal counsel
reviewed potential U.S. antitrust issues that could arise from any sale of the Company's U.S. retail business to Party A. Management of the
Company also discussed certain operational issues

relating to the separation of the U.S. retail business from the remainder of the Company. After discussion, the Committee determined to
continue to explore with financial buyers the potential sale of the Company as a whole and to evaluate later in the process whether to re-
engage with Party A regarding a possible sale of the U.S. retail business.

        On March 5, 2017, the Transaction Committee held an in-person meeting, with Potter Anderson present for certain portions. A
representative of Potter Anderson reviewed for the Committee their fiduciary duties in considering strategic alternatives and also reviewed
possible processes and timelines for a potential transaction.

        On March 6, 2017, the Transaction Committee held an in-person meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. At the meeting, representatives of Barclays and
Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Committee the Company's outreach to third parties with respect to a potential transaction, the preliminary
non-binding indications of interest received by the Company, and certain financial aspects of such indications of interest. Representatives of
Barclays and Morgan Stanley also reviewed with the Committee the limited number of potential strategic buyers. After discussion, it was the
consensus of the Committee that the Company should not contact any of such strategic buyers because of the low likelihood that any of such
strategic buyers would be interested in a transaction with the Company (in view of their strategic direction or the absence of a compelling
strategic rationale for such a transaction) and because, in light of that low likelihood, it would be inadvisable to risk the identified financial
buyers becoming unwilling to continue to devote the time and resources necessary to perform diligence on the Company if it became known
that potential strategic buyers were included in the sale process. The Committee also discussed the competitive risks of sharing confidential
information with strategic buyers not likely to be bidders.

        On March 6 and 7, 2017, the Board held an in-person meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Barclays,
Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. At the meeting, representatives of WilmerHale and Potter
Anderson reviewed with the directors their fiduciary responsibilities in considering strategic alternatives, as well as various ways in which a
sale process might be conducted to comply with such duties, including through a pre-signing market check. The Board reviewed the
indications of interest received from Sycamore, Party B, Party C and Party E on February 23 and 24, as well as the indications of interest
received from Party A on January 19. Representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley reviewed certain financial aspects of each of the
proposals. The Board then discussed the Company's current and forecasted financial performance and the risks and uncertainties associated
with its forecasts, including the Company's difficulty, during the last five years, meeting its financial guidance due, in large part, to
challenging market conditions and trends. The Board also reviewed potential upside opportunities for the Company's initiatives to increase
revenues and profitability, including the initiatives relating to potential tuck-in acquisitions, increased focus on the mid-market, reductions in
operating costs and accelerated growth of products other than office supplies. (See "—Company Financial Forecasts; Other Company
Information.") After discussion, the Board and management concluded that management should continue to develop such upside
opportunities and share them with the financial bidders, but that they were too speculative, and subject to too many risks and uncertainties, to
include in the Company's financial forecasts. The Board then discussed the strategic alternatives available to the Company, including
continuing to execute its business as an independent company, a sale of its retail business and a sale of the Company as a whole. The Board
reviewed, with its financial and legal advisors, the potential execution, antitrust and business risks associated with a sale of the Company's
retail business, the significant time that would be required to complete a separation of the retail business and the risks and uncertainties of
retaining and operating its contract delivery business. Representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley then reviewed with the Board the
strategic buyers that might be potentially interested in an acquisition of the Company. After discussion, the Board concurred with the
recommendation of the Transaction Committee not to contact any of the strategic buyers

because of the low likelihood that any of such strategic buyers would be interested in a transaction with the Company and because, in light of
that low likelihood, it would be inadvisable to risk the identified financial buyers becoming unwilling to continue to devote the time and
resources necessary to perform diligence on the Company if it became known that potential strategic buyers were included in the sale process.
The Board also discussed the competitive risks of sharing confidential information with strategic buyers that were not likely to be bidders.
The Board determined that the Company should allow each of the financial buyers to perform further diligence regarding the Company and
should continue to pursue discussions with each of them for a transaction involving the sale of the Company as a whole.

        On March 17, 2017, the Company provided Sycamore, Party B, Party C and Party E with access to additional financial and business
information of the Company in the virtual data room.

        On March 20, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. A representative of Barclays reviewed with the Committee the status
of the diligence efforts of the bidders. Barclays also discussed the request by Party C that it be permitted to partner with Party D to submit a
bid to acquire the Company. After discussion of the risks and benefits of such request, the Committee determined it would permit Party C to
work with Party D to submit a joint bid. Barclays also discussed an unsolicited inbound call from an additional potential financial buyer,
Party F, inquiring about a possible sale process of the Company, and the Committee authorized Barclays and Morgan Stanley to follow-up
with Party F to assess its level of interest in acquiring the Company.

        On March 27, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley
updated the Committee regarding their discussions with Party F, in which Party F indicated it would not be interested in submitting a proposal
to acquire the Company as they did not view the acquisition opportunity as compelling in view of the business risks. Barclays and Morgan
Stanley also provided an update with respect to the diligence efforts of the other bidders.

        On April 3, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley
updated the Committee regarding their discussions with the bidders, including that Party C and Party D had agreed to work together for the
purposes of submitting a joint bid to acquire the Company. The Committee also discussed the disclosures provided by Barclays and Morgan
Stanley regarding their respective relationships with the Company and each of the bidders participating in the strategic alternatives process.
The Committee determined that such relationships would not impair the ability of either Barclays or Morgan Stanley to provide impartial
advice to the Board and reconfirmed its determination to engage Barclays and Morgan Stanley as financial advisors to the Board, subject to
completion of their respective engagement letters. At the meeting, Mr. Lundgren reported that he had received inquiries from two search firms
seeking to ascertain whether he would be interested in exploring certain positions with Party C, to which Mr. Lundgren had replied that he
was not in a position to discuss serving in any such capacity at this time.

        From April 3 to April 20, 2017, management of the Company, with representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley, participated in full
day, in-person diligence sessions with each of Sycamore, Party B, Parties C and D, and Party E.

        On April 4, 2017, an article in The Wall Street Journal reported that the Company was exploring a potential sale to a number of financial
buyers. On April 3, 2017, the closing price for Company common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market was $8.66 per share.

        On April 4, 2017, the Company entered into engagement letters with Barclays and Morgan Stanley to serve as financial advisors to the
Board of Directors in connection with a potential transaction.

        On April 6, 2017, after discussions with Mr. Sulentic and WilmerHale, Mr. Lundgren resigned from the Transaction Committee in order
to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest as a result of the inquiries he had received regarding his potential interest in a
position with Party C.

        On April 10, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. At the meeting, representatives of Barclays and
Morgan Stanley discussed an inbound call from Party G, a potential financial buyer, inquiring about the sale process being undertaken by the
Company in light of press reports, and the Committee instructed Barclays and Morgan Stanley to follow-up with Party G to assess its level of
interest in participating in the process. Barclays and Morgan Stanley also reported on the diligence efforts of the bidders.

        Following the publication of The Wall Street Journal article, the financial advisor to Party A contacted Barclays and Morgan Stanley and
reiterated the proposals made by Party A in January 2017.

        On April 17, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. At the meeting, representatives of Barclays and
Morgan Stanley updated the Committee as to the bidders' diligence efforts and also reported that Party G had informed Barclays and Morgan
Stanley that it would not be interested in making a proposal to acquire the whole Company, but might be interested in an acquisition of the
Company's contract delivery business. Barclays and Morgan Stanley then reported on the inbound call from the financial advisor to Party A,
and the Committee discussed the potential benefits and risks of a transaction with Party A.

        On April 24, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. During the meeting, representatives of Barclays and
Morgan Stanley updated the Committee on the continued diligence of the bidders and discussed next steps in the process, including a
proposed date of May 22, 2017 for bidders to submit revised bids. In addition, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson provided a summary of, and
there was discussion regarding, the material terms of the form of merger agreement to be provided to the bidders, which terms were designed
to provide for certainty of closing and to enable the Board effectively to respond to unsolicited third party acquisition proposals. The
Committee discussed, among other things, a proposed termination fee of 2.5% of the equity value of the Company to be paid by the Company
in the event of a determination by the Board to pursue or accept a superior proposal, which we refer to as the Company Termination Fee, a
proposed reverse termination fee of 7% of the equity value of the Company to be paid by the buyer if the buyer were unable to close by
reason of, among other things, an inability to obtain debt financing, which we refer to as the Buyer Termination Fee, the provisions relating to
the Company's ability to solicit and respond to acquisition proposals, the definition of "Material Adverse Effect," the interim operating
covenants and the acceleration of outstanding unvested equity awards 180 days after the closing.

        On April 30, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. At the meeting, representatives of Barclays and
Morgan Stanley updated the Committee regarding their communications with the bidders, including a request by Party B for additional time
beyond May 22, 2017 to submit a final bid in order to complete its diligence. Barclays and Morgan Stanley also discussed an inbound call
from Party A's financial advisor, in which the advisor reaffirmed the proposals made by Party A in January 2017. There was discussion about
concerns expressed by the bidders as to the achievability of the upside opportunities from management's growth and profit improvement
initiatives, and management informed the Committee

that they were working to provide information that could demonstrate their potential achievability. The Committee then discussed the
advisability of approaching additional strategic buyers in the sales process or approaching one or more of the financial bidders regarding a
sale of only the retail business of the Company. After discussion, the Committee determined not to extend the proposed bid deadline for Party
B in view of the risk that such an extension would be harmful to maintaining the competitive nature of the process for the other bidders. The
Committee noted that no strategic buyers had approached the Company or its financial advisors even after the April 4th Wall Street Journal
article concerning a possible sale of the Company and, after discussion, determined not to approach potential strategic buyers or to reconsider
a possible sale of the Company's retail business for the reasons discussed at the March 6th-7th Board meeting.

        On May 1, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Barclays, Morgan
Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley reviewed the sale
process to date and the status of the bidders' diligence efforts, as well as the reiteration of Party A's January 2017 proposal by its financial
advisor. It was noted that there had been no substantial inbound expressions of interest from new prospective buyers even after the publication
of The Wall Street Journal article other than the approach by Party G. Members of the Committee reviewed for the Board the determinations
of the Committee not to extend the proposed bid deadline for Party B and not to approach potential strategic buyers or to reconsider the
possible sale of the Company's retail business, and the Board concurred with such determinations.

        On May 1, 2017, Barclays and Morgan Stanley delivered a process letter to Sycamore, Party B, Parties C and D, and Party E, including a
form of proposed merger agreement, consistent with the material terms discussed with the Board on April 24, 2017, and requested final
proposals for the acquisition of the Company, and a mark-up of the merger agreement, by May 22, 2017.

        On May 2, 2017, an article in Reuters reported that a number of financial buyers were exploring an acquisition of the Company.

        Also on May 2, 2017, Party E informed Barclays and Morgan Stanley that it would require eight to 10 weeks of extensive additional
diligence in order to submit a final bid and that it was not in a position to indicate what its offered price would be or whether it would be
within the indicative price range provided to the Company in February 2017.

        On May 3, 2017, Parties C and D indicated that they were no longer interested in a transaction with the Company because they did not
view a potential acquisition as an attractive enough investment opportunity to pursue.

        On May 8, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. During the meeting, representatives of Barclays and
Morgan Stanley reported that Parties C and D had informed them that they would not be proceeding further in the sale process and that Party
E had indicated it would need up to 10 weeks to submit a bid. After discussion, the Committee determined not to extend the deadline for Party
E because of the potential adverse effects on the competitive nature of the sale process and because the Committee was concerned about the
potential significant disruption to the Company's business that would be caused by an extension of the sale process. Barclays and Morgan
Stanley also reported that they had received another inbound call from Party A's financial advisor, in which the advisor indicated that Party A
remained interested in pursuing an acquisition of the Company's U.S. retail operations and that the chief executive officers of the two
companies should meet to discuss a possible acquisition. The Committee determined that such meeting should take place with Party A after
the Company's receipt of the final round of bids on or about May 22, 2017.

        During the weeks of May 8 and May 15, 2017, management of the Company, with representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley,
conducted multiple additional diligence sessions with Sycamore and Party B.

        On May 15, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley
provided an update regarding the diligence efforts of Sycamore and Party B. Barclays and Morgan Stanley also reported that they had
received inbound calls from a foreign strategic buyer, which they believed lacked sufficient financial resources and a sufficient acquisition
track record to likely be a credible bidder, and from a financial buyer, which they believed would likely not have the financial resources to, or
interest in, buying the whole Company. After discussion, the Committee determined not to engage with either party at that time.
Ms. Goodman reported that she, Ms. Komola and Mr. Hall were scheduled to meet with Party A on May 30, 2017.

        On May 22, 2017, Sycamore submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for a price of $11.50 per share in cash and Party
B submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire the Company for $10.25 per share in cash, in each case subject to conditions including
additional diligence. Both proposals were for a merger that would contain no financing condition. Sycamore submitted draft financing
commitments from three financial institutions and indicated that the equity financing would be provided by Sycamore and certain of its
limited partners. Party B submitted highly confident letters from three financial institutions and stated that other subordinated debt financing
would be provided by Party B and two other institutional investors in approximately equal proportions. Both Sycamore and Party B submitted
preliminary comments on the draft merger agreement.

        On May 23, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. At the meeting, representatives of Barclays and
Morgan Stanley reviewed the proposals received on May 22nd and certain financial aspects of the proposals. The Committee and its financial
advisors noted that Sycamore had not done as much diligence as Party B and were concerned that Sycamore would not maintain its $11.50
offer price through the signing of a definitive merger agreement and believed it would therefore be beneficial to continue to engage with both
bidders. After discussion, the Committee determined that Barclays and Morgan Stanley should inform Party B that its bid was lower than
another bid and that it should work to increase its price. The Committee also determined that the Company should work with Sycamore so
that it could complete its diligence process as expeditiously as possible and that the financial advisors should convey to Sycamore that the
Committee would be prepared to recommend a transaction at the proposed price to the Board, subject to the completion of diligence,
satisfactory negotiation of definitive transaction documents and receipt of a firm bid (including the necessary equity and debt financing
commitments) by mid-June.

        Later on May 23, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with senior management and representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley,
WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley reviewed the revised
proposals of Sycamore and Party B and discussed with the Board certain financial aspects of the proposals. After discussion, the Board
concurred with the messages to both bidders recommended by the Transaction Committee.

        Following the Board meeting, representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley conveyed to Sycamore and Party B the messages
approved by the Board.

        Following the Board meeting, members of the Transaction Committee discussed that Party C was no longer part of the sale process and
that therefore the participation of Mr. Lundgren would no longer create the risk of an appearance of a potential conflict of interest. The
Committee determined

that it would benefit from Mr. Lundgren's experience and, accordingly, invited Mr. Lundgren to attend future Committee meetings as an
observer.

        On May 30, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Mr. Lundgren also attended. At the meeting,
representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley discussed their communications with Sycamore and Party B, the fact that Party B appeared to
remain ahead of Sycamore in its diligence and the expected time required by each bidder to be in a position to submit a final bid. The
Committee instructed Barclays and Morgan Stanley to confirm Sycamore's ability to obtain the necessary equity and debt financing
commitments for an acquisition and to continue discussions with Party B but convey that its valuation of the Company needed to be increased
to be competitive.

        Later on May 30, 2017, Ms. Goodman, Ms. Komola and Mr. Hall met with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of
Party A to discuss further the potential sale of the Company's U.S. retail business. At the meeting, Party A indicated it would present in early
June a non-binding proposal to acquire the Company's U.S. retail business without the Staples brand.

        From May 31 to June 6, 2017, management of the Company, with representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley, held further diligence
discussions with both Sycamore and Party B.

        On June 4, 2017, Party B submitted a revised proposal to acquire the Company for a price of $10.50 per share in cash and requested an
exclusivity period of three weeks to complete its diligence process and negotiate a definitive merger agreement with the Company.

        On June 5, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Mr. Lundgren also attended. At the meeting,
representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley discussed their communications with the bidders since the Committee's last meeting,
including the revised proposal by Party B to acquire the Company at a price of $10.50 per share and its request for exclusivity, which request
for exclusivity was rejected by the Committee. Ms. Goodman also discussed the May 30th meeting with Party A.

        Later on June 5, 2017, Party A submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire the Company's U.S. retail business, excluding rights to the
Staples brand and website URL, for cash consideration of $625 million to $700 million. The non-binding proposal was subject to numerous
conditions, including the completion of diligence.

        From June 7 to June 26, 2017, management of the Company, with representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley, continued to hold
diligence sessions with Sycamore.

        On June 8, 2017, Party B informed Barclays and Morgan Stanley that it was no longer interested in pursuing a transaction with the
Company, and, after Barclays and Morgan Stanley inquired whether Party B would be interested in proceeding at its previous proposed price
of $10.25 per share, Party B indicated that it would not be interested in proceeding at that price or even a lower price.

        On June 10, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Mr. Lundgren also attended. At the meeting,
representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley reported on Party B's decision to withdraw from the process. Barclays and Morgan Stanley
also updated the Committee regarding the continued diligence efforts of Sycamore. They also reported that representatives of Sycamore had
confirmed that the financial institutions providing the debt financing for Sycamore were committed to financing an acquisition of the
Company as a whole. Finally, Barclays and Morgan Stanley reported that they were reviewing the revised proposal received from Party A to
acquire the Company's U.S. retail business.

        On June 11, 2017, Sycamore submitted a revised proposal to acquire the Company at a price of $11.00 per share, together with updated
unsigned financing commitment letters from three financial institutions for funded indebtedness of up to $5.3 billion and an indication that
Sycamore would be prepared to commit equity financing of up to $1.7 billion. The proposal also included signed letters of intent for up to a
total of $1.425 billion in equity commitments from five limited partners of Sycamore. Sycamore also submitted a full mark-up of the merger
agreement. Sycamore indicated it would be ready to sign a definitive merger agreement as expeditiously as possible, subject to confirmatory
diligence, and also indicated that it would require expense reimbursement agreement of up to $5 million in order to continue in the process.

        On June 12, 2017, the Transaction Committee held an in-person meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Mr. Lundgren also attended. Representatives of
Barclays and Morgan Stanley discussed the most recent proposal from Party A and the revised proposal from Sycamore to acquire the
Company at a price of $11.00 per share in cash, subject to the completion of confirmatory diligence. Barclays and Morgan Stanley reviewed
and discussed certain financial aspects of Sycamore's proposal. The Committee and its advisors also discussed the expense reimbursement
request by Sycamore in its revised proposal. WilmerHale provided a summary of the revisions to the draft merger agreement proposed by
Sycamore. In considering the proposal by Party A to acquire the Company's U.S. retail business, and the possibility of seeking to sell the
Company's retail business to another buyer, the Committee reviewed preliminary illustrative ranges of hypothetical values for three
hypothetical scenarios for the sale of the Company's U.S. retail business or North American retail business and the Company's continued
operation of the remainder of its business as a stand-alone company, based on numerous assumptions provided by management. (See "The
Merger—Company Financial Forecasts; Other Company Information—Other Company Information.") The Committee also considered the
time, complexity and potential antitrust issues and business disruption that would be involved in the sale of the Company's retail business, and
the risks, uncertainties and incremental costs of continuing to operate the Company's remaining business as a stand-alone company, including
the risks relating to the secular decline in sales of office products and increasing competitive threats. After considering all of these factors, and
the proposals received to date to acquire the Company's retail business, the Committee determined to recommend to the Board that the
continued pursuit of a sale of the Company as a whole would be the best available alternative for stockholders of the Company.

        On June 12, 2017, the Board held an in-person meeting, with members of senior management, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale
and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley reviewed the activities with the various
bidders since the May 23rd Board meeting and also reviewed the terms of the most recent proposal from Sycamore to acquire the Company
for $11.00 per share and the most recent proposal from Party A to acquire the U.S. retail business for $625 million to $700 million in cash.
Barclays and Morgan Stanley reviewed and discussed with the Board certain financial aspects of the proposals from Sycamore and Party A.
The Committee then reviewed and discussed with the Board its recommendation that the Company should continue to pursue a sale of the
whole Company, and the Board concurred. Ms. Goodman then reviewed and discussed potential upside opportunities from management's
growth and profitability improvement initiatives shared with the financial bidders. The Board and management discussed the speculative
nature of those upside opportunities and determined that the Company's forecasts furnished to the bidders should not be revised to take into
account those upside opportunities in view of the risks and uncertainties of those upsides and also the risks and uncertainties of the forecasts
themselves as a result of the challenging market trends and competitive conditions. A representative of WilmerHale reviewed certain issues in
the mark-up of the merger agreement provided by Sycamore. WilmerHale also discussed that while Sycamore intended to separately finance
the Company's U.S. retail, Canadian retail, and North American contract delivery businesses concurrently with or immediately after the
closing of the proposed acquisition of the Company, Sycamore had confirmed that the separation of the

businesses would not be a condition to the closing of the proposed acquisition. The Board then discussed the request of Sycamore for expense
reimbursement of up to $5 million if Sycamore delivered a binding proposal (including financing commitments) at a price not less than
$11.00 per share on or before June 27, 2017 or, on or before July 31, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of the
Company to a third party or the Company terminated its process to pursue strategic alternatives. After discussion, the Board determined that it
would be appropriate for the Company to enter into an expense reimbursement agreement with Sycamore substantially on such terms.

        On June 14, 2017, the Company and Sycamore entered into an expense reimbursement agreement for up to $5 million on substantially
the terms proposed by Sycamore.

        From June 15 to June 28, 2017, representatives of WilmerHale and counsel to Sycamore, Kirkland & Ellis, LLP, which we refer to as
K&E, negotiated the terms of the definitive merger agreement, including the provisions relating to the ability of the Company to respond to
superior proposals, the information required to be provided by the Company to Sycamore in connection with its debt financing, the
restrictions on the Company's activities between signing and closing, the Company Termination Fee and Buyer Termination Fee and the scope
of the Company's obligation to provide commercially reasonable cooperation to Sycamore's review and planning for the separation of the
retail and contract delivery businesses.

        On June 19, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Mr. Lundgren also attended. At the meeting,
representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley updated the Committee regarding Sycamore's outstanding diligence items and the anticipated
timing for finalizing the transaction documents. The Committee then discussed the non-binding proposal from Party A to acquire the
Company's U.S. retail business, excluding the Staples brand and website URL, for $625 million to $700 million in cash. After discussion, the
Committee reaffirmed the determination of the Board at its June 12th meeting that the best available alternative for stockholders would be to
continue to pursue a sale of the Company as a whole and therefor the Company should inform Party A that the Committee was not willing to
pursue a sale of the U.S. retail business at the proposed value. The Committee also considered certain employee-related matters, including the
need for a retention award program to retain key employees, other than senior management, who would be instrumental during the period
prior to and immediately after the closing of a merger.

        On June 19, 2017, Barclays and Morgan Stanley informed the financial advisors to Party A that the Company was not interested in
selling its U.S. retail business at the valuation proposed by Party A.

        During the weeks of June 13 and June 19, 2017, management of the Company, with representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley,
continued to provide information to Sycamore in connection with its confirmatory diligence review of the Company.

        On June 21, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. At the meeting, the Committee and its financial and
legal advisors reviewed and discussed Sycamore's plan to separately finance the retail and contract delivery businesses concurrently with or
immediately after the closing of the acquisition of the Company, and, after discussion, the Committee reconfirmed its position that any
separation of the Company's businesses could not be a condition to the closing of the acquisition.

        On June 22, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Mr. Lundgren also attended. At the meeting,
representatives of Barclays, Morgan Stanley and WilmerHale updated the Committee on the status of discussions with Sycamore and K&E,
including with respect to the separation of the Company's retail and contract delivery

businesses, the status of Sycamore's financing commitments, and certain outstanding diligence issues that Sycamore had raised.

        On June 23, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Mr. Lundgren also attended. At the meeting,
WilmerHale summarized the terms of the debt financing commitment letters provided by Sycamore and the status of negotiations regarding
the merger agreement and financing commitment letters. The Committee also discussed with management the potential business disruption
and employee retention risks that could arise as a result of Sycamore's plans to separately finance the Company's businesses upon or
immediately after the closing and the need to formulate appropriate retention arrangements for key employees other than senior management
to address those risks.

        Later on June 23, 2017, Sycamore informed Barclays and Morgan Stanley that it was reducing its proposed acquisition price from $11.00
to $10.00 per share as a result of its further review of the Company's business and its current assessment of the Company's business and future
prospects. Also, K&E delivered to WilmerHale a revised draft of the merger agreement, which included, among other things, terms that
would add certain closing conditionality relating to Sycamore's plan to separately finance the Company's retail and contract delivery
businesses.

        In the morning on June 24, 2017, after discussions among members of the Transaction Committee and its financial and legal advisors
regarding the revised draft of the merger agreement delivered by K&E, Barclays and Morgan Stanley, on behalf of the Transaction
Committee, communicated to Sycamore that the Company was terminating any further discussions concerning a potential transaction, unless
and until a satisfactory resolution of the closing conditionality issues were reached.

        Later on June 24, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives
of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Mr. Lundgren also attended. At the meeting,
representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley reported on the reduction in the proposed purchase price to $10.00 per share. WilmerHale
then discussed the status of negotiations regarding the terms of the definitive merger agreement, including the terms relating to closing
conditionality. After discussion, the Committee instructed Barclays and Morgan Stanley that, if the merger agreement issues relating to
closing conditionality were satisfactorily resolved, they should seek from Sycamore a price higher than $10.00 price per share.

        Later on June 24, 2017, after discussions among Sycamore, K&E, Ms. Komola, Barclays, Morgan Stanley and WilmerHale, the issues
relating to closing conditionality were resolved to the satisfaction of the Committee and its advisors by the elimination of the terms objected
to in the June 23rd draft of the merger agreement provided by K&E.

        Later on June 24, 2017, representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley informed Sycamore that the Transaction Committee was not
prepared to recommend to the Board a transaction at a price of $10.00 per share.

        On June 25, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Barclays, Morgan
Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley updated the Board on
activities and discussions with Sycamore since the prior Board meeting on June 12 and reviewed the principal terms of Sycamore's most
recent proposal to acquire the Company for a price of $10.00 per share, as well as the debt and equity financing structure for the proposal.
WilmerHale reviewed the status of the negotiations regarding certain terms of the definitive merger agreement, including the closing
conditions and Sycamore's proposal that the Company Termination Fee and Buyer Termination Fee be 2% and 4%, respectively, of the
Company's equity value, and that the Company reimburse up to $25 million of Sycamore's expenses if the Company's stockholders do not
approve the Merger under

circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is not payable. Potter Anderson reviewed for the Board the fiduciary duties of the
directors in considering a potential sale of the Company or other strategic alternatives.

        Later on June 25, 2017, Sycamore informed Barclays and Morgan Stanley that it would increase its proposed purchase price from $10.00
to $10.15 per share.

        On June 26, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of
Barclays, Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Mr. Lundgren also attended. Representatives of
Barclays and Morgan Stanley updated the Committee on Sycamore's increased offer. WilmerHale discussed the status of the negotiations
related to the merger agreement. The Committee conveyed to its financial and legal advisors that the Buyer Termination Fee would need to be
meaningfully higher than 4%. After discussion, the Committee instructed Barclays and Morgan Stanley to seek the best and final price from
Sycamore as soon as possible and determined that it would consider a transaction with Sycamore only after receiving such best and final
price.

        Later on June 26, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Barclays,
Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Andersen present for certain portions. Representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley updated the
Board on the status of the discussions with Sycamore, and WilmerHale updated the board on the status of the negotiations on the definitive
merger agreement and financing commitments. The Board discussed the need to put in place appropriate retention arrangements to retain key
employees other than senior management between the signing of the merger agreement and at least the closing of the acquisition.

        On June 27, 2017, Sycamore conveyed to Barclays and Morgan Stanley its best and final price of $10.25 per share.

        Later on June 27, 2017, the Transaction Committee held a telephonic meeting, with senior management and representatives of Barclays,
Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale, and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. Mr. Lundgren also attended. Representatives of Barclays and
Morgan Stanley discussed Sycamore's best and final price of $10.25 per share. Barclays and Morgan Stanley then presented their financial
analyses of the proposed transaction with Sycamore. The financial advisors also reviewed the general structure and amounts of Sycamore's
equity and debt financing, including the equity co-investments by certain limited partners of Sycamore. WilmerHale reviewed the principal
terms of the merger agreement, including the Company Termination Fee of $171 million (approximately 2.5% of equity value), the Buyer
Termination Fee of $343 million (approximately 5% of equity value) and the reimbursement of up to $15 million of Sycamore's expenses if
the stockholders of the Company do not approve the merger under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is not payable.
WilmerHale also reviewed certain employee-related matters that were addressed in the merger agreement, including the Company's plans to
adopt an employee retention award program of up to $20 million for key employees other than senior management; to maintain its current
annual employee bonus plan through the end of fiscal year 2017 (with appropriate adjustments for the merger); to provide that the existing
severance agreements with officers and key employees cannot be terminated by the Company for two years following the merger; and to
reimburse certain officers for potential excess parachute payment tax liabilities, if any, arising from the merger. (See "The Merger—Interests
of Certain Persons in the Merger.") The Committee and its advisors discussed the timing and next steps for submitting the merger agreement
to the Board for consideration. Potter Anderson reviewed with the Committee the updated disclosures received from each of Barclays and
Morgan Stanley regarding certain relationships with Sycamore and the limited partners providing the equity co-investments. The Transaction
Committee then unanimously adopted resolutions approving, and recommending that the Board approve, the merger agreement, subject to the
finalization of the terms of the merger agreement and delivery of a fairness opinion to the Board by each of Barclays and Morgan Stanley.

        Later on June 27, 2017 the Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Barclays,
Morgan Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present for certain portions. The Transaction Committee reported that it had unanimously
approved, and recommended that the Board approve, the merger agreement, subject to the finalization of the terms of the definitive merger
agreement and delivery of a fairness opinion by each of Barclays and Morgan Stanley. Barclays and Morgan Stanley then presented their
financial analyses of the proposed transaction. (See "The Merger—Opinions of the Company's Financial Advisors.") The Board then reviewed
preliminary illustrative ranges of hypothetical values for three hypothetical scenarios for the sale of the Company's U.S. retail business or
North American retail business and the Company's continued operation of the remainder of its business as a stand-alone company, based on
numerous assumptions provided by management. (See "The Merger—Company Financial Forecasts; Other Company Information—Other
Company Information"). WilmerHale reviewed the principal terms of the definitive merger agreement. WilmerHale also reviewed for the
Board the employee-related issues discussed at the meeting of the Transaction Committee held prior to the Board meeting. WilmerHale also
reviewed a forum selection by-law amendment to be proposed for adoption by the Board upon the signing of the definitive merger agreement.
The Board then authorized its legal and financial advisors and management to continue to work toward finalizing the definitive merger
agreement and other transaction documents. The Board also authorized Ms. Goodman, with representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley,
to meet in-person later that evening with the principals of Sycamore to discuss the plans and goals of Sycamore for the Company's business,
as well as an internal and external communications strategy, but not to discuss the roles or compensation of management following the
merger.

        Later on June 27, 2017, Ms. Goodman, with representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley, met in person with the principals of
Sycamore to discuss Sycamore's plans and goals for the Company's business, as well as an internal and external communications strategy.

        On June 28, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting, with members of senior management and representatives of Barclays, Morgan
Stanley, WilmerHale and Potter Anderson present. A representative of WilmerHale reviewed the principal terms of the definitive merger
agreement between Sycamore and the Company, previously distributed to the directors, and the debt and equity commitment letters to be
furnished by Sycamore. Representatives of Barclays and Morgan Stanley reviewed their financial analyses of the $10.25 in cash per share of
Company Common Stock to be paid by Sycamore pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Barclays then orally rendered to the Board its opinion,
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based on and subject to factors
and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the $10.25 in cash per share to be offered to the holders of Company common stock (other than
holders of excluded shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Morgan Stanley then orally rendered to the Board its
opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based on and subject to
factors and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the $10.25 in cash per share to be received by the holders of Company common stock (other
than holders of excluded shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (See "The Merger—Opinions of the Company's
Financial Advisors.") After discussion, the Board unanimously voted to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger, to recommend the merger agreement to the Company's stockholders and to adopt the forum selection by-law
amendment.

        Later on June 28, 2017, the Company and Sycamore executed the merger agreement and issued a joint press release announcing the
transaction. Concurrently, Sycamore and the Co-Investors (defined below) executed and delivered the equity commitment letters and limited
guaranties, and the commitment parties executed and delivered the debt commitment letters.

Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board 

        At a meeting held on June 28, 2017, the Board, by a unanimous vote of all directors, (a) determined and declared that the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (b) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (c) declared that the terms of the merger are fair to the Company
and the Company's stockholders, and (d) determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company for the Board to submit the
merger agreement to the Company's stockholders for adoption and directed that the merger agreement be submitted to the Company's
stockholders at a special meeting of the Company's stockholders for their adoption, and recommended that the Company's stockholders adopt
the merger agreement.

        Before making its recommendation, the Board consulted with its outside legal and financial advisors and with the Company's senior
management team. In reaching its recommendation, the Board considered the following material factors that it believes support its decision to
enter into the merger agreement and consummate the merger (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):

• Best Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value.  The Board believed that receipt of the merger consideration of $10.25 per
share in cash was more favorable to the Company stockholders than the likely value that would result from other potential
transactions or remaining independent. This decision was based on, among other things, the Board's assessment of: 

• the Company's historical operating and financial performance, including that the Company had experienced declines in
sales in four of the past five fiscal years and that the Company, during the last five years, had difficulty meeting its
financial guidance due, in large part, to overall challenging market conditions and trends, the secular decline in office
products sales, the channel shift from retail to online sales and increased competition; 

• the Company's competitive position, including that it faced a growing and diverse set of competitors, including online
retailers, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, computer and electronics retail stores, specialty technology stores, print
and marketing businesses, and a wide range of other retailers; 

• the Company's future prospects, including risks related to achieving the revenue growth and profitability reflected in
the Company's financial projections as a standalone company and the risks inherent in the Company's industry,
including the competitive threat of new market entrants, especially in the contract delivery business; the migration of
consumers and businesses from printed to digital media and communications with the resultant reduction in sales of
office supplies and the need to successfully expand other products and services sold at acceptable margins; the ability
to shrink the Company's excess retail presence while maintaining acceptable profitability levels; and the various
additional risks and uncertainties that are described in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed
with the SEC; 

• the possible alternatives to a sale of the entire Company, including continuing as a standalone company and spinning
off or selling certain of our business lines, which alternatives the Board evaluated with the assistance of its outside
legal and financial advisors and determined did not present the best reasonably available alternative for our
stockholders in light of, among other factors, the potential risks, rewards and uncertainties associated with those
alternatives;

• the Board's belief that its negotiations had resulted in the highest price per share for the Company common stock that
Parent was willing to pay; and 

• the Board's belief that the process conducted by the Company had resulted in the highest price reasonably available to
the stockholders of the Company. 

• Attractive Value.  The Board concluded that the consideration of $10.25 per share represented an attractive valuation for the
Company and an opportunity for the Company's stockholders to receive a significant premium over the market price of the
Company common stock. The Board reviewed the historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to
the Company common stock, and the active sale process undertaken by the Company, including: 

• the fact that the $10.25 per share price to be paid in cash in respect of each share of Company common stock
represents an approximately 18% premium to the closing price per share of the Company's common stock on April 3,
2017, the last full trading day before widespread media speculation about a potential acquisition of the Company, and
an approximately 20% premium to the volume weighted average price per share of the Company's common stock for
the 10-day period ended April 3, 2017; 

• the fact that Barclays and Morgan Stanley, at the Board's instruction, contacted five prospective financial buyers, and
were contacted by two additional prospective financial buyers, regarding a potential acquisition, that of these
prospective buyers, only four parties (including Sycamore) conducted preliminary due diligence, and that no other
party was willing to continue pursuing an acquisition of the Company after conducting preliminary due diligence; 

• the fact that the Company had preliminary discussions with Party A, a potential strategic buyer, regarding the sale of
our U.S. retail business, and that such discussions had led to a preliminary non-binding indication of interest for the
acquisition of such business that was subject to numerous conditions and uncertainties, including the completion of
due diligence, which the Board evaluated with the assistance of outside legal and financial advisors and determined
was less favorable to our stockholders than the merger in light of, among other factors, (i) the greater certainty of
consummation and value the merger would provide to our stockholders, particularly in light of the preliminary nature
of the discussions and the financial, operational and regulatory risks associated with a sale of our U.S. retail business to
Party A, (ii) the competitive and other effects of a sale of our U.S. retail business to Party A on our remaining business,
(iii) the numerous complexities and challenges presented by a separation of our retail and contract delivery businesses,
(iv) the one-time and ongoing incremental costs that would have likely resulted from a separation of our retail and
contract delivery businesses and the adverse impact thereof on the resulting value to our stockholders, and (v) the risks
and uncertainties of continuing to operate the Company's remaining business as a stand-alone company, including
those arising from challenging market conditions and trends, the secular decline in office products sales, the channel
shift from retail to online sales and increased competition; 

• the fact that the Company had not received any other substantive alternative acquisition proposals, despite widespread
speculation in press and analyst reports since early April 2017, including The Wall Street Journal article published on
April 4, 2017, that the Company was considering a sale; 

• the fact that the Company actively solicited increases in the offer made by Parent and Parent indicated that the merger
consideration was its best and final offer; 

• the fact that there were restrictions on the ability of Sycamore and the Company's management to enter into any
discussions or arrangements regarding the terms of

Company's management employment following the closing, including equity incentives, without the Board's consent,
that the Committee notified management of such restrictions in writing and that such discussions have not taken place
as of the date of this proxy statement; and

• the risk that prolonging the sale process further could have resulted in the loss of an opportunity to consummate a
transaction with Parent and distracted senior management from implementing the Company's business plan. 

• Greater Certainty of Value.  The proposed consideration consists solely of cash, which provides immediate liquidity and
certainty of value to our stockholders. The receipt of cash consideration also eliminates for our stockholders the risk of the
continued execution of our business on a stand-alone basis. 

• Business Reputation of Sycamore.  The Board considered the business reputation, management and financial resources of
Sycamore, with respect to the transaction. The Board believed these factors supported the conclusion that a transaction with
affiliates of Sycamore could be completed relatively quickly and in an orderly manner. 

• Relationships with Financial Advisors.  The determination of the Board that the relationships between each of Barclays and
Morgan Stanley, on the one hand, and each of the Company and Sycamore, on the other hand, would not impair the ability of
either Barclays or Morgan Stanley to provide impartial advice to the Board and the fact that Barclays and Morgan Stanley each
agreed at the outset of its engagement with the Company that it would not finance an acquisition of the Company without the
Company's consent. 

• Likelihood of Completion.  The likelihood that the merger will be consummated, particularly in view of the terms of the
merger agreement and the closing conditions. In that regard, the Board noted: 

• the fact that Parent and Merger Sub had obtained committed debt and equity financing for the transaction, the limited
number and nature of the conditions to the debt and equity financing, the reputation of the financing sources and the
obligation of Parent to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the debt financing, each of which, in the reasonable
judgment of the Board, increases the likelihood of such financings being completed; 

• that the merger is not subject to any financing-related condition; 

• the limited number of conditions to the merger and the fact that certain of the Company's obligations in the merger
agreement, including its obligations to cooperate with the carveout transactions and the repatriation of foreign cash,
will not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the closing condition regarding the Company's
compliance with its covenants has been satisfied; 

• the fact that the merger agreement provides that, in the event of a failure of the merger to be consummated under
certain circumstances, Parent will pay the Company a $343,000,000 reverse termination fee, without the Company
having to establish any damages, and the guarantee of such payment obligation pursuant to the limited guarantee; 

• the Company's ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the merger agreement and the equity commitment
letters, to seek specific performance of Parent's obligation to cause the equity commitment to be funded; and 

• the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals and Parent's obligation to effect remedies to obtain
antitrust approvals.

Morgan Stanley, as well as: 

• the opinion of Barclays, dated June 28, 2017, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the
qualifications, factors, limitations and assumptions set forth therein, from a financial point of view, the $10.25 per

Company's Financial Advisors" beginning on page 56 and the full text of such opinion is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex C. 

• Terms of Merger Agreement.  The terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the Company's ability to consider
and respond to, under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, an unsolicited written acquisition proposal (as
more fully described under the heading "The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Other Offers"), and the
Board's right, after complying with the terms of the merger agreement, to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into
an agreement with respect to a superior proposal (as more fully described under the heading "The Merger Agreement—
Restrictions on Changes of Recommendation to Company Stockholders"), subject to certain match rights in favor of Parent and
upon payment of a termination fee to Parent of $171,000,000, which is approximately 2.5% of the equity value of the
Company, as described under "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees" beginning on page 127. 

• Required Stockholder Approval.  The merger agreement is subject to adoption by the Company's stockholders, who are free to
reject the merger agreement. 

• Appraisal Rights.  The Board considered the fact that stockholders who properly exercise and perfect their appraisal rights
under Delaware law will be entitled to such appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

        The Board also weighed the factors described above against the following factors and risks that generally weighed against entering into
the merger agreement (which factors and risks are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):

• No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings.  The Company will no longer exist as an independent company,
and accordingly, Company stockholders will no longer participate in any future growth the Company may have or any
potential future increase in its value. 

• Effect of Failure to Complete Transactions.  While the Company expects that the merger will be consummated, there can be no
assurance that all conditions to the parties' obligations to complete the merger will be satisfied, and thus it is possible that the
merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all. If the merger is not completed, (i) the Company will have incurred
significant risk and transaction and opportunity costs, including the possibility of disruption to our operations, diversion of
management and employee attention, employee attrition and a potentially negative effect on our business and customer and
supplier relationships, (ii) the trading price of shares of Company common stock would likely be adversely affected and
(iii) the market's perceptions of the Company's prospects could be adversely affected.

Table of Contents

• Closing Conditions.  The fact that completion of the merger would require antitrust clearance in the United States and the
satisfaction of certain other closing conditions, including that no Company material adverse effect has occurred, which
conditions are not entirely within the Company's control and that there can be no assurances that any or all such conditions
will be satisfied. 

• Risk Associated with Financing.  The risk that the merger might not be consummated in a timely manner or at all, including
the risk that the merger will not occur if the financing contemplated by the equity and debt commitments, described under the
caption "The Merger—Financing of the Merger," is not obtained, as Parent does not on its own possess sufficient funds to
consummate the merger. 

• Interim Restrictions on Business.  The Company's management's focus and resources may become diverted from other
important business opportunities and operational matters while working to implement the merger, and the merger agreement
imposes restrictions on the conduct of the Company's business prior to the effective time of the merger, which could adversely
affect the Company's business. 

• Risk of Litigation.  There is a risk of litigation arising in respect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement. 

• Taxable Consideration.  The merger will be a taxable transaction to the Company's stockholders that are U.S. holders (as
defined under the heading "—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" below) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and, therefore, such stockholders generally will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on any gains they
recognize as a result of the merger. 

• No Solicitation.  The terms of the merger agreement prohibit the Company and its representatives from soliciting third party
bids and Parent has the right to match an unsolicited third party bid if made, which terms could reduce the likelihood that other
potential acquirers would propose an alternative transaction that may be more advantageous to our stockholders. 

• Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement.  The possibility that if the merger is not consummated, subject to certain
limited exceptions, we will be required to pay our own expenses associated with the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and, under certain circumstances, to pay Parent a termination fee of $171,000,000 or expense
reimbursement of up to $15,000,000 in connection with the termination of the merger agreement. 

• Parent and Merger Sub.  The fact that Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed corporations with no assets other than the
equity commitment letters and the debt commitment letter, and that our remedy in the event of breach of the merger agreement
by Parent or Merger Sub may be limited to receipt of the reverse termination fee from the funds, on a several basis, in an
aggregate amount of $343,000,000, and that, under certain circumstances, we may not be entitled to a reverse termination fee
at all. 

• Suspension of Dividend.  The fact that the Company was restricted from paying its $0.12 per share quarterly cash dividend
following the dividend paid on July 13, 2017, until the closing of the merger.

        In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that
our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours. The Board was aware of
and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the merger, and in their
recommendations with respect to the merger agreement. See the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger"
beginning on page 79.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board in reaching its conclusions and recommendations is not
intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the directors. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in
connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not attempt,
to quantify, rank or assign any relative or specific weights to the various factors considered in reaching its determination and making its
recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board considered all of the
foregoing factors as a whole and based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented.

        The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, "FOR" approval of the
nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation and "FOR" approval of the proposal to approve one or
more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the
time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Opinions of the Company's Financial Advisors 

Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc. 

        The Company engaged Barclays to act as its financial advisor with respect to pursuing strategic alternatives for the Company, including a
possible merger, sale or other strategic business combination of the Company (including the merger) and other extraordinary transactions that
could be entered into as an alternative to such events. On June 28, 2017, Barclays rendered its oral opinion, which opinion was subsequently
confirmed in a written opinion, dated June 28, 2017, to the Board, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limits upon the review undertaken by Barclays as stated in
its written opinion, the merger consideration of $10.25 per share of the Company common stock to be offered to the stockholders of the
Company (other than holders of excluded shares) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.

        The full text of Barclays' written opinion, dated as of June 28, 2017, is attached as Annex Bto this proxy statement. Barclays'
written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and qualifications and
limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering its opinion. The Company encourages you to read the opinion
carefully in its entirety. The following is a summary of Barclays' opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of the opinion.

        Barclays' opinion, the issuance of which was approved by Barclays' Valuation and Fairness Opinion Committee, is addressed to the
Board, addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration of $10.25 per share of the Company common
stock to be offered to the stockholders of the Company (other than holders of excluded shares), and does not constitute a recommendation to
any stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter. The terms of the
merger were determined through arm's-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and were approved by the Board. Barclays did
not recommend any specific amount or form of consideration to the Company or that any specific amount or form of consideration constituted
the only appropriate consideration for the merger. Barclays was not requested to opine as to, and its opinion does not in any manner address,
the Company's underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the merger or the likelihood of the consummation of the merger.
Barclays' opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which the
Company might engage. In addition, Barclays expressed no opinion on, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the
amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the merger, or any class of such persons,
relative to the merger consideration of $10.25 per

share of the Company's common stock to be offered to the stockholders of the Company in the merger. No limitations were imposed by the
Board upon Barclays with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.

        In arriving at its opinion, Barclays, among other things:

• reviewed and analyzed a draft of the merger agreement, dated as of June 28, 2017, and the specific terms of the merger; 

• reviewed and analyzed publicly available information concerning the Company that Barclays believed to be relevant to its
analysis, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2017 and Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 29, 2017; 

• reviewed and analyzed financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of the
Company furnished to Barclays by the Company, including financial forecasts (the "Forecasts") of the Company prepared by
management of the Company; 

• reviewed and analyzed a trading history of the common stock of the Company from June 27, 2014 to June 27 2017 and a
comparison of that trading history with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant; 

• reviewed and analyzed a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition of the Company with
those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant; 

• reviewed and analyzed a comparison of the financial terms of the merger with the financial terms of certain other transactions
that Barclays deemed relevant; 

• reviewed and analyzed the results of Barclays' efforts to solicit indications of interest from third parties with respect to a sale
of the Company; 

• reviewed and analyzed published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the future financial performance
and price targets of the Company; 

• had discussions with the management of the Company concerning its business, operations, assets, liabilities, financial
condition and prospects; and 

• undertook such other studies, analyses and investigations as Barclays deemed appropriate.

        In arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used
by Barclays without any independent verification of such information (and did not assume responsibility or liability for any independent
verification of such information). Barclays also relied upon the assurances of management of the Company that they were not aware of any
facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Forecasts of the
Company, upon the advice of the Company, Barclays assumed that such Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company and
that the Company will perform substantially in accordance with such Forecasts. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed no responsibility
for and expressed no view as to any such forecasts or estimates or the assumptions on which they were based. In arriving at its opinion,
Barclays did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of the Company and did not make or obtain any evaluations or
appraisals of the assets or liabilities of the Company. Barclays' opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as
they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its opinion. Barclays assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion
based on events or circumstances that may have occurred after June 28, 2017.

        Barclays assumed that the executed merger agreement would conform in all material respects to the last draft reviewed by Barclays. In
addition, Barclays assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and all agreements related
thereto. Barclays also

assumed, upon the advice of the Company, that all material governmental, regulatory and third party approvals, consents and releases for the
merger would be obtained within the constraints contemplated by the merger agreement and that the merger would be consummated in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement
thereof. Barclays understood that Parent received draft equity commitment letters from funds managed by Sycamore and Neuberger Berman
Private Equity and investment funds affiliated with HarbourVest Partners (the funds managed by Neuberger Berman Private Equity and
affiliated with HarbourVest Partners collectively referred to as, the "Co-Investors"), each dated June 28, 2017, as applicable, and draft debt
commitment letters from certain lenders dated June 28, 2017 (collectively the "financing letters"). Barclays expressed no opinion with respect
to the terms of the equity or debt commitment letters or the availability of the financing contemplated thereby. Barclays did not express any
opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the merger, nor does its opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or
accounting matters, as to which Barclays understood that the Company had obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified
professionals.

Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC 

        The Company retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services in connection with a possible merger, sale or other
strategic business combination of the Company or a similar transaction. As part of such engagement, the Board requested that Morgan Stanley
evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the shares of the Company's common stock of the $10.25 per share
merger consideration to be received pursuant to the merger agreement. Morgan Stanley rendered to the Board at its meeting on June 28, 2017
Morgan Stanley's oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated June 28, 2017, that, as of such date, and based
upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written opinion, the $10.25 per share merger consideration to be received by the holders of
shares of the Company common stock (other than holders of excluded shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders. Morgan Stanley's opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative
business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available.

        The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Board, dated June 28, 2017, is attached as Annex C.The
opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. The Company's stockholders are urged
to, and should, read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley's opinion is directed to the Board and addresses only the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Company's stockholders of the $10.25 per share merger consideration to be received by
such holders pursuant to the merger agreement as of the date of the opinion. Morgan Stanley's opinion does not address any other
aspect of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and does not constitute a recommendation to the Company's
stockholders as to how to vote at the special meeting held in connection with the merger. The summary of Morgan Stanley's opinion
set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Morgan Stanley's opinion.

        For purposes of rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:

• reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company; 

• reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company; 

• reviewed the Forecasts prepared by the management of the Company;

the Company;

• compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the shares of common stock of the
Company with that of certain other publicly traded companies comparable with the Company and their securities;

• reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated as of June 28, 2017, the financing letters and certain related documents; and 

• performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed
appropriate.

        In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of
the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to it by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for
its opinion. With respect to the Forecasts, Morgan Stanley assumed that such Forecasts had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company at the time prepared of the future financial performance
of the Company. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the
merger agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that Parent would
obtain financing in accordance with the terms indicated in the financing letters and expressed no opinion with respect to the terms of the
financing letters or the availability of the financing contemplated thereby, and that the final merger agreement did not differ in any material
respects from the last draft of the merger agreement which was reviewed by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that, in connection
with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the merger, no delays, limitations,
conditions or restrictions would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in
the merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without
independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory
matters. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the
Company's officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration to be received by the
Company's stockholders in the transaction. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of
the Company, nor was it furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley's opinion was necessarily based on financial,
economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it, as of June 28, 2017. Events occurring after
such date may affect Morgan Stanley's opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Morgan Stanley's opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and
other professionals in accordance with its customary practice. Morgan Stanley did not recommend any specific amount or form of
consideration to the Company or that any specific amount or form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the
merger. No limitations were imposed by the Board upon Morgan Stanley with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it
in rendering its opinion.

Summary of Financial Analyses 

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared by Morgan Stanley and Barclays (referred to as the "financial
advisors") in connection with the rendering of the financial advisors' respective oral opinions, subsequently confirmed by delivery of
respective written opinions, dated June 28, 2017, to the Board and reviewed with the Board on June 28, 2017. The preparation of a financial
opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis
and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary
description. The financial advisors arrived at their respective opinions based on the results of all analyses undertaken and assessed as a whole,
and they did not ascribe a specific range of values to the shares of the Company common stock or draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with
regard to, and did not attribute any particular weight to, any one factor or method of analysis, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the
significance and relevance of each analysis and factor relative to all other analyses and factors performed and considered by them and in the
context of the circumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, the summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete
description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying the opinions of, the financial advisors, nor does the
order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those financial analyses by either of the financial
advisors. The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses and
of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying
the financial advisors' respective opinions. In addition, in rendering their opinions, the financial advisors may have given various analyses and
factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions. As a result, the ranges of implied valuations resulting from any particular analysis described below should not be taken to be
Morgan Stanley's or Barclays's view of the actual value of the Company.

        In performing their financial analyses, summarized below, the financial advisors considered industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters existing as of the date of their respective opinions, many of which are beyond
Morgan Stanley's, Barclays' and the Company's control. The assumptions and estimates contained in the financial analyses and the ranges of
implied valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such analyses. In addition, financial analyses relating to the value of businesses
or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the
assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

        The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined by Parent and the Company, rather than by any financial
advisor, and was approved by the Board. The decision by the Company to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Board. As
described above under "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board," the financial advisors' analyses were only one
of the many factors considered by the Board in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the
Board or management with respect to the merger or the $10.25 per share merger consideration.

        Certain financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the
financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary as the tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses. Please see Annex Band Annex Cof this proxy statement for the full text of the opinions of
Barclays and Morgan Stanley, respectively.

Selected Comparable Trading Analysis

        The financial advisors reviewed certain financial information, valuation multiples and market trading data relating to the Company and
selected publicly traded companies that each Company financial advisor believed, based on its experience with companies in the retail and
distribution industries, to be similar to Company's current operations for purposes of this analysis. Financial data of the selected companies
were reflected in FactSet Research Systems, Inc. consensus estimates, public filings and other publicly available information. Financial data
of the Company was reflected in the Forecasts and share data was provided to the financial advisors by the Company management. "EV"
refers to aggregate enterprise value, calculated as equity value, plus book value of total debt, plus non-controlling interest (as appropriate for
the company being analyzed), less cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. "EBITDA" refers to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization as adjusted to exclude nonrecurring and other similar items and one-time charges. Certain of the foregoing
terms are used throughout this summary of financial analyses.

        The financial advisors reviewed data, including EV as a multiple of estimated 2017 EBITDA (referred to as EV/2017E EBITDA), of the
Company and each of the following selected publicly traded companies in the retail and distribution industries, the operations of which the
financial advisors deemed similar for purposes of this analysis, based on their professional judgment and experience, to the Company:

• Retail Industry 

• Best Buy Co., Inc. 

• Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. 

• Bed, Bath and Beyond Inc. 

• Office Depot, Inc. 

• GameStop Corp. 

• Barnes & Noble, Inc. 

• Distribution Industry 

• Pool Corp 

• Cintas Corporation 

• MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc. 

• Genuine Parts Company 

• HD Supply Holdings, Inc.

Table of Contents

        With respect to the selected comparable companies, the information the financial advisors presented to the Board included EV / 2017E
EBITDA multiples:

Comparable Companies in the Retail Industry

Comparable Companies in the Distribution Industry

        Based on this analysis and their professional judgment and experience, the financial advisors derived a reference range of EV / 2017E
EBITDA multiples of 4.5x to 6.5x and applied these multiples to estimated EBITDA for 2017 as reflected in the Forecasts.

        Based on the number of outstanding shares of the Company common stock on a fully-diluted basis as provided by the Company
management and the Company's net debt, non-controlling interest as of April 29, 2017 as disclosed in the Company's public filings, the
analysis indicated the implied equity value per share range for the Company common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.05, of $7.85 – $11.15
as compared to the $10.25 per share merger consideration.

        No company utilized in the selected comparable trading analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating selected companies, the
financial advisors made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the Company's and the financial advisors' control. These include, among other
things, selected company growth, profitability and customer concentration, the impact of competition on the Company's businesses and the
industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the Company's financial condition and prospects or the
industry, or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the average or median) is not in itself a
meaningful method of using selected company data.

Precedent Transactions Analysis

        The financial advisors performed a precedent transactions analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company based on publicly
available financial terms of selected transactions that involve companies in the retail and distribution sectors. Selected comparable
transactions were selected based

on the financial advisors' professional judgment and knowledge of the retail and distribution industries, the operations of which the financial
advisors deemed similar for purposes of this analysis, based on their professional judgment and experience.

        For each transaction listed below, the financial advisors divided EV by the target company's EBITDA for the 12-month period prior to
the announcement of the transaction (referred to as "LTM EBITDA").

Selected Precedent Transactions in the Retail Sectors

Selected Precedent Transactions in the Distribution Sectors

        Based on this analysis and their professional judgment, the financial advisors derived a reference range of EV/LTM EBITDA multiple of
5.0x to 7.0x and applied this range to the Company's projected estimated LTM EBITDA for 2017 as reflected in the Forecasts.

        Based on the number of outstanding Company shares on a fully diluted basis provided by the Company management and the Company's
net debt, and non-controlling interest as of April 29, 2017 as disclosed in the Company's public filings, the analysis indicated the implied per
share reference range for the Company common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.05, of $8.65 – $12.00.

        No company or transaction utilized as a comparison in the selected precedent transactions analysis is identical to the Company, nor are
the transactions identical to the merger. In evaluating the transactions described above, the financial advisors made judgments and
assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of the Company, such as the impact of competition on the business of the Company or the industry generally,
industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition or property of the Company or the industry or in the
financial markets in general. Accordingly, mathematical analysis, such as determining the average or median, is not in itself a meaningful
method of using comparable transaction data.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Each of the financial advisors conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied equity value per
share for the Company common stock. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using estimates of the future cash
flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the time value of money with respect to those future cash flows by calculating their
present value. For purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis, the financial advisors used "unlevered free cash flows," which refers to a
calculation of the future cash flows of an asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. For purposes of the foregoing
calculation, stock-based compensation is treated as a cash expense. "Present value" refers to the current value of one or more future cash
payments from an asset, which current value is referred to as that asset's cash flows, and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to
the present using a discount rate that takes into account estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital and other appropriate factors.
"Terminal value" refers to the capitalized value of all cash flows from an asset for periods beyond the final forecast period.

        Each of the financial advisors performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company using information provided by the Company,
including information contained in the Forecasts and public filings, to calculate ranges of the implied value of the Company as of the end of
fiscal year 2016. Unlevered free cash flows was defined as earnings before interest and taxes, less taxes, plus depreciation and amortization,
less capital expenditures, less increases in net working capital, less other cash flow items and acquisitions (in each case reflected in the
Forecasts provided by the Company management to the financial advisors).

        Barclays calculated a range of implied values per share of the Company common stock using the estimated future unlevered free cash
flows reflected in the Forecasts for the fiscal years 2017 through 2021 and a terminal value for the Company as of the end of fiscal year 2021,
derived by applying a range of EV / LTM multiples of 4.5x to 6.5x, selected based on Barclays' professional judgment and experience, to the
terminal year estimate of LTM EBITDA, as reflected in the Forecasts. To calculate an implied enterprise value for the Company, the
unlevered free cash flows and the terminal value were discounted to the end of fiscal year 2016 using a range of discount rates from 8.91%
and 10.21%, which range of discount rates was calculated based on Barclays' professional judgment and experience and an analysis of the
weighted average cost of capital of the Company. Barclays then adjusted the total implied enterprise value ranges by the Company's total
debt, non-controlling interest and cash and cash equivalents based on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of April 29, 2017 and
divided the resulting implied total equity value ranges by the Company's fully diluted shares outstanding (calculated using the treasury stock
method), all as provided by the Company management. This analysis indicated an implied per share reference range for the Company
common stock of $9.38 – $12.40.

        Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied values per share of the Company common stock using the estimated future unlevered free
cash flows reflected in the Forecasts for the fiscal years 2017 through 2021 and a terminal value for the Company as of the end of fiscal year
2021, derived by applying a range of EV / LTM multiples of 4.5x to 6.5x, selected based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment, to the
terminal year estimate of LTM EBITDA, as reflected in the Forecasts. To calculate an implied enterprise value for the Company, the
unlevered free cash flows and the terminal value were discounted to end of fiscal year 2016 using a range of discount rates from 8.1% to
9.8%, which range of discount rates was calculated based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment and experience and an analysis of the
weighted average cost of capital of the Company. Morgan Stanley then adjusted the total implied enterprise value ranges by the Company's
total debt, non-controlling interest and cash and cash equivalents based on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of April 29,
2017 and divided the resulting implied total equity value ranges by the fully diluted shares of the Company common stock outstanding
(calculated using the treasury stock method), all as provided by the Company management. This analysis indicated an implied per share
reference range for the Company common stock of $9.52 – $12.79.

        The financial advisors also calculated a range of implied values per share of the Company common stock using the data and
methodologies described above, except that that the unlevered free cash flows and terminal values were discounted to the end of fiscal year
2016 using a range of discount rates from 8.5% to 10.5%, which represented an amalgamation of the weighted average cost of capital
methodologies of the financial advisors. This analysis, which indicated an implied per share reference range for the Company common stock
of $9.30 – $12.60 was provided to the Board for informational/reference purposes only and did not provide the basis for the rendering of the
financial advisors' opinions.

Illustrative Leveraged Buyout Analysis

        The financial advisors performed a hypothetical leveraged buyout analysis to determine the prices at which a financial sponsor might
effect a leveraged buyout of the Company. In preparing this analysis, the financial advisors utilized the projections set forth in the Forecasts.
The financial advisors assumed (1) a transaction date of January 28, 2017 based on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of
April 29, 2017, (2) a subsequent exit transaction by the financial sponsor at the end of fiscal year 2021, (3) a multiple of 4.00x of total debt to
the Company's estimated 2017 adjusted EBITDA, as set forth in the Forecast and as adjusted with the consent of the Company to exclude the
cost of stock-based compensation, (4) a range from 4.5x to 6.5x of EV to 2021 EBITDA exit multiples and (5) target ranges of annualized
internal rates of return for the financial sponsor of 20.0% to 25.0%. The financial advisors selected the leverage multiple, financing terms, exit
multiples and target internal rates of return based upon the application of their professional judgment and experience. This analysis indicated
an implied per share reference range for the Company common stock, rounded to the nearest $0.05, of $8.20 – $10.35.

Other Analyses

        The analyses and data described below were presented to the Board for informational/reference purposes only and did not provide the
basis for, and were not otherwise material to, the rendering of the financial advisors' opinions.

Historical Trading Range Analysis

        The financial advisors reviewed the historical trading range of shares of the Company common stock for the 52-week period ended
June 27, 2017. The financial advisors noted that, during such period, the maximum closing price for the shares of the Company common
stock was $10.01 and the minimum closing price for the shares of Company common stock was $7.28.

Table of Contents

        The financial advisors also reviewed the historical affected trading range of shares of the Company common stock for the period between
April 4, 2017, which was the last trading day prior to public speculation of a potential sale of the Company, and June 27, 2017. The financial
advisors noted that, during such period, the maximum closing price for shares of the Company common stock was $9.88 and the minimum
closing price for shares of the Company common stock shares was $8.66.

        The historical trading ranges were presented for reference purposes only, and were not relied upon for valuation purposes.

Analyst Price Targets

        The financial advisors reviewed publicly available equity research analysts per share price targets for shares of the Company common
stock. The research analysts' one year per share price targets for the Company common stock ranged from approximately $8.00 to $12.00.
The financial advisors also calculated the implied present value of the low and high one year per share price targets by applying a discount
rate of 11.00%, representing an estimated cost of equity of the Company, to the $8.00 to $10.00 range of one year per share price targets
(which excluded the analyst price targets derived using a sum of the parts methodology, the average of which, after applying a discount rate of
11.00%, would have yielded an illustrative implied equity value per share of the Company common stock of $10.35), which yielded a range
of illustrative implied equity values per share of the Company common stock of $7.20 – $9.00 per share of the Company common stock.
Morgan Stanley also calculated the implied present value of the low and high one year per share price targets by applying a discount rate of
10.1%, representing a midpoint estimated cost of equity of the Company, to the $8.00 – $10.00 range of one year per share price targets
(which excluded the analyst price targets derived using a sum of the parts methodology, the average of which, after applying a discount rate of
10.1%, would have yielded an illustrative implied equity value per share of the Company common stock of $10.45), which yielded a range of
illustrative implied equity values per share of the Company common stock of $7.27 – $9.08.

        The analysts' price targets were presented for reference purposes only, and were not relied upon for valuation purposes.

Company Financial Forecasts; Other Company Information 

        The Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose financial forecasts as to future financial performance, earnings or other
results for extended periods due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting future periods and the likelihood that
the underlying assumptions and estimates may prove incorrect. While the Company prepares forecasts annually for internal budgeting and
business planning purposes, such forecasts generally focus on the current fiscal year and the immediately following fiscal year.

        However, in connection with the evaluation of a possible transaction, we provided projections to our directors and their advisors as well
as to prospective financial bidders, including Parent, Party B, Party C, Party D and Party E, in connection with their due diligence review of
the Company. These projections contained certain non-public financial forecasts that were prepared by our management.

        A summary of the financial forecasts included in the projections has been included below. This summary is not being included in this
document to influence your decision whether to vote for or against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but is being included because
these financial forecasts were made available to our directors and their advisors as well as to prospective financial bidders. The inclusion of
this information should not be regarded as an indication that our directors or their advisors, or any other person, considered, or now considers,
such financial forecasts to be material or to be necessarily predictive of actual future results, and these forecasts should not be relied upon as
such. Our management's internal financial forecasts, upon which the summary financial forecasts included below were based, are subjective
in many respects. There can be no assurance that these financial forecasts will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher
or lower than forecasted.

        In addition, the financial forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward complying with generally accepted
accounting principles, which we refer to as GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the use of non-GAAP
financial measures or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
prospective financial information. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have
audited, compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the financial forecasts contained herein, nor have they expressed
any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.

        These financial forecasts were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond our
control. We believe the assumptions that our management used as a basis for this projected financial information were reasonable, and that the
bases on which the financial forecasts were prepared reflected the best currently available estimates and judgments of management of the
future financial performance of the Company, at the time our management prepared these financial forecasts, given the information our
management had at the time. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause these financial forecasts not to be achieved include, but
are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to our business (including our ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over
the applicable periods), industry performance, general business and economic conditions, the regulatory environment and other factors
described in or referenced under "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information" beginning on page 28 and "The Merger—
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board" beginning on page 51 and those risks and uncertainties detailed in the Company's
public periodic filings with the SEC. In addition, the forecasts also reflect assumptions that are subject to change and do not reflect revised
prospects for our business, changes in general business or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may
occur and that was not anticipated at the time the financial forecasts were prepared. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that these
financial forecasts will be realized or that our future financial results will not materially vary from these financial forecasts.

        No one has made or makes any representation to any stockholder regarding the information included in the financial forecasts set forth
below. We have made no representation to Parent or Merger Sub in the merger agreement concerning these financial forecasts.

        We have not updated and do not intend to update or otherwise revise the financial forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the
date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions on which such forecasts were
based are shown to be in error. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in these projections, stockholders are cautioned
not to place undue, if any, reliance on these projections.

        In preparing the financial forecasts our management made the following material assumptions:

• Delivery growth acceleration based on over $1 billion in mid-market sales growth between fiscal years 2016 and fiscal year
2020, driven by investments in sales force, pricing, memberships and continued growth in Pro Categories; 

• "Tuck-in" acquisitions increasing North American Delivery sales by approximately $400 million by fiscal year 2020; and 

• Implementation of approximately $425 million of net cost savings by fiscal year 2020, including reduction of direct vendor
costs, own brand savings, discounting optimization, supply chain savings and other operating efficiencies.

        The estimates of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, unlevered free cash flow and unlevered cash flow constitute non-GAAP financial
measures within the meaning of applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in
isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by
the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies. The tables below include reconciliations of
EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, unlevered free cash flow and unlevered cash flow to the Company's EBIT forecasts.

(1) The Company provided financial forecasts to prospective financial bidders that differ from those shown in the table
above in the manner described below. On March 13, 2017, after providing such financial forecasts to prospective
financial bidders, the Company announced an agreement to sell its operations in Australia and New Zealand, which sale
was subsequently completed on April 28, 2017. The amounts set forth in the table above, other than the unlevered cash
flow amounts, were updated and provided to our directors and their advisors after the announced sale of the Australia
and New Zealand operations to reflect the removal of amounts forecasted for the divested operations, but are otherwise
consistent with the financial forecasts provided to prospective financial bidders (except as described in note 5 below). 

(2) The financial forecasts provided to prospective financial bidders did not include any forecasts for fiscal years 2021
through 2023. None of the financial forecasts, whether provided to prospective financial bidders or otherwise, included
unlevered cash flow amounts beyond 2020 or EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow amounts for 2022 and 2023. The
financial projections for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 were extrapolations prepared by management for Barclays' and
Morgan Stanley's use in connection with their financial analyses, and were prepared assuming segment revenue growth
and EBITDA margins for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 consistent with those projected for fiscal year 2020. 

(3) The revenue forecasts provided to prospective financial bidders reflected the following values (in millions), which
include the Company's operations in Australia and New Zealand: (i) $18,061 for fiscal year 2016 (reflecting 10 months
of actual results and forecasted amounts for the remaining 2 months), (ii) $17,952 for fiscal year 2017, (iii) $18,489 for
fiscal year 2018, (iv) $18,759 for fiscal year 2019 and (v) $18,990 for fiscal year 2020. The amounts set forth in the
table above have been adjusted solely to reflect the removal of the divested operations in Australia and New Zealand. 

(4) The financial forecasts provided to prospective financial bidders did not include forecasts of adjusted EBITDA. The
adjusted EBITDA forecasts were prepared solely for purposes of the leveraged buyout analysis performed by Barclays
and Morgan Stanley, described under "The Merger—Opinions of the Company's Financial Advisors—Summary of
Financial Analyses" beginning on page 60, and do not reflect management's expectations regarding the actual results of
operations of the Company under its stand-alone strategic plan. See "The Merger—Company Financial Forecasts;
Other Company Information—Non-GAAP Reconciliation" beginning on page 71 for a description of the calculation of
adjusted EBITDA. 

(5) The EBITDA forecasts provided to prospective financial bidders reflected the following values (in millions), which
include the Company's operations in Australia and New Zealand: (i) $1,281 for fiscal year 2016 (reflecting 10 months
of actual results and forecasted amounts for the remaining 2 months), (ii) $1,131 for fiscal year 2017, (iii) $1,217 for
fiscal year 2018, (iv) $1,296 for fiscal year

Non-GAAP Reconciliation

        The following are summaries of the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures included in the financial forecasts to forecasted
EBIT. The EBIT forecasts were not prepared with a view toward complying with GAAP, and the Company did not project, and the amounts
in the tables below do not reflect, certain non-recurring expenses, such as impairment charges, losses on the sale of property and equipment
and selling, general and administrative expenses related to strategic initiatives, that have historically been reflected in the Company's GAAP
operating income. No other comparable financial measure was forecast with a view toward complying with GAAP, and such forecasts could
not be made available without unreasonable effort.

2019 and (v) $1,330 for fiscal year 2020. The amounts set forth in the table above have been adjusted solely to reflect
the removal of the divested operations in Australia and New Zealand and the correction of a clerical error, which
correction was disclosed to Sycamore and resulted in an increase to EBITDA of approximately $8 million per year. See
"The Merger—Company Financial Forecasts; Other Company Information—Non-GAAP Reconciliation" beginning on
page 71 for a description of the calculation of EBITDA.

(6) The unlevered free cash flow forecasts set forth in the table above were not provided to prospective financial bidders
and reflect the removal of the divested operations in Australia and New Zealand. See "The Merger—Company Financial
Forecasts; Other Company Information—Non-GAAP Reconciliation" beginning on page 71 for a description of the
calculation of unlevered free cash flow. 

(7) The unlevered cash flow forecasts set forth in the table above were provided to prospective financial bidders, but were
not used in the financial analyses performed by Barclays and Morgan Stanley. The unlevered cash flow forecasts in the
table above include the Company's operations in Australia and New Zealand. In addition to the amounts set forth in the
table above, the unlevered cash flow forecasts provided to prospective financial bidders included (in millions) $1,107
for fiscal year 2016 (reflecting 10 months of actual results and forecasted amounts for the remaining 2 months). See
"The Merger—Company Financial Forecasts; Other Company Information—Non-GAAP Reconciliation" beginning on

Other Company Information

        In addition to the financial forecasts summarized above, the Company's management provided our directors, their advisors and
prospective financial bidders illustrative estimates of the potential upside opportunities of certain growth and profitability initiatives. These
estimates reflected potential growth and profitability opportunities rather than management's or the Board's expectations regarding the
performance of the business, were determined not to be indicative of the performance of the Company under its stand-alone strategic plan,
and were deemed too speculative by the Board and management for inclusion in the Company's financial forecasts or a basis for the fairness
opinions delivered by Barclays and Morgan Stanley. These illustrative estimates do not account for the expenses that would be incurred by the
Company to implement these initiatives. The following are the illustrative estimates provided by the Company's management:
(i) $715 million to $790 million in incremental annual sales

2016 to future years. The Company's GAAP effective tax rate for 2016 was 30.5%. The non-GAAP effective tax rate
was calculated after excluding non-cash adjustments for the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, as well as
certain non-recurring expenses.

provided to prospective financial bidders included (in millions) $1,107 for fiscal year 2016 (reflecting 10 months of

and $85 million to $100 million in incremental annual EBITDA that might result from incremental "tuck-in" acquisitions of businesses
reflecting $750 million in annual sales (in addition to the "tuck-in" acquisitions increasing North American Delivery sales by approximately
$400 million reflected in the financial forecasts); (ii) $390 million to $430 million in incremental annual sales and $55 million to $65 million
in incremental annual EBITDA that might result from an increase in the fiscal year 2019 and 2020 growth rates among middle market
customers from 12% (as reflected in the financial forecasts) to 20% annually; (iii) $380 million to $420 million in incremental annual sales
and $80 to $90 million in incremental annual EBITDA that might result from incremental growth among Corporate & Enterprise customers
and Quill customers as an indirect effect of the middle market growth initiative described above; (iv) $350 million to $500 million in
incremental annual EBITDA that might result from $1.1 billion in gross cost savings if achieved by fiscal year 2020 (as compared to the
$425 million in net cost savings achieved in the same period under the financial forecasts); and (v) $500 million in incremental annual sales
and $75 million in incremental annual EBITDA that might result from potential growth initiatives in the Technology, Copiers & Printing,
Shipping & Packaging Supplies and Powered by Staples business lines. These illustrative estimates also included $65 million in incremental
annual EBITDA that might result from the elimination of stock-based compensation by a prospective purchaser.

        Our directors also reviewed three illustrative ranges of hypothetical values for a hypothetical sale of the Company's U.S. retail business
("USR") or the Company's North American retail business ("NAR") and the Company's continued operation and execution of the remainder
of its business on a standalone basis, based upon, among other assumptions, assumed proceeds from a sale of USR and NAR, one-time and
ongoing incremental costs to the sold and retained businesses resulting from the business separation and estimated 2017 EBITDA for the
retained business, each as preliminarily estimated by Company management. The illustrative range of hypothetical total value to stockholders
of the Company from a hypothetical sale of USR to Company A and continued operation of the remaining business (which would have
included Canada retail and contract delivery) reviewed by our directors was $7.99 to $10.49 per share of Company common stock, and was
based on, among other assumptions, the receipt by the Company of $500 million to $1.0 billion of gross cash proceeds from the sale of USR
to Party A, ongoing annual incremental costs of $153 million to the Company's remaining business, one-time separation costs of $70 million,
no tax leakage and the application of a hypothetical trading multiple for the remaining business of 6.0x to 7.5x to estimated 2017 EBITDA for
the remaining business. The illustrative range of hypothetical total value to the stockholders of the Company from a hypothetical sale of USR
to a financial buyer and continued operation of the remaining business (which would have included Canada retail and contract delivery)
reviewed by our directors was $8.45 to $10.44 per share of Company common stock, and was based on, among other assumptions, the receipt
by the Company of $375 million to $450 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of USR to a financial buyer, ongoing annual incremental
costs of $92.5 million to the remaining business, no one-time separation costs or tax leakage and the application of a hypothetical trading
multiple for the remaining business of 6.0x to 7.5x to estimated 2017 EBITDA for the remaining business. The illustrative range of
hypothetical total value to stockholders of the Company from a hypothetical sale of NAR to a financial buyer and continued operation of the
remaining business (which would have included contract delivery) reviewed by our directors, was $8.71 to $10.41 per share, and was based
on, among other assumptions, the receipt by the Company of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of NAR, ongoing
annual incremental costs of $92.5 million to the remaining business, no one-time separation costs or tax leakage and application of a
hypothetical trading multiple for the remaining business of 7.0x to 8.5x to estimated 2017 EBITDA for the remaining business.

        The hypothetical valuation ranges were based on hypothetical transactions, highly illustrative and preliminary in nature, and, with the
consent of the Board, were not part of the financial analyses performed by Barclays and Morgan Stanley in connection with their fairness
opinions. The hypothetical

valuation ranges also reflect numerous assumptions and estimates provided by Company management that are subject to significant
uncertainty and were prepared solely to illustrate hypothetical values to Company stockholders from the hypothetical separation of the
Company's business. The hypothetical ranges of values do not reflect actual alternative proposals made to the Company and, in the case of a
sale of USR to Party A, reflect a range that significantly exceeds at the high end the preliminary valuations contained in the non-binding
indications of interest Party A submitted to the Company. The execution of the hypothetical transactions also carried significant risks,
including with respect to: (i) the uncertainty as to whether and, if so, at what price, Party A or any other potential acquirors would acquire
USR or NAR; (ii) the ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for a sale of USR in a timely fashion or at all; (iii) the competitive
and other effects of a sale of USR to Party A on our remaining business; (iv) the numerous complexities and challenges presented by a
separation of our retail and contract delivery businesses; (v) the fact that the one-time and ongoing incremental cost estimates from a
separation of our retail and contract delivery businesses could exceed the preliminary management estimates utilized for purposes of
hypothetical valuation ranges; and (v) the risks and uncertainties of continuing to operate the Company's remaining business as a stand-alone
company, including those arising from challenging market conditions and trends, the secular decline in office products sales, the channel shift
from retail to online sales and increased competition.

Financing of the Merger 

        Parent estimates that the total amount of funds required to complete the merger and related transactions, including to pay fees and
expenses in connection with the merger, is approximately $6.9 billion. Parent expects to fund this amount through a combination of:

• cash equity contributions from investment funds managed by Sycamore and Neuberger Berman Private Equity and investment
funds affiliated with HarbourVest Partners of up to $1,920 million, which is described below under "—Financing of the
Merger—Equity Financing;" and 

• debt financing consisting of commitments for (i) a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of
$2,400 million, (ii) an asset based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,200 million, (iii) a senior
unsecured bridge facility or senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1,600 million, (iv) an asset based
revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million and (v) an asset based revolving credit facility in an
aggregate principal amount of $600 million, on terms and conditions set forth in the debt commitment letter. Parent has
received firm commitments from certain financial institutions to provide the debt financing, which is described below under
"—Financing of the Merger—Debt Financing."

        The consummation of the merger is not subject to a financing condition (although the funding of the debt and equity financing is subject
to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the commitment letters under which the financing will be provided).

Equity Financing 

        Parent has entered into letter agreements, dated June 28, 2017 (the "equity commitment letters"), pursuant to which investment funds
managed by Sycamore and Neuberger Berman Private Equity and investment funds affiliated with HarbourVest Partners, which we refer to
collectively as the funds, have agreed to contribute $1,385 million, $270 million and $265 million, respectively, for an aggregate amount
equal to $1,920 million to Parent in exchange for equity securities of Parent (the "equity financing").

        The funds' obligations to fund the equity financing contemplated by the equity commitment letters are generally subject to satisfaction of
the following conditions:

• the marketing period has ended; 

• the satisfaction, or express written waiver by Parent, of all conditions precedent to Parent's obligations to consummate the
merger as set forth in the merger agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing
(but subject to such conditions being satisfied at the closing)); 

• the portion of the equity financing that is to be funded by the other funds pursuant to their respective equity commitment
letters has been funded or will be funded substantially concurrently; 

• the debt financing (including any alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with the merger agreement) has
been or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the closing if (i) the equity financing is or were to be funded by
the applicable fund and (ii) the equity commitments from the other funds are or were to be funded by such other funds; and 

• the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that it stands ready, willing and able to consummate the merger.

        No fund is entitled to assert the condition described in the third bullet above unless another fund has refused in writing to fund its equity
financing or has failed to fund its equity financing when required. In addition, the failure of the condition described in the third bullet above
does not limit or impair Parent's or the Company's ability to enforce the obligations of such fund if and only if Parent (or the Company, as
applicable) is also seeking enforcement of the equity commitment letters of other funds that have refused in writing to fund their portion of
the equity financing (if any) or have failed to fund their equity financing when required (and the contemporaneous funding thereunder) or the
other funds have satisfied or are prepared to satisfy their respective obligations to fund the commitments under their respective equity
commitment letters.

        The funds' obligations to fund the equity financing will terminate upon the earliest to occur of:

• the valid termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, 

• the closing of the merger, if the equity financings have been funded in accordance with the terms of the equity commitments,
or 

• the Company or any of its affiliates asserting a claim against any of the funds or certain of its affiliates in connection with the
equity commitment letter, the limited guarantee, the merger agreement or any transactions contemplated thereby other than
claims permitted under the equity commitment letter, limited guarantee or the merger agreement.

        In no event will a fund have any obligation to fund its equity commitment at any time after such fund has made full payment of its
guaranteed obligations under the terms of the limited guarantee as described below.

        The Company is an express third-party beneficiary of the equity commitment letter and has the right to specific performance to enforce
each fund's obligations under its equity commitment letter solely to the extent the Company has the right to seek specific performance under
the merger agreement to require Parent to cause the equity commitment under the equity commitment letter to be funded. Each fund may
assign its obligation to fund any portion of the equity commitment to one or more of its affiliates, or to one or more other investors governed
by one of its affiliates or affiliated funds, provided that such assignment will not relieve such assigning fund of its obligation to fund the full
amount of its equity commitment.

Debt Financing 

        In connection with the entry into the merger agreement, Parent has obtained commitment letters from (A) UBS AG, Stamford Branch
("UBS"), UBS Securities LLC ("UBSS"), Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"), Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
("Merrill Lynch"), Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch ("DBNY"), Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ("DBSI"), Deutsche Bank AG Cayman
Islands Branch ("DBCI"), Credit Suisse AG (acting through such of its affiliates or branches as it deems appropriate, "CS"), Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC ("CS Securities"), Royal Bank of Canada ("RBC"), RBC Capital Markets ("RBCCM"), Jefferies Finance LLC
("Jefferies Finance"), Fifth Third Bank ("Fifth Third" and, together with UBS, UBSS, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, DBNY, DBSI, DBCI,
CS, CS Securities, RBC, RBCCM, Jefferies Finance, the "Term Lenders" and the "Bridge Lenders"), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
("Wells Fargo") and Wells Fargo Capital Finance Corporation Canada ("WFCFCC" and, together with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and
Wells Fargo, the "ABL Lenders;" the ABL Lenders and the Term/Bridge Lenders being collectively referred to as the "Lenders") (as amended
from time to time in accordance with the merger agreement, the "debt commitment letter") pursuant to which the Lenders commit to provide,
severally but not jointly, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the debt commitment letter, in the aggregate $6,000 million
in debt financing (not all of which is expected to be drawn at the closing of the merger), consisting of (i) a senior secured term loan facility in
an aggregate principal amount of $2,400 million provided by the Term Lenders (the "term loan facility"), (ii) an asset based revolving credit
facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,200 million (not all of which is expected to be drawn at the closing of the merger) provided by
the ABL Lenders (the "NAD ABL facility"), (iii) a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,600 million
provided by the Bridge Lenders (the "bridge facility"), (iv) an asset based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of
$200 million (not all of which is expected to be drawn at the closing of the merger) provided by the ABL Lenders (the "CAR ABL facility")
and (v) an asset based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million (not all of which is expected to be drawn at
the closing of the merger) provided by the ABL Lenders (the "USR ABL facility" and, together with the NAD ABL facility and the CAR
ABL facility, the "ABL facilities"). We refer to the financing described above as the "debt financing."

        The aggregate principal amount of the term loan facility may be increased to fund certain original issue discount or upfront fees in
connection with the debt financing. The proceeds of the debt financing will be used (i) to finance, in part, the payment of the amounts payable
under the merger agreement, to repay our indebtedness outstanding as of the closing of the merger and the payment of related fees and
expenses, (ii) to provide ongoing working capital and (iii) for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The aggregate
principal amount of the term loan facility funded on the closing date may be less than the aggregate principal amount of the term loan facility
committed by the applicable Lenders in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the debt commitment letter.

        The debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter is conditioned on the consummation of the merger in accordance with
the merger agreement, as well as other customary conditions, including, but not limited to:

• the execution and delivery by the borrowers and certain guarantors of definitive documentation consistent with the debt
commitment letter; 

• the accuracy of representations and warranties in the merger agreement as are material to the interests of the lenders under the
term loan facility, bridge facility and the ABL facilities to the extent the inaccuracy of such representations and warranties
would permit Parent to terminate the merger agreement or refuse to complete the merger, and the accuracy in all material
respects of certain specified representations and warranties in the loan documents; 

• the consummation of the equity financing prior to or substantially concurrently with the initial borrowing under the term loan
facility;

• receipt by the lead arrangers under the debt commitment letter of documentation and other information about the borrowers
and guarantors required under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations (including
the USA PATRIOT Act); 

• subject to certain limitations, the execution and delivery of guarantees by the guarantors and the taking of certain actions
necessary to establish and perfect a security interest in specified items of collateral; and 

• the completion of a marketing period to syndicate the term loan facility prior to the closing date, such marketing period to be
the first period of fifteen consecutive business days (subject to certain exceptions) after the date of the merger agreement
commencing on the first business day after Parent shall have received certain financial information specified in the debt
commitment letter which does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact regarding us or any of our subsidiaries or
omit to state any material fact regarding us or any of our subsidiaries required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make such information, in light of the circumstances under which the statements contained in such information are made, not
materially misleading.

        If any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the debt commitment letter, Parent
is required to promptly notify us in writing and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute financing on terms and conditions not
materially less favorable (including with respect to conditionality) to Parent and Merger Sub, taken as a whole, than the terms and conditions
of the debt commitment letter (including the "flex" provisions contained in the fee letter referenced in the debt commitment letter) in an
amount sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. As of the last
practicable date before the printing of this proxy statement, the debt commitment letter remains in effect. The documentation governing debt
financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter has not been finalized and, accordingly, the actual terms of the debt financing may
differ from those described in this proxy statement.

        The Lenders may invite other banks, financial institutions and institutional lenders to participate in the debt financing contemplated by
the debt commitment letter and to undertake a portion of the commitments to provide such debt financing.

Limited Guarantee 

        Pursuant to the limited guarantee delivered by the funds in favor of the Company, dated June 28, 2017, each fund has agreed to, severally
but not jointly, guarantee the due and punctual performance and discharge of such fund's respective percentage of the following (the
"guaranteed obligations"):

• the obligation of Parent under the merger agreement to pay the Parent termination fee to the Company as and when due, and 

• the expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent in connection with the costs and expenses incurred by
the Company in connection with (x) any suit to enforce the

payment of the Parent termination fee and (y) the arrangement of the financing for the merger, the repatriation of certain
foreign cash balances, actions with respect to the carveout transactions and actions with respect to the Company's outstanding
senior notes, as and when due.

        The liability of each guarantor is several and not joint and the obligations of each guarantor under the limited guarantee are limited to
such guarantor's pro rata percentage (as set forth for each guarantor in the limited guarantee) of the guaranteed obligations.

        Subject to certain exceptions, the guarantee will terminate upon the earliest of:

• the closing and the effective time of the merger, 

• the payment and satisfaction in full of the guaranteed obligations, and 

• the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms in circumstances where the Parent termination fee does
not become payable.

        The obligations of each of the guarantors will automatically expire six months after the valid termination of the merger agreement in
circumstances under which the Parent termination fee is payable, unless a claim for payment of the funds' liability thereunder in respect of
any of the obligations is brought pursuant to and in accordance with the guarantee prior to such expiration. In that case, the guarantee will
terminate upon the satisfaction in full of the guaranteed obligations or a final, non-appealable judgment that the Company is not entitled to
any amounts underlying the guaranteed obligations.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger 

        The closing of the merger will occur as soon as practicable (but in any event no later than the third business day) following the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement or at such other date as the parties may agree in
writing; provided that, if the marketing period (described below) has not ended at such time, then, subject to the continued satisfaction or
waiver of such closing conditions at such time, the closing shall occur instead on the earliest of (i) any business day during the marketing
period as may be specified by Parent on no less than three business days' prior written notice to the Company, (ii) the third business day
following the final day of the marketing period (which could be up to 21 business days following satisfaction of the closing conditions,
assuming satisfaction of the other marketing period requirements described below throughout such period) or (iii) such other date, time or
place as agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the
Delaware Secretary of State or at such subsequent time or date as Parent and the Company may agree and specify in the certificate of merger.
We intend to complete the merger as promptly as practicable, subject to receipt of the Company stockholder approval and satisfaction of the
other closing conditions. Although we currently expect to complete the merger during the third fiscal quarter of 2017, we cannot specify when
or assure you that all conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived.

Payment of Merger Consideration and Surrender of Stock Certificates 

        Promptly, and in any event within five business days, after the effective time of the merger, a letter of transmittal will be mailed to each
record holder of shares of Company common stock (other than the excluded shares) describing how such holder should surrender its shares of
Company common stock for the per share merger consideration.

        You should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock certificates to
the paying agent (described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Payment Procedures" beginning on page 100) without a
letter of transmittal.

Table of Contents

        If your shares of Company common stock are certificated, you will not be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration until you
deliver a duly completed and executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent and you must also surrender your stock certificate, or
certificates, to the paying agent. If your shares of Company common stock are held in book entry, which we refer to as uncertificated shares,
surrender of any uncertificated shares will be effected in accordance with the paying agent's customary procedures with respect to securities
that are uncertificated or represented by book entry and no holder of uncertificated shares will be required to deliver a certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent in order to receive the merger consideration to which such holder is otherwise entitled under
the merger agreement. If ownership of your shares is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be
delivered will only be issued if the applicable letter of transmittal is accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Company to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

        If you have lost a certificate, or if it has been stolen or destroyed, then before you will be entitled to receive the merger
consideration, you will have to make an affidavit of the loss, theft or destruction and, if reasonably required by Parent, post a bond in
such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent with
respect to such certificate. These procedures will be described in the letter of transmittal that you will receive, which you should read
carefully in its entirety.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that the Company's directors
and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally, as
more fully described below. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in reaching the determination
that the terms and conditions of the merger and the merger agreement were advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders and that the terms of the merger were fair to the Company and the Company's stockholders and in making their recommendation
regarding the adoption of the merger agreement as described in the section entitled "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation
of the Board" beginning on page 51.

        Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled "The Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation" beginning on page 89 for
additional information with respect to the compensation that our named executive officers and other executive officers may receive in
connection with the merger.

Interests with Respect to Company Equity 

Treatment of Company Stock Awards and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan

        Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, each then-outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of Company common stock with an exercise price per share equal to
or greater than the per share merger consideration will be canceled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and will have
no further force or effect. Because the current exercise price per share of each outstanding Company stock option is equal to or greater than
the merger consideration, all Company stock options will be canceled, without payment of any consideration therefor, and will have no
further force or effect.

        Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, (i) each Company restricted stock unit that will become vested, by its terms, as a result of the closing of the merger will automatically
be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount of cash equal to the

product of (A) the total number of shares of Company common stock then underlying such Company restricted stock unit multiplied by
(B) the per share merger consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, with such amount payable
promptly after the closing of the merger and (ii) each Company restricted stock unit that will not be vested, by its terms, on or before the
closing of the merger will automatically be canceled and converted into the contingent right to receive from the surviving corporation an
amount of cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company common stock then underlying such Company restricted
stock unit multiplied by (B) the per share merger consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, with
such amount payable promptly following the earlier of (1) the date on which the original vesting conditions applicable to such underlying
restricted stock unit, including and taking into account any accelerated vesting provisions set forth therein, are satisfied and (2) the date that is
180 days following the closing in each case, subject to the holder's continued service with the Company through the applicable date; provided
that the 180 day period referenced in clause (2) is extended to the earlier of (x) the last day of the tenth month following the closing and
(y) October 31, 2018, for certain Company restricted stock units granted in July 2017.

        Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, (i) each Company performance share award that is then outstanding and unvested and that is held by a former employee of the
Company (as determined immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to
receive from the surviving corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (A) the target number of shares of Company common stock
subject to such Company performance share award, as pro-rated in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company performance share
award agreement, multiplied by (B) the per share merger consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding,
with such amount payable promptly after the closing of the merger and (ii) each Company performance share award that is then outstanding
and unvested and that is held by a person who is an employee of the Company immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
automatically be canceled and converted into the contingent right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount of cash equal to the
product of (A) the target number of shares of Company common stock subject to such Company performance share award multiplied by
(B) the per share merger consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, with such amount payable
promptly following the earlier of (C) the date on which the original vesting conditions applicable to such performance share award, including
and taking into account any accelerated vesting provisions set forth therein, are satisfied and (D) the date that is 180 days following the
closing, in each case subject to the holder's continued service with the Company through the applicable date; provided that the merger
consideration payable in respect of the Company performance share awards will be paid no later than March 15 of the calendar year following
the calendar year in which the closing occurs.

        The exception to the above-described treatment of the equity awards that allows the holder and Parent to agree in writing to different
treatment would allow for the implementation of management rollover arrangements if Parent and any applicable holders mutually agreed to
such arrangements. However, no agreement or arrangement has been entered into or discussed in this regard.

        The Board has suspended the Company's employee stock purchase plan indefinitely effective as of July 1, 2017. The Board will
terminate the employee stock purchase plan as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. During the period from the date of the
merger agreement until the termination of the Company's employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the merger agreement, we will not
permit any offering periods to occur.

Table of Contents

Security Holdings of Certain Persons

        The following table sets forth, as of August 1, 2017, for each person who has served as a director or executive officer of the Company
since the beginning of our last fiscal year:

• the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Company common stock held directly and indirectly; 

• the pre-tax value of such outstanding shares of Company common stock based on the $10.25 per share merger consideration; 

• the aggregate number of Company restricted stock units held that may vest or otherwise be delivered in connection with the
merger; 

• the pre-tax value of such Company restricted stock units based on the $10.25 per share merger consideration; 

• the aggregate number of Company performance share awards held that may vest or otherwise be delivered in connection with
the merger (determined based on target performance, regardless of actual achievement of the performance metrics); 

• the pre-tax value of such Company performance share awards based on the $10.25 per share merger consideration; and 

• the aggregate pre-tax value of such shares of Company common stock, such Company restricted stock units and such
Company performance share awards (which is the sum of the third, fifth and seventh columns below).

        The estimated aggregate amounts set forth in the third, fifth and seventh columns below equal the product of (i) the $10.25 per share
merger consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company common stock subject to each applicable award as described
above. The following table assumes that the closing of the merger occurs on October 31, 2017, and the amounts shown do not attempt to
forecast any grants, dividends, deferrals or forfeitures following the date of the filing of this proxy statement, and depending upon when the
closing date occurs, certain of the equity-based awards in the table may vest in accordance with their existing terms. The following table does
not capture vesting that would occur between August 1, 2017 and the closing, and it does not include phantom stock held in the Company's
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. The following table also

merger agreement and applicable award agreements.

Severance Arrangements; Compensatory Arrangements Relating to the Merger 

        Pursuant to (i) the severance benefits agreements into which the Company has entered with each of its executive officers, (ii) the
restricted stock unit agreements into which the Company has entered with each of its executive officers under the Company's 2014 stock
incentive plan, which we refer to as the 2014 plan, and (iii) the performance share award agreements into which the Company has entered
with each of its executive officers under the 2014 plan, certain of the Company's executive officers are entitled to specified benefits in the
event of the termination of their employment under specified circumstances, including termination following a change in control of the
Company.

        The Company's severance benefits agreements provide that in the event an executive officer experiences a qualified termination (as such
term is defined below), such executive officer would be entitled to receive:

• continued base salary payments (at the rate in effect as of the termination date or at any higher rate in effect within the 90-day
period preceding the termination date) for a specified time period (the "severance period"); and

Table of Contents

        In addition, pursuant to Company policy, such executive officer would be entitled to continue to participate in the Company's group
health, dental and vision plans for the duration of the severance period and be charged only the rate applicable to current employees for such
coverage.

        In the event an executive officer experiences a qualified termination within two years of a "change in control" (as defined in the
severance benefits agreement), he or she would be entitled to receive the severance payments described in the preceding paragraph for a
severance period that is six months longer than if the executive officer experienced a qualified termination unrelated to a change in control.
Ms. Goodman also is entitled to receive, as an exit transition amount, a one-time lump sum cash payment on the date of her first payment of
severance in the amount of $40,000, which amount will be increased by 5% on each anniversary of June 13, 2016 that occurs before the exit
transition payment is due (but not beyond an amount equivalent to four months of salary). An executive officer's right to severance is
conditioned upon timely execution and non-revocation of a release and continued compliance with restrictive covenants.

        For purposes of the severance benefits agreement, a "qualified termination" is defined as a termination of employment for any reason
other than because of:

• the executive officer's death or disability; 

• a termination by the Company for "cause" (as defined below); or 

• a resignation or retirement by the executive officer without "good reason" (as defined below).

        Under the severance benefits agreement, "cause" means the executive officer's:

• willful failure to substantially perform duties with the Company (other than any failure resulting from incapacity due to
physical or mental illness); provided, however, that the Company has given a written demand for substantial performance,
which specifically identifies the areas in which performance is substandard, and the executive officer has not cured such
failure within 30 days after delivery of the demand; provided, further, that no act or failure to act will be deemed "willful"
unless the executive officer acted or failed to act without a good faith or reasonable belief that the conduct was in the
Company's best interest; 

• breach of any of the terms of a proprietary and confidential information, non-competition or other similar agreement between
the executive officer and the Company; 

• violation of the Company's code of ethics or attempt to secure any improper personal profit in connection with the business of
the Company; 

• failure to devote full working time to the affairs of the Company except as may be authorized in writing by the Company's
chief executive officer or other authorized Company official; 

• engaging in business other than the business of the Company except as may be authorized in writing by the Company's chief
executive officer or other authorized Company official; or 

• engaging in misconduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company;

provided that in each case the Company has given the executive officer written notice of its intent to terminate employment and an
opportunity to present, in person, to the Executive Vice President of Human Resources or any other authorized Company official, any
objections the executive officer may have to such termination.

Table of Contents

        Under the severance benefits agreement, "good reason" means the occurrence of any of the following conditions without the executive
officer's written consent, which condition results in a material negative change to the executive officer's employment relationship with the
Company:

• the executive officer's position, duties, responsibilities, power, title or office is significantly diminished (a change in the
executive officer's reporting relationship, standing alone, shall not be deemed significant); 

• the executive officer's annual base salary is reduced; 

• the executive officer is not allowed to participate in a cash bonus program in a manner substantially consistent with past
practice in light of the Company's financial performance and attainment of the executive officer's specified goals, or the
executive officer's participation in any other material compensation plan (other than any stock option or stock award program,
which programs are within the Compensation Committee's full discretion) is substantially reduced, both in terms of the
amount of benefits provided and the level of participation relative to other participants; 

• the executive officer is not provided with paid vacation or other benefits substantially similar to those enjoyed by the executive
officer under any of the Company's medical, dental, life insurance, or disability plans in which the executive officer was
participating, or the Company takes any action which would directly or indirectly materially reduce any of such benefits or the
number of the executive officer's paid vacation days; 

• in the event of a change in control, the Company or any person in control of the Company requires the executive officer to
perform his or her principal duties in a new location outside a radius (measured from the executive officer's primary residence)
that is extended an additional 50 miles further from the executive officer's primary residence at the time of the change in
control; or 

• the Company fails to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor to assume and agree to perform the severance benefit
agreement.

        In order to terminate his or her employment for "good reason," the executive officer must provide notice to the Company within 90 days
of the initial occurrence of the alleged condition; the Company must fail to cure the condition within 30 days of the executive officer's notice;
and the executive officer must resign within 180 days of providing the original notice to the Company.

        In connection with the merger, the Company intends to amend its severance benefits agreements with its executive officers to provide
that the Company may not terminate such agreements within two years after the closing of a change in control (including the merger) and to
ensure successors and transferees of the businesses or assets of the Company are obligated under the agreements through such extended term.
Otherwise, the severance benefits agreements will remain in effect in accordance with their existing terms.

        Generally, the Company's forms of equity award agreements for employees, including the Company's executive officers, provide for
vesting acceleration on a "double trigger" basis, and a change in control does not itself trigger acceleration of vesting:

• the Company's restricted stock unit agreements under the 2014 plan provide that such awards will become immediately vested
in full, and the shares of common stock to be received upon settlement of the award will be issued if, on or prior to the first
anniversary of the consummation of a change in control the executive officer's employment is terminated for "good reason" (as
defined below) by the executive officer or is terminated without "cause" (as defined below) by the Company; and

• the Company's performance share award agreements under the 2014 plan provide that the greater of (i) the number of shares of
Company common stock underlying the performance share award assuming performance is achieved at target and (ii) the
number of shares determined to be issuable based on actual performance, will be issued to the performance share award holder
if, within one year following the closing of a change in control, but before the board meeting at which performance under the
award would otherwise be established, the executive officer's employment is terminated for "good reason" by the executive
officer or is terminated without "cause" by the Company.

        Under the restricted stock unit and performance share award agreements, "cause" means the award recipient's:

• willful failure to substantially perform duties with the Company (other than any failure resulting from incapacity due to
physical or mental illness); provided, however, that the Company has given a written demand for substantial performance,
which specifically identifies the areas in which performance is substandard, and the recipient has not cured such failure within
30 days after delivery of the demand; provided, further, that no act or failure to act will be deemed "willful" unless the
recipient acted or failed to act without a good faith or reasonable belief that the conduct was in the Company's best interest; 

• breach of any of the terms of an employment, consulting, advisory, proprietary and confidential information, non-competition
or other similar agreement between the recipient and the Company; 

• violation of the Company's code of ethics; 

• engaging in intentional deceitful act(s) that results in an improper personal benefit or injury to the Company; 

• engaging in fraud or willful misconduct (not acting in good faith or with reasonable belief that conduct was in the best
interests of the Company) that significantly contributes to the Company preparing a material financial restatement, other than a
restatement of financial statements that became materially inaccurate because of revisions to generally accepted accounting
principles; 

• failure to devote full working time to the affairs of the Company except as may be authorized in writing by the Company's
chief executive officer or other authorized Company official; 

• engaging in business other than the business of the Company except as may be authorized in writing by the Company's chief
executive officer or other authorized Company official; or 

• engaging in misconduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company.

        For the purposes of the definition of "cause" contained in the restricted stock unit and performance share award agreements, any
reference to the Company includes any entity that the Company directly or indirectly controls.

        Under the restricted stock unit and performance share award agreements, "good reason" means:

• a material diminution in the recipient's duties, authority, and responsibilities; 

• a material reduction in the recipient's base compensation; or 

• the relocation of the recipient's principal place of employment by more than an additional 50 miles further from the recipient's
primary residence at the time of the change in control.

        In order to terminate his or her employment for "good reason," the recipient must provide notice to the Company within 60 days of the
event triggering good reason; the Company must have 30 days

following receipt of such notice to cure such event; and the recipient must actually terminate employment with the Company within 6 months
of providing the original notice to the Company.

        Notwithstanding the terms of the restricted stock unit award agreements and the performance share award agreements, pursuant to the
merger agreement, payments of merger consideration for Company restricted stock units and Company performance share awards (at target)
will generally be paid promptly following the earlier of:

• the date on which the original vesting conditions applicable to such underlying restricted stock unit, including and taking into
account the accelerated vesting provisions set forth in the award agreement, are satisfied; and 

• the date that is 180 days following the closing (provided that the merger consideration payable in respect of Company
performance share awards will not be paid later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
closing occurs), subject, in each case, to the holder's continued service with the Company through the applicable date.

        In October 2015, the Company adopted a policy pursuant to which the Company would not pay severance benefits under an employment
or severance agreement with an executive officer to the extent that they exceed 2.99 times the sum of the executive's base salary plus target
annual cash incentive award, without first seeking stockholder approval (the "Cash Severance Policy"). "Severance benefits" under the policy
are limited to the following cash payments paid in connection with a termination of employment (other than due to death or permanent
disability):

• payments representing continued salary, whether paid in a lump sum or over time; 

• payments representing bonus amounts, based on a multiple of amounts earned or paid in prior years, whether paid in a lump
sum or over time; 

• payments in lieu of continued benefits (including any perquisites); and 

• payments to offset the tax liability in respect of any of the foregoing.

        Further, effective March 2011, the Company adopted a policy pursuant to which it would not enter into any future compensation,
severance or employment related agreement that provides for a gross up payment to cover taxes triggered by a change in control, including
taxes payable under Section 4999 of the Code (the "Gross Up Policy").

        In analyzing the severance and other payments that could be made to the named executive officers in connection with the merger, the
Company confirmed that the amount of any "severance benefits," as defined under the Cash Severance Policy, would not exceed the 2.99x
limitation set forth in such policy. The Company also determined that the design of the Company's performance share awards, which require
that the awards be settled based on target level of achievement of the performance goals if the named executive officer's employment is
terminated without cause or for good reason within one year following a change in control but before performance under the award would
otherwise be established, together with the Company's dependence on performance share awards as a significant component of the named
executive officer's compensation, could cause the named executive officers to become subject to the parachute payment provisions of
Section 280G of the Code and the related excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code (the "Parachute Provisions"). If applicable, the Parachute
Provisions could result in the imposition of a 20% excise tax on a portion of both the cash (and non-cash) severance payments and the equity-
based payments that may be made to the named executive officers in connection with the merger and/or a qualified termination or termination
without cause or for good reason following the merger.

        In assessing the effect of the Parachute Provisions on the named executive officers, the Company engaged a national accounting firm
which determined that the value of the noncompetition provisions

to which named executive officers are subject in connection with a qualified termination (as defined under the severance benefits agreement)
or a termination without cause or for good reason (as defined under the restricted stock unit and performance share unit award agreements)
could offset in full the application of the Parachute Provisions to the named executive officers. As a result, to the extent that the named
executive officer had, and exercised, "good reason" to terminate his or her employment following the merger, the named executive officer
would likely not be subject to the Parachute Provisions. However, it is possible that if the named executive officer does not exercise his or her
"good reason" resignation rights, or does not otherwise have a qualified termination (as defined under the severance benefits agreement) or
termination without cause or for good reason (as defined under the restricted stock unit and performance share unit award agreements), that he
or she could be subject to the adverse consequences under the Parachute Provisions.

        Because the Board believes it is important to retain the named executive officers through the closing of the merger and not to create an
incentive to exercise good reason rights immediately following the merger, notwithstanding the Cash Severance Policy and the Gross Up
Policy, the Company intends to enter into arrangements with up to eight individuals who may receive "excess parachute payments" (as that
term is defined by Section 280G of the Code), three of whom may be Ms. Goodman, Ms. Komola and Mr. Williams (who are three of our
named executive officers), to pay to each such individual an amount sufficient to "gross up" such individual (in whole or in part) for any
excise taxes that may become payable by such individual pursuant to the Parachute Provisions (estimated to be not more than $13,021,401 in
the aggregate for the three named executive officers and, in any event, in an aggregate amount for all eight individuals not to exceed
$20,704,118). We refer to these payments as the Section 280G gross up payments. The Company continues to engage with the national
accounting firm to determine whether any portion of the equity-based payments that may be made to the named executive officers in
connection with the merger could be treated as reasonable compensation for services before or after the merger (which would allow such
payments to be excluded from the Parachute Provision calculations) in an effort to mitigate the amount of the Section 280G gross up
payments that may become payable.

        Please see the section of this proxy statement entitled "The Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation" beginning on page 89 for an
estimate of the value of the amounts that would be payable to each of our named executive officers pursuant to the arrangements listed above,
assuming that the closing of the merger occurred on October 31, 2017 and that each named executive officer's employment (other than the
employment of Messrs. Doody, Sargent and Wilson) terminated on such date in a manner that would entitled such named executive officer to
the maximum severance benefits described above.

Employee Benefits 

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, from and after the effective time of the merger, Parent must cause the surviving corporation and its
subsidiaries to assume, in accordance with their terms, all Company obligations under contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans
and commitments of the Company and its subsidiaries that are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company or
any subsidiary of the Company, including any employment, severance and termination plans and agreements in each case in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately before the merger agreement was signed and in the form provided to Parent prior to the date on which the
merger agreement was signed.

Table of Contents

        For a period of one year following the effective time of the merger (or, if shorter, the period of employment of the relevant employee),
Parent must provide, or must cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company or its subsidiaries:

• a total compensation package no less favorable than the total compensation package (including base salary or wage rates,
commissions and target annual cash bonus opportunities but excluding the value of annual equity awards and cash payments in
lieu of equity awards) provided to such employee immediately before the effective time of the merger; and 

• other employee benefits (other than an employee stock purchase plan, long-term incentive or defined benefit pension or equity
awards or cash payments in lieu of equity awards) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other benefits
provided to such employees immediately before the effective time of the merger.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, employees located outside the United States or covered by collective bargaining agreements will be
treated instead in accordance with applicable contracts (after taking into account the assumptions of contracts described above) and applicable
law.

        For a more detailed description of these provisions of the merger agreement, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled "The
Merger Agreement—Additional Agreements of the Parties to the Merger Agreement—Employee Benefits Matters" on page 116.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers 

        For six years following the effective time of the merger, Parent and the Company have agreed that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of the merger agreement, or
who becomes prior to the effective time of the merger, an officer, manager or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, who we refer
to as an indemnified party, whether provided in the organizational documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or in any
indemnification agreement between any indemnified party and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, will survive the merger and continue in
full force and effect, and may not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder
of any indemnified party.

        For six years following the effective time of the merger, Parent and the surviving corporation have agreed to maintain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the
Company and its subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time of the
merger as contained in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company in effect on the date of the merger agreement.

        Parent has also agreed to either:

• maintain in effect for six years from the effective time of the merger the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger (including the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement), so long as the annual premiums would not exceed more than 300% of the
current annual premium paid for the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, which we refer to as the
Maximum Premium; or 

• purchase a "tail" policy for an annual cost not to exceed the Maximum Premium and maintain such "tail" policy in full force
and effect for six years from the effective time of the merger.

Table of Contents

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, prior to the effective time of the merger, elect to purchase its own "tail" policy using a
nationally recognized broker selected by Parent in consultation with the Company, as long as such "tail" policy does not cost more than the
Maximum Premium.

Merger Agreement—Additional Agreements of the Parties to the Merger Agreement—Indemnification" on page 114.

Intent to Vote in Favor of the Merger 

        As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
1,915,031 shares of Company common stock, representing 0.3% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock on the record date. The
directors and executive officers have informed the Company that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of Company common stock
"FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, "FOR" approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute"
compensation and "FOR" the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Golden Parachute Compensation 

        The Company has adopted the Cash Severance Policy and the Gross Up Policy, each described above in the section entitled "Interests of
Certain Persons in the Merger—Severance Arrangements; Compensatory Arrangements Relating to the Merger."

        In analyzing the severance and other payments that could be made to the named executive officers in connection with the merger, the
Company confirmed that the amount of any "severance benefits," as defined under the Cash Severance Policy, would not exceed the 2.99x
limitation set forth in such policy. The Company also determined that the design of the Company's performance share awards, which require
that the awards be settled based on target level of achievement of the performance goals if the named executive officer's employment is
terminated without cause or for good reason within one year following a change in control but before performance under the award would
otherwise be established, together with the Company's dependence on performance share awards as a significant component of the named
executive officer's compensation, could cause the named executive officers to become subject to the Parachute Provisions. If applicable, the
Parachute Provisions could result in the imposition of a 20% excise tax on a portion of both the cash (and non-cash) severance payments and
the equity-based payments that may be made to the named executive officers in connection with the merger and/or a qualified termination or
termination without cause or for good reason following the merger.

        In assessing the effect of the Parachute Provisions on the named executive officers, the Company engaged a national accounting firm
which determined that the value of the noncompetition provisions to which named executive officers are subject in connection with a
qualified termination (as defined in the severance benefits agreement) or a termination without cause or for good reason (as defined under the
restricted stock unit and performance share unit award agreements) could offset in full the application of the Parachute Provisions to the
named executive officers. As a result, to the extent that the named executive officer had, and exercised, "good reason" to terminate his or her
employment following the merger, the named executive officer would likely not be subject to the Parachute Provisions. However, it is

Parachute Provisions.

        Because the Board believes it is important to retain the named executive officers through the closing of the merger and not to create an

Gross Up Policy, the Company intends to enter into arrangements with up to eight individuals who may receive "excess parachute payments"

connection with the merger could be treated as reasonable compensation for services before or after the merger (which would allow such
payments to be excluded from the Parachute Provision calculations) in an effort to mitigate the amount of the Section 280G gross up
payments that may become payable.

        The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for our named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, assuming that the merger was consummated on October 31, 2017, and
that each named executive officer's employment (other than the employment of Messrs. Sargent and Wilson, whose employment has already
terminated, and the employment of Mr. Doody, who will retire before the consummation of the merger) was terminated on the same day, such
that he or she experienced a qualified termination within two years of a change in control under his or her severance benefits agreement.

        The table below describes the estimated potential payments to each of our named executive officers under the terms of their respective
severance benefits agreements as they may have been amended from time to time, including, in the case of Ms. Goodman, by that certain
letter agreement between the Company and Ms. Goodman dated June 13, 2016, together with the value of the unvested Company restricted
stock units and Company performance shares that would be accelerated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. The amounts
shown in the table do not include the value of payments or benefits that would have been earned, or any amounts associated with equity
awards that would vest pursuant to their terms, on or prior to the effective date of the merger or the value of payments or benefits that are not
based on or otherwise related to the merger.

        For purposes of calculating the potential payments set forth in the table below, we have assumed that (a) the merger shall become
effective on, and the date of termination of employment of the named executive officer (other than for Messrs. Doody, Sargent and Wilson) is,
October 31, 2017; (b) the stock price is $10.25 per share, which is the per share merger consideration; and (c) no withholding taxes are
applicable to any payments set forth in the table. The amounts shown in the table are estimates only and are based on assumptions and
information available to date. The actual amounts

(1) The amount listed in this column represents cash severance payments which are "double-trigger" and payable upon a
qualified termination that occurs within two years of the consummation of change in control. For this purpose, a
"qualified termination" is defined as a termination of employment for any reason other than because of (a) the executive
officer's death or disability, (b) a termination by the Company for cause, or (c) a resignation or retirement by the
executive without good reason, as such terms are defined in the severance benefits agreement. Cash severance payments
are paid in equal weekly installments over the course of the named executive officer's severance period. The severance
period is 30 months for Ms. Goodman, 12 months for Mr. Conte and 18 months for each of Ms. Komola and
Mr. Williams. Each weekly payment is equal to the sum of (i) the named executive officer's annualized base salary rate
in effect immediately prior to the qualified termination (or any higher rate in effect within the 90 days prior to notice of
termination under the agreement) divided by 52 weeks plus (ii) one-fifty-second of the average annual bonus paid to the
named executive officer by Staples during the three full fiscal years preceding the qualified termination. Ms. Goodman
also is entitled to receive, as an exit transition amount, a one-time lump sum cash payment on the date of her first
payment of severance in the amount of $40,000, which amount will be increased by 5% on each anniversary of June 13,
2016 that occurs before the exit transition payment is due (but not beyond an amount equivalent to four months of
salary); accordingly, the amount of Ms. Goodman's transition payment would equal $42,000, assuming a qualified
termination on October 31, 2017. 

The annualized base salary rate and average annual bonus over the last three fiscal years for each named executive
officer entitled to severance under a severance benefits agreement effective as of the closing date of the merger is:

Named executive officers are not entitled to any severance benefits under their severance benefits agreements if the
Company determines, within 60 days following the named executive officer's termination, that his or her conduct prior
to termination would have warranted a discharge for cause (as defined in the severance benefits agreement), or if,
during the severance period, the named executive officer violates the terms of any non-competition or confidentiality
provision contained in any employment, consulting, advisory, non-disclosure, non-competition or other similar
agreement between the named executive officer and the Company.

Messrs. Doody, Sargent and Wilson are not party to agreements with the Company pursuant to which they would be
entitled to severance payments from the Company in connection with the merger. 

(2) The amount listed in this column represents, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the payments in
cancellation of (i) Company restricted stock units held by each named executive officer, calculated as the product of
(A) the merger consideration of $10.25 per share of Company common stock multiplied by (B) the number of Company
restricted stock units being canceled and (ii) Company performance share awards held by each named executive officer,
calculated as the product of (A) the merger consideration of $10.25 per share of Company common stock multiplied by
(B) the number of shares underlying the Company performance share award being cancelled, with performance deemed
achieved at target. Amounts payable to Messrs. Doody, Sargent and Wilson will be paid promptly after the closing of
the merger and are single-trigger in nature. Amounts payable to Ms. Goodman, Ms. Komola and Messrs. Conte and
Williams will be paid promptly following the earlier of (A) the date on which the original vesting conditions applicable
to such underlying restricted stock unit or performance share award, including and taking into account any accelerated
vesting provisions set forth therein, are satisfied and (B) the date that is 180 days following the closing (provided that
no payments in respect of Company performance share awards will be made later than March 15 of the year following
the year in which the merger is consummated), in each case, subject to the holder's continued service with the Company
through the applicable date. 

These payments in respect of equity awards held by Ms. Goodman, Ms. Komola, and Messrs. Conte and Williams are
"double-trigger" benefits to the extent they are paid in accordance with the accelerated vesting provisions set forth in the
applicable award agreements (which generally provide for vesting in full in the event of the holder's termination of
employment by the Company without "cause" or by the holder for "good reason" within one year following a change in
control, as those terms are defined in the applicable award agreement). However, the payments would be "single-
trigger" benefits to the extent they are paid out promptly following the closing or the date that is 180 days following the
closing (or, in the case of Company performance share awards, by March 15 of the year following the year in which the
merger is consummated). 

The number of Company restricted stock units and Company performance share awards held by each named executive
officer to be treated as described in this column are as follows:

(3) The amount listed in this column represents the Company's cost to forgo charging the executive officers any amount in
excess of the employee-side premiums under COBRA for group health, dental and vision coverage for a period of time
following the executive officer's termination of employment, as follows: 18 months for Ms. Goodman and Mr. Williams
and 12 months for Mr. Conte. Ms. Komola would also be entitled to 18 months were she to become covered by the
Company's group health, dental and vision coverage. The foregoing subsidy is "double-trigger" in nature and payable
only upon a qualified termination.

Accounting Treatment 

        The merger will be accounted for as a "purchase transaction" for financial accounting purposes.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to "U.S. holders" and certain "non-U.S. holders"
(both terms defined below) whose shares of our common stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This
summary is for information purposes only and is not tax advice. It does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that
might be relevant for holders of our common stock. This summary is based on the Code the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated
under the Code, published rulings by the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, and judicial authorities and administrative
decisions, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with
retroactive effect. Any such change could alter the tax consequences to the holders described herein. This summary is not binding on the IRS
or a court, and there can be no assurance that the tax consequences described in this summary will not be challenged by the IRS or that they
would be sustained by a court if so challenged. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no opinion of counsel has been or will
be rendered, as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.

(4) The range listed in this column represents the estimated minimum and maximum amount of the Section 280G gross up
payment the named executive officer may be entitled to receive in accordance with gross-up arrangements expected to
be put in place by the Company prior to the effective time of the merger, assuming that the closing of the merger occurs
on October 31, 2017, that the named executive officer's employment terminates on that date, and that current interest
and tax rates apply. The actual amounts of the Section 280G gross up payments depends on whether, and to what extent,
excise taxes pursuant to the Parachute Provisions become due, which will depend on a number of factors including the
actual effective date of the merger, whether a named executive officer is terminated and the date of such termination,
whether a named executive officer agrees with Parent in writing that his or her equity compensation will be treated in a
manner other than as described in the merger agreement, interest rates and tax rates. In addition, the actual amounts of
the Section 280G gross up payments may be reduced based on the value of any noncompetition agreement and/or
certain amounts that may be valued as reasonable compensation for services performed by the named executive officer
either before or after the effective time of the merger. The Company has not yet entered into the gross-up arrangements
with any of the named executive officers and the actual Section 280G gross up payments may increase if the
assumptions underlying the calculation of the range in the table above are different from the actual circumstances.
Accordingly, the maximum value of the Section 280G gross up payment payable under the definitive arrangement may
be higher than the range set forth in the table. However, the Board has stipulated that the aggregate amount of the
Section 280G gross up payments to the eight individuals eligible to receive such payments (including Ms. Goodman,
Ms. Komola and Mr. Williams) shall not exceed $20,704,118. These payments, which shall be made in one or more
lump sum payments, are (i) "single-trigger" in nature, insofar as they relate to excise taxes imposed under Section 4999
of the Code on the equity acceleration provided for under the merger agreement and merger consideration paid to the
named executive officer in respect of Company performance share awards, and (ii) "double-trigger" in nature, insofar as
they relate to the excise taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Code on severance payments and continuation of
benefits which would be paid following an executive officer's qualified termination within two years of the change in
control.

Table of Contents

        For purposes of this summary, the term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

• a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia; 

• a trust that (a) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more U.S.
persons or (b) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or 

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

        As used herein, a "non-U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor an entity or
arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our common
stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner of a
partnership holding our common stock should consult the partner's tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger to such partner.

        This summary applies only to holders who hold shares of our common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Code (generally, property held for investment), and does not address or consider all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be
applicable to holders of our common stock in light of their particular circumstances. For instance, this summary does not address the
alternative minimum tax or the tax consequences to stockholders who validly exercise dissenters' rights under the DGCL. In addition, this
summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders who are subject to special treatment under U.S.
federal income tax rules, including, for example, banks and other financial institutions; insurance companies; securities dealers or broker-
dealers; mutual funds; traders in securities who elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting; tax-exempt investors; S corporations;
holders classified as partnerships or other flow-through entities under the Code; U.S. expatriates; holders who hold their shares of our
common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion transaction, or other integrated investment or constructive sale transaction; holders
whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; holders who acquired their shares of our common stock through the exercise of Company
stock options or otherwise as compensation; and, except to the extent described below, holders who actually or constructively own 5% or
more of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, this summary does not address the impact of the Medicare contribution tax,
any aspects of foreign, state, local, estate, gift, or other tax laws (or any U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax) that
may be applicable to a particular holder in connection with the merger.

        Further, this summary does not address any tax consequences of the merger to holders of restricted stock units or performance shares
whose restricted stock units or performance shares are cancelled in exchange for cash pursuant to the merger. Such restricted stock unit or
performance share holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the merger to them. Moreover, this summary
does not discuss any other matters relating to equity compensation or benefit plans (including our 401(k) plan).

U.S. Holders 

        A U.S. holder's receipt of the per share merger consideration in exchange for shares of our common stock will generally be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general,

Table of Contents

a U.S. holder whose shares of common stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger will recognize capital gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received (determined
before deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares. A
U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis will generally equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares. The amount of gain or loss must be
determined separately for each block of shares (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) surrendered by the U.S. holder in
the merger. Such gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder's holding period for such shares is more than
12 months at the effective time of the merger. Long-term capital gains recognized by individual and certain other non-corporate U.S. holders
are generally taxed at preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. A U.S. holder's ability to deduct capital losses may be limited.

Non-U.S. Holders 

        Cash received in the merger by a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. withholding tax (other than potentially to backup
withholding tax, as discussed below) and will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

• the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if an income tax
treaty applies, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such non-U.S. holder), in
which case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as if it were a U.S. holder,
and, if the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, such gain may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate
of 30% or at such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty; 

• the non-U.S. holder is an individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the
merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to a 30% tax (or such
lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty between the United States and such holder's country of
residence) on the net gain derived from the disposition, which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital losses of the non-
U.S. holder recognized in the taxable year of the disposition, if any; or 

• the Company was a "United States real property holding corporation," which we refer to as a USRPHC, within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the five years preceding the merger and the non-
U.S. holder owned, actually or constructively, more than 5% of the Company common stock at any time during the five-year
period preceding the merger. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its "U.S. real property interests"
equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or
held for use in a trade or business. Although there can be no assurances in this regard, the Company does not believe it is, or
has been during the five years preceding the merger, a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of the merger.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting 

        A U.S. holder may be subject to backup withholding on all payments to which such U.S. holder is entitled in connection with the merger,
unless the U.S. holder provides its correct taxpayer identification number and complies with applicable certification procedures or otherwise
establishes an

Table of Contents

exemption from backup withholding. In addition, if the paying agent is not provided with a U.S. holder's correct taxpayer identification
number or other adequate basis for exemption, the U.S. holder may be subject to certain penalties imposed by the IRS. Each U.S. holder
should complete and sign the IRS Form W-9 included as part of the letter of transmittal and timely return it to the paying agent in order to
avoid backup withholding, unless an exemption applies and is established in a manner satisfactory to the paying agent.

        Certain non-U.S. holders may also be subject to backup withholding unless they establish an exemption from backup withholding in a
manner satisfactory to the paying agent (such as by completing and signing an appropriate IRS Form W-8) and otherwise comply with the
backup withholding rules. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding these matters.

        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will generally be
allowable as a refund or credit against a holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that certain required information is timely
furnished to the IRS.

        Payments made pursuant to the merger will also be subject to information reporting unless an exemption applies.

        This summary is provided for general information only and is not tax advice. The U.S. federal income tax consequences
described above are not intended to constitute a complete description of all tax consequences relating to the merger. Because
individual circumstances may differ, each stockholder should consult the stockholder's tax advisor regarding the applicability of the
rules discussed above to the stockholder and the particular tax effects to the stockholder of the merger in light of such stockholder's
particular circumstances and the application of state, local, foreign, estate, gift and other tax laws (or any U.S. federal tax laws other
than those pertaining to income tax).

Regulatory Approvals 

        The merger is subject to the reporting and waiting period requirements of the HSR Act. On July 26, 2017, the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the merger. The merger agreement also
provides that the merger may be subject to the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under other applicable antitrust laws
identified by the parties. The parties initially identified the Canadian Competition Act under this provision; however, following further
analysis after the announcement of the transaction, the parties have agreed that no filling or clearance under such act is required and that such
act is not applicable within the meaning of the merger agreement. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the merger cannot be
consummated if any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any order, executive
order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction (temporary, preliminary or permanent) or statute, rule or regulation which has the effect of making
the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting, restraining, preventing or enjoining consummation of the merger.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PROPOSAL ONE) 

        The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The description in this section and elsewhere
in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as
Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of
the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its
entirety because it is the legal document that governs the merger.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement 

        The merger agreement is included to provide you with information regarding its terms. Factual disclosures about the Company contained
in this proxy statement or in the Company's public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures about
the Company contained in the merger agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants made in the merger agreement by the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub were qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub in
connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in
the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated
with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate
the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and
allocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing as facts the matters described therein. The representations
and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and
reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by the matters contained in a disclosure schedule that the
Company delivered to Parent in connection with the merger agreement, which we refer to as the Company Disclosure Schedule and which
disclosures are not reflected in the merger agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and
warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the merger
agreement, and such subsequent developments or new information may not be included in this proxy statement.

The Merger 

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, will merge
with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation of the merger. As a result of the merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. We sometimes refer to the
Company after the consummation of the merger as the surviving corporation. The certificate of incorporation of the Company will be
amended and restated in its entirety by virtue of the merger, to read as set forth on an exhibit to the merger agreement. The by-laws of the
Company will also be amended and restated in their entirety so that, immediately following the effective time of the merger, they are identical
to the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, except that all references to the name of
Merger Sub will be changed to refer to the Company. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
be the initial directors of the surviving corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
the initial officers of the surviving corporation.

Table of Contents

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger 

        The closing of the merger will occur as soon as practicable (but in any event no later than the third business day) following the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement or at such other date as the parties may agree in
writing; provided that, if the marketing period (described below) has not ended at such time, then, subject to the continued satisfaction or
waiver of such closing conditions at such time, the closing shall occur instead on the earliest of (i) any business day during the marketing
period as may be specified by Parent on no less than three business days' prior written notice to the Company, (ii) the third business day
following the final day of the marketing period (which could be up to 21 business days following satisfaction of the closing conditions,
assuming satisfaction of the other marketing period requirements described below throughout such period) or (iii) such other date, time or
place as agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the
Delaware Secretary of State or at such subsequent time or date as Parent and the Company may agree and specify in the certificate of merger.
We intend to complete the merger as promptly as practicable, subject to receipt of the Company stockholder approval and satisfaction of the
other closing conditions. Although we currently expect to complete the merger during the third fiscal quarter of 2017, we cannot specify when
or assure you that all conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived.

Marketing Period 

        The "marketing period" refers to the first period of 18 consecutive business days throughout which both:

• Parent will have certain financial information and other customary business and financial data that is requested by Parent to
market, syndicate and consummate the debt financing, which information we refer to as required financial information, and
such required financial information will be compliant (as described below); and 

• the closing conditions of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their nature can only be satisfied at the closing) and nothing shall have occurred and no condition shall exist that would
cause any of the other closing conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to fail to be satisfied, assuming that the date of
the closing were to be scheduled for any time during such 18 consecutive business day period.

        With respect to the required financial information, the term "compliant" means such required financial information that:

• taken as a whole, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order
to make such required financial information not misleading; 

• is compliant in all material respects with all applicable requirements of Regulations S-K and S-X under the Securities Act
applicable to offerings of debt securities on a registration statement on Form S-1 (other than such provisions for which
compliance is not customary in a Rule 144A offering of high yield debt securities); 

• the Company's auditors have not objected to the use of their audit opinions related to any audited financial statements included
in such required financial information and any interim quarterly financial statements included in such required financial
information have been reviewed by the Company's independent auditors; and 

• the Company's auditors are prepared to issue an agreed upon form of comfort letter with respect to the required financial
information when customarily required to be delivered during the marketing period.

Table of Contents

        The marketing period will not be deemed to commence if, prior to the completion of the marketing period:

• our auditors have withdrawn their audit opinion contained in the required financial information; 

• the Company issues a public statement indicating its intent to restate any historical financial statements of the Company or that
any such restatement is under consideration or may be a possibility, in which case the marketing period will not be deemed to
commence unless and until such restatement has been completed and the relevant financial statements have been amended or
the Company has announced that it has concluded that no restatement shall be required in accordance with GAAP; 

• the Company has been delinquent in filing any Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in which
case the marketing period will not be deemed to commence unless and until all such delinquencies have been cured; or 

• the required financial information ceases to be compliant (as described above) or would be required to be updated in order to
be compliant on any day during such 18 consecutive business day period, in which case the marketing period will not be
deemed to commence until the receipt by Parent of such compliant updated required financial information.

        The marketing period will end on any earlier date on which all of the debt financing or any alternative financing pursuant to the terms of
the merger agreement is obtained.

        If we reasonably believe we have delivered the applicable required financial information, we may deliver to Parent a written notice to
that effect (stating when we believe we completed such delivery), in which case the marketing period will be deemed to have commenced on
the date specified in that notice unless Parent reasonably believes we have not completed delivery of the required financial information and,
within two business days after the delivery of such notice by us, delivers written notice to us to that effect (stating with reasonable specificity
which required financial information Parent reasonably believes we have not delivered).

Merger Consideration 

        At the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of Company common stock, other than the dissenting shares and
the cancelled shares, will be canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive $10.25 in cash, without interest and subject to
deduction for any required withholding tax, which we refer to as the merger consideration or the per share merger consideration.

        The merger consideration will be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company common stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to Company common stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date of the merger agreement
and prior to the effective time.

        Any shares of Company common stock that are held in the treasury of the Company and any shares of Company common stock owned
any subsidiary of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent will be canceled and no consideration will be paid for such
shares.

        Any dissenting shares will be entitled to the rights granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. These rights are discussed more fully under the
section of this proxy statement entitled "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 138.

Payment Procedures 

        At or prior to the effective time of the merger, Parent will enter into an agreement (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company) with a paying agent for the merger, which we refer to as the paying agent, for the paying agent to act in such capacity for the
merger and cause to be deposited with the paying agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company common stock outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration, which we refer
to as the aggregate merger consideration, pursuant to the merger agreement, which we refer to as the payment fund. The payment fund may
not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments to stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement. The payment fund will be invested
by the paying agent as directed by Parent, except that these investments must be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, or
in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based
on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available). No gain or loss on the payment fund will affect the
amounts payable under the merger agreement and Parent must take all actions necessary to ensure that the payment fund includes at all times
cash sufficient to satisfy Parent's obligation to pay the aggregate merger consideration under the merger agreement. Any interest and other
income resulting from these investments (net of any losses) will be paid to Parent upon termination of the payment fund in accordance with
the merger agreement. In the event the payment fund is diminished below the level required for the paying agent to make prompt cash
payments as required under the merger agreement, Parent must, or must cause the surviving corporation to, immediately deposit additional
cash into the payment fund equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payments.

        Within five business days after the effective time, Parent will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
representing shares of Company common stock, which we refer to as a certificate, a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the certificates in exchange for the merger consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a certificate to the
paying agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such certificate will be promptly paid in
exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the number of shares of Company common stock formerly
represented by such certificate multiplied by the merger consideration, and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

        Any holder of uncertificated shares that immediately prior to the effective time represented shares of Company common stock, which we
refer to as uncertificated shares, will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the paying agent to receive
the merger consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the merger agreement. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one
or more uncertificated shares will, upon receipt by the paying agent of an "agent's message" in customary form with respect to any
uncertificated share (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the paying agent may reasonably request), be promptly paid the merger
consideration in respect of such uncertificated share, and such uncertificated share shall forthwith be cancelled.

        No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of certificates or uncertificated chares. In the event of a

consideration with respect thereto may be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the certificate or uncertificated shares is

time after the effective time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the merger consideration as contemplated by the merger
agreement.

        All merger consideration paid upon the surrender of certificates and cancellation of uncertificated shares in accordance with the terms of
the merger agreement will be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company common stock
formerly represented by such certificates and uncertificated shares, and from and after the effective time there will be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the surviving corporation of the shares of Company common stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time. If, after the effective time, certificates or uncertificated shares are presented to the surviving
corporation or the paying agent for any reason, they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in the merger agreement.

        Any portion of the payment fund that remains undistributed to the holders of certificates and uncertificated shares for one year after the
effective time (including all interest and other income received by the paying agent in respect of all funds made available to it) will be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a certificate or uncertificated shares who has not previously complied with the merger
agreement will be entitled to receive only from Parent or the surviving corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar
laws) payment of its claim for merger consideration, without interest.

        To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the surviving corporation or the paying agent will
be liable to any holder of shares of Company common stock for any amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any certificates or uncertificated shares shall not have been surrendered prior to the
date on which the related merger consideration would escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity, any such merger
consideration will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

        If any certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable and customary
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the paying agent will
pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the merger consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company
common stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to the merger agreement.

        You should not send your certificates (if any) to the paying agent until you have received transmittal materials from the paying agent.
Do not return your certificates (if any) with the enclosed proxy.

Appraisal Rights 

        Shares of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger that are held by a holder
who has made a proper demand for appraisal of such shares of Company common stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
continuously holds such shares of record from the date of the making of the demand through the effective time of the merger and has not
thereafter failed to perfect, withdraw or otherwise lose his, her or its rights to appraisal, which we refer to as dissenting shares, will not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the merger consideration in accordance with the merger agreement. Holders of dissenting
shares will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive in lieu of the merger consideration
payment in cash of the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the "fair value" of the shares of Company common stock
as of the effective time of the merger. These

rights are discussed more fully under the section of this proxy statement entitled "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 138.

        If any dissenting shares lose their status as such (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the effective time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares will be deemed to have been converted as of the effective time into the right to receive the merger
consideration in accordance with the merger agreement, without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax, and will
not thereafter be deemed to be dissenting shares.

        The Company must give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the effective
time pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice, withdrawal or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the effective time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand; and (ii) the right to participate in, direct and control
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice, withdrawal or instrument. The Company may not settle or pay or
make any payment or settlement offer prior to the effective time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument or agree to do any of
the foregoing unless Parent has given its written consent to such settlement, payment or payment or settlement offer.

Treatment of Company Stock Awards and Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

        Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, each then-outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of Company common stock with an exercise price per share equal to
or greater than the per share merger consideration will be canceled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and will have
no further force or effect. Because the current exercise price per share of each outstanding Company stock option is equal to or greater than
the merger consideration, all Company stock options will be canceled, without payment of any consideration therefor, and will have no
further force or effect.

        Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, each Company restricted stock unit that will become vested, by its terms, as a result of the closing of the merger will automatically be
canceled and converted into the right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the total number
of shares of Company common stock then underlying such Company restricted stock unit multiplied by (ii) the per share merger
consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, with such amount payable promptly after the closing of
the merger.

        Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, each Company restricted stock unit that will not be vested, by its terms, on or before the closing of the merger will automatically be
canceled and converted into the contingent right to receive from the surviving corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the
total number of shares of Company common stock then underlying such Company restricted stock unit multiplied by (ii) the per share merger
consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, with such amount payable promptly following the earlier
of (A) the date on which the original vesting conditions applicable to the underlying Company restricted stock unit, including and taking into
account any accelerated vesting provisions set forth therein, are satisfied and (B) the date that is 180 days following the closing date, provided
that the 180 day period referenced in clause (B) is extended to the earlier of the (x) the last day of the tenth month following closing and
(y) October 31, 2018 for certain Company restricted stock units granted in July 2017.

        Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, each Company performance share award that is then outstanding and unvested and that is held by a former employee of the Company
(as determined immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) will automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive
from the surviving corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the target number of shares of Company common stock subject to
such Company performance share award, as pro-rated in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company performance share award
agreement, multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, with
such amount payable promptly after the closing of the merger.

        Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, each Company performance share award that is then outstanding and unvested and that is held by a person who is an employee of the
Company immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will automatically be canceled and converted into the contingent right to
receive an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the target number of shares of Company common stock subject to such Company
performance share award multiplied by (ii) the per share merger consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable
withholding, with such amount payable promptly following the earlier of (A) the date on which the original vesting conditions applicable to
the underlying Company performance share award, including and taking into aacount any accelerated vesting provisions set forth therein, are
satisfied and (B) the date that is 180 days following the closing date, subject to the holder's continued service to the Company through the
applicable date; provided that the merger consideration payable in respect of the Company performance share awards will be paid no later
than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the closing occurs.

        The Board has suspended the Company's employee stock purchase plan indefinitely effective as of July 1, 2017. The Board will
terminate the employee stock purchase plan as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. During the period from the date of the
merger agreement until the termination of the Company's employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the merger agreement, we will not
permit any offering periods to occur.

Definition of Company Material Adverse Effect 

        Several of the representations and warranties made by the Company in the merger agreement and certain conditions to the performance
by Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations under the merger agreement are qualified by reference to whether the item in question would
have a "Company Material Adverse Effect." The merger agreement provides that a "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any effect,
change, event, occurrence or development that is materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. However, no effect, change, event, occurrence or development (by itself or when aggregated
or taken together with any and all other effects, changes, events, occurrences or developments) to the extent resulting from, arising out of,
attributable to, or related to any of the following will be deemed to be or constitute a "Company Material Adverse Effect:"

• general economic conditions (or changes in such conditions) or conditions in the global economy generally; 

• conditions (or changes in such conditions) in the securities markets, credit markets, currency markets or other financial
markets; 

• conditions (or changes in such conditions) in the industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries conduct business;

other force majeure events; 

• the announcement of the merger agreement or the pendency or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including (i) the identity of Parent and (ii) the loss or departure of officers or other employees of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries directly resulting from, arising out of, attributable to, or related to the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement; 

• the taking of any action expressly required by the merger agreement or the failure to take any action expressly prohibited by
the merger agreement; 

• changes in law or other legal or regulatory conditions (or the interpretation thereof) or changes in GAAP or other accounting
standards (or the interpretation thereof); 

• changes in the Company's stock price or the trading volume of the Company's stock, or any failure by the Company to meet
any public estimates or expectations of the Company's revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of
operations for any period, or any failure by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to meet any internal budgets, plans or
forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations (but not, in each case, the underlying
cause of such changes or failures, unless such changes or failures would otherwise be excepted from this definition); and

related to the matters described in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and eighth bullets above disproportionately adversely affect the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies that conduct business in the countries and regions in the
world and in the industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries conduct business in any material respect (in which case, such adverse
effects (if any) will be taken into account when determining whether a "Company Material Adverse Effect" has occurred or may, would or
could occur solely to the extent they are disproportionate).

Definition of Parent Material Adverse Effect 

        Certain of the representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in the merger agreement and certain conditions to the
performance of the Company's obligations under the merger agreement are qualified by reference to whether the item in question would have
a "Parent Material Adverse Effect." The merger agreement provides that a "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means any change, event or

the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or otherwise perform any of its obligations under the

• enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or provide access to any
non-public information to any person who has made or would reasonably be expected to make, any acquisition proposal or
otherwise for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any acquisition proposal.

        However, subject to compliance with the merger agreement, at any time prior to receipt of the Company stockholder approval the
Company may, if the Board determines that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties:

• furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries to any person who has made an acquisition
proposal that did not result from a material breach of the merger agreement that the Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a superior proposal,
which we refer to as a qualified person, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement not materially less restrictive in any
substantive manner, including with respect to standstill provisions, than the confidentiality agreement between the Company
and Sycamore (and which confidentiality agreement may not include an obligation of the Company to reimburse such person's
expenses); 

• engage in discussions or negotiations (including solicitation of revised acquisition proposals) with any qualified person
regarding any acquisition proposal; or 

• amend, or grant a waiver or release under, any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any Company common stock
with any qualified person solely to allow for an acquisition proposal to be made in a confidential manner to the Company or
the Board.

        An "acquisition proposal" means any written:

• proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization, share exchange, tender offer or other business
combination involving the Company and its subsidiaries (other than (i) mergers, consolidations, recapitalizations, share
exchanges or other business combinations involving solely the Company and/or one or more subsidiaries of the Company and
(ii) mergers, consolidations, recapitalizations, share exchanges, tender offers or other business combinations that if
consummated would result in the holders of the outstanding shares of Company common stock immediately prior to such
transaction owning more than 80% of the equity securities of the Company, or any successor or acquiring entity, immediately
thereafter); 

• proposal for the direct or indirect disposition, sale or issuance by the Company of 20% or more of any class of its equity
securities; or 

• proposal or offer to acquire, combine, license, reorganize or subject to a joint venture, in any manner, directly or indirectly,
20% or more of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries;

in each case other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any offer or proposal by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent.

        A "superior proposal" means any bona fide acquisition proposal made by a third party after the date of the merger agreement to acquire,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, (i) on terms
which the Board determines in its good faith judgment to be more favorable to the holders of Company common stock than the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement (after consultation with its financial and legal advisors), taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal (including financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal) and the merger agreement (including
any written, binding offer by Parent to amend the terms of the merger agreement) that the Board determines to be relevant and (ii) which the
Board determines to be reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such proposal that the

Board determines to be relevant. In no event will an acquisition proposal be considered a "superior proposal" if it was solicited, initiated,
facilitated, encouraged or negotiated in material breach of the merger agreement by the Company.

        The Company must, within one business day, advise Parent orally and in writing of the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' or any of
their respective representatives' receipt of any acquisition proposal or request for material non-public information or access to the Company or
its representatives by any third party that the Company reasonably believes is related to an acquisition proposal or potential acquisition
proposal, including the material terms and conditions of any such request for information or access or acquisition proposal and the identity of
the person making any such acquisition proposal. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis of any
material developments with respect to any such request for information or access or acquisition proposal, including with respect to the terms
and status thereof and whether any such acquisition proposal has been withdrawn or rejected and must provide Parent written notice of any
such withdrawal or rejection and copies of any written request for information or access or acquisition proposal within 48 hours. Neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries will enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date of the merger agreement which
prohibits the Company from providing to Parent the information or access required to be provided to Parent pursuant to this provision of the
merger agreement.

        Under the merger agreement, the Company agreed to, and agreed to cause its subsidiaries to, and agreed to direct their respective
representatives to, except with respect to Parent and Merger Sub:

• cease immediately all solicitations, discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the date of the merger agreement
regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal; 

• request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential or non-public information or access previously furnished to any
person within the last twelve months of the date of the merger agreement for the purpose of evaluating a possible acquisition
proposal; and 

• terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a possible acquisition proposal.

Restrictions on Changes of Recommendation to Company Stockholders 

        Under the merger agreement, the Board must submit the merger agreement to the Company's stockholders for adoption and must
recommend that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement. Prior to the earlier of the effective time of the
merger and the termination of the merger agreement:

• the Board may not (we refer to each of the actions listed in the following five sub-bullets as a Company board
recommendation change): 

• withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw or modify, in each case in a manner adverse
to Parent, its recommendation to the Company's stockholders that the Company's stockholders adopt the merger
agreement at the special meeting, which we refer to as the recommendation; 

• fail to include the recommendation in this proxy statement; 

• fail to publicly reaffirm the recommendation within five business days of a request therefor in writing by Parent
following the public disclosure of an acquisition proposal with any person other than Parent and Merger Sub;

Table of Contents

• fail to recommend against any acquisition proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer within ten business days
after the commencement thereof; or 

• publicly announce an intention or resolution to effect any of the foregoing; 

• the Company and its subsidiaries may not enter into, or publicly authorize or agree to enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement
relating to any acquisition proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in the circumstances described above
in the section entitled "—Restrictions on Solicitations of Other Offers"); or 

• the Board may not adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, any
acquisition proposal.

        However, prior to receipt of the Company stockholder approval, the Board may, (i) in response to a superior proposal that did not result
from a material breach of the merger agreement, either effect a Company board recommendation change or cause the Company to terminate
the merger agreement, provided that concurrently with or prior to such termination, the Company pays to Parent the company termination fee
as required by the merger agreement and, immediately after the termination of the merger agreement, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement providing for such superior proposal, or (ii) in response to an intervening event, effect a Company board recommendation change
if, and only if, (in the case of either (i) or (ii)):

• the Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to effect a Company board
recommendation change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; 

• the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect a Company board recommendation change or termination
of the merger agreement, describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such intended Company board recommendation
change or termination, which we refer to as a recommendation change notice; 

• if requested by Parent, the Company will have made itself and its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives
available and the Company will have and will have caused its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to
discuss and negotiate with Parent's representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of the merger
agreement (in a manner that would obviate the need to effect such Company board recommendation change) during the four
business day period following delivery by the Company to Parent of such recommendation change notice (it being understood
that if there are any material amendments, revisions or changes to the terms of any such superior proposal (including any
revision to the amount, form or mix of consideration the Company's stockholders would receive as a result of the superior
proposal, whether or not material), the Company will notify Parent of each such amendment, revision or change and the
applicable four business day period described above will be extended for at least two business days from the date of such
notice), which we refer to as a notice period; and 

• at the end of such notice period, the Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel), after
considering any modified terms and conditions proposed by or on behalf of Parent, that the failure to effect a Company board
recommendation change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and, with
respect to a Company board recommendation change in response to a superior proposal, the Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such initial or revised (as applicable) superior
proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal.

Table of Contents

        Nothing contained in the merger agreement prohibits the Company or the Board from:

• taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder (none of which, in and of itself, will be deemed to constitute a Company board recommendation change); or 

• making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board, after consultation with
outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law.

        However, in no event may the Board make a Company board recommendation change except to the extent expressly permitted by, and in
accordance with, the provisions of the merger agreement described above.

Additional Agreements of the Parties to the Merger Agreement 

Listing of Company Common Stock 

        Until the effective time, the Company must use its commercially reasonable efforts to continue the listing of Company common stock on
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Access to Information 

        Until the earlier to occur of the effective time of the merger and the termination of the merger agreement, the Company and its
subsidiaries will afford to Parent and Parent's representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in
a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with business operations, to all of its properties, books, contracts and records as
Parent may reasonably request, and, during such period, the Company and its subsidiaries will promptly make available to Parent (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities laws and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and assets as Parent may reasonably request,
except for certain exceptions. Prior to the closing of the merger, neither Parent nor Merger Sub will (and each will cause its affiliates and
representatives not to) contact or communicate with any of the employees, customers, licensors or suppliers of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of the Company.

Legal Conditions to the Merger 

        Parent and the Company must each use its reasonable best efforts to:

• take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties to the
merger agreement in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement as promptly as practicable; 

• as promptly as practicable, obtain any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be
obtained by such party (or any of its subsidiaries) from any governmental entity or third party in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby, except that in no event will Parent or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries be required to pay any
monies (except for filings or similar fees) or (except, in the case of Parent or its subsidiaries, as described below) agree to any
material undertaking in connection with any of the foregoing;

Table of Contents

• as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to the
merger agreement and the merger required under (i) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities
laws, (ii) the HSR Act, and any related governmental request thereunder and (iii) any other applicable law; 

• contest and resist any action, including any administrative or judicial action, and seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent), which we refer to
as a restrictive order, which has the effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the merger
or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and 

• execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out
the purposes of, the merger agreement.

        Parent must propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or, effective as of the effective time of the
merger, the surviving corporation, or their respective subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which it is
capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability
to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of Parent, the surviving corporation or their respective subsidiaries, in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any restrictive order, which would have the effect of preventing or delaying the closing beyond the
outside date, provided that Parent will not be obligated to take any such action unless the taking of such action is expressly conditioned upon
the consummation of the merger.

Public Disclosure 

        Except as may be required by law or stock market regulations, Parent and the Company must mutually agree upon the form and
substance of:

• any widespread internal written communications that may be made by the Company to its officers, employees, independent
contractors, consultants, directors, suppliers, customers, contract counterparties and/or other business relations of the
Company or its subsidiaries with respect to the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby;
and/or 

• any other press release or other public statement with respect to the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby.

        In addition, the Company must use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with Parent prior to making any widespread internal
oral communications to its employees.

Indemnification 

        For six years following the effective time of the merger, Parent and the Company have agreed that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of the merger agreement, or
who becomes prior to the effective time of the merger, an officer, director or manager of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, who we refer
to as an indemnified party, whether provided in the organizational documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or in any
indemnification agreement between any indemnified party and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, will survive the merger and continue in
full force and effect, and may not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder
of any indemnified party.

Table of Contents

        For six years following the effective time of the merger, Parent and the surviving corporation have agreed to maintain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the
Company and its subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time of the
merger as contained in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company in effect on the date of the merger agreement.

        Parent has also agreed to either:

• maintain in effect for six years from the effective time of the merger the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger (including the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement), so long as the annual premiums would not exceed more than 300% of the
current annual premium paid for the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, which we refer to as the
Maximum Premium; or 

• purchase a "tail" policy for an annual cost not to exceed the Maximum Premium and maintain such "tail" policy in full force
and effect for six years from the effective time of the merger.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, prior to the effective time of the merger, elect to purchase its own "tail" policy using a
nationally recognized broker selected by Parent in consultation with the Company, as long as such "tail" policy does not cost more than the
Maximum Premium.

        In the event Parent or the surviving corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and will not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the surviving corporation, as the case may be, will assume and succeed to the obligations described above.

        If any indemnified party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under these provisions of the merger
agreement that is denied by Parent and/or the Company or the surviving corporation, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
indemnified party is entitled to such indemnification or advancement of expenses, then Parent, the Company or the surviving corporation will
pay the indemnified party's costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred by the indemnified party in connection
with pursuing his or her claims to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Notification of Certain Matters 

        Prior to the effective time, Parent must give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company must give prompt notice to Parent, of:

• the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such party contained in the merger agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any manner that
would result in the failure of a closing condition; 

• any material breach by such person of any covenant or agreement set forth in the merger agreement; 

• any written notice or other written communication from any governmental entity or counterparty to certain material contracts
alleging that the consent of such governmental entity or such counterparty, as applicable, is required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; or

Table of Contents

• any actions, suits claims or proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened in writing against such person or any of
its subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Employee Benefits Matters 

        For a period of one year following the effective time (or, if shorter, the period of employment of the relevant Company employee),
Parent must provide, or must cause to be provided, (i) to each Company employee a total compensation package no less favorable in the
aggregate than the total compensation package (including base salary or wage rates, commissions and target annual cash bonus opportunities
but excluding the value of annual equity awards and cash payments in lieu of equity awards) provided to such Company employee
immediately before the effective time and (ii) to all Company employees in the aggregate other employee benefits (other than the Company
employee stock purchase plan, long-term incentive or defined benefit pension or equity awards or cash payments in lieu thereof) that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other benefits provided to such Company employees immediately before the effective time.

        For purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate (but not for accrual or level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company employees after the effective time, each Company employee must, subject to
applicable law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the effective time, to the same extent as such Company employee was entitled, before the
effective time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee plan in which such Company employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the effective time, except that the foregoing will not apply to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits.

        If any Company employee (who is not otherwise a party to an employment agreement, offer letter or similar agreement or arrangement
or any amendment or supplement of any of the foregoing, in each case that provides for a different treatment with respect to severance) whose
employment is terminated on or prior to the first anniversary of the effective time under circumstances under which such Company employee
would have received severance benefits under the Company severance policy, Parent will cause the surviving corporation to provide that such
Company employee will be entitled to severance benefits from the surviving corporation that are no less favorable than the severance benefits
that would have been granted under the Company severance policy as in existence on the date of the merger agreement and will notify such
Company employee of such benefits in a manner consistent with the Company's past practices prior to the date of the merger agreement.

        From and after the effective time, Parent must cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to assume, in accordance with their
terms, all obligations of the Company under contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the Company and the
subsidiaries of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof and in the form provided to Parent prior to the date hereof that
are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, including any employment,
severance, and termination plans and agreements.

Table of Contents

        All provisions contained in the merger agreement with respect to employee benefit plans or employee compensation are included for the
sole benefit of the respective parties and shall not create any right (including any third party beneficiary rights) in any other person, including
any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any participant or beneficiary in any Company employee plan.
Nothing in the merger agreement (i) will require Parent, the surviving corporation or any of their subsidiaries to continue to employ any
particular Company employee following the effective time or to provide any right to a particular term or condition of employment, (ii) will,
for a period of one year following the effective time, permit the reduction of the existing severance or acceleration benefits in effect on the
date of the merger agreement for any Company employee, or (iii) except as provided in the foregoing clause (ii), will be construed to prohibit
Parent, the surviving corporation or any of their subsidiaries from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan in accordance with its
terms or to amend or create any employee benefit plan or any similar plan or agreement from Parent or its affiliates.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing (other than potentially with respect to severance), employees located outside the United States or covered
by collective bargaining agreements will be treated instead in accordance with applicable contracts (after taking into account the assumptions
of contracts described above) and applicable law.

State Takeover Laws 

        The Company and the Board must not take any action that would cause any anti-takeover or other similar law to become applicable to
restrict or prohibit the merger or any other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. If any "fair price," "business combination" or
"control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation is or may become applicable to any of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, the parties to the merger agreement must use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated under the merger agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated under the merger agreement and (ii) otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or, if
unable to be eliminated, minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on such transactions.

Rule 16b-3 

        Prior to the effective time of the merger, the Company must take all reasonable steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company and who would otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to be
exempt under under such rule to the extent permitted by applicable law.

Financing 

        Each of Parent and Merger Sub must use, and must cause their respective affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the financing pursuant to
the debt commitment letter, which we refer to as the debt financing, and the financing pursuant to the equity commitment letters, which we
refer to as the equity financing, on the terms and subject only to the conditions set forth in the debt commitment letter and the equity
commitment letters. We refer to the debt financing together with the equity financing as the financing. We refer to the debt commitment letter

of Parent and Merger Sub mentioned in the first sentence of this paragraph include reasonable best efforts to:

• maintain in effect and comply with the financing letters; 

• negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the debt financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions
set forth in the debt commitment letter; 

• satisfy (and cause its affiliates to satisfy) on a timely (taking into account the marketing period) basis all conditions applicable
to Parent and its affiliates in the financing letters and the definitive agreements related thereto (or, if necessary or deemed
advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub contained in such financing letter or
such definitive agreements related thereto); 

• consummate the financing at or prior to the closing date; 

• enforce its rights under the financing letters and the definitive agreements relating to the financing; and 

• comply with its covenants and other obligations under the financing letters and the definitive agreements relating to the
financing.

        Parent must not, and must not permit any of its affiliates to, take any action not otherwise required under the merger agreement that is a
breach of, or would result in termination of, any of the financing letters. Parent, Merger Sub and the guarantors must not, without the prior
written consent of the Company, agree to or permit any termination of or amendment, supplement or modification to be made to, or grant any
waiver of any provision under, the financing letters or the definitive agreements relating to the financing if such termination, amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver would be reasonably likely to (we refer to amendments described in the three following bullets as
prohibited amendments):

• (i) reduce (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of any portion of the debt financing unless an alternative
source of the equity financing or other financing is increased by a corresponding amount or (ii) reduce the amount of equity
financing unless the debt financing or alternative financing is increased by a corresponding amount, so long as in the case of
clauses (i) and (ii), the terms of such financing would not constitute a prohibited amendment under the two bullets
immediately below; 

• adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the financing
letters or the definitive agreements with respect to the financing; or 

• impose new or additional conditions precedent to the availability of the financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any
of the conditions precedent to the financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any other provision of the financing letters
in a manner that could reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent or make less likely to occur the funding of the
financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the financing) on the closing date.

        Parent must keep the Company informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail, upon reasonable request by the Company, of the
status of its efforts to arrange the debt financing and provide to the Company drafts (reasonably in advance of execution) and thereafter

repudiation by any party to any of the financing letters or definitive documents related to the financing of which Parent or
Merger Sub becomes aware;

• of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any financing source with respect to any (i) actual or
potential breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to any of the financing letters or any definitive
document related to the financing of any provisions of the financing letters or any definitive document related to the financing
or (ii) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any of the financing letters or any definitive
document related to the financing with respect to the conditionality or amount of the financing or the obligation to fund the
financing or the amount of the financing to be funded at the closing (but excluding ordinary course negotiations); and 

• of the occurrence of an event or development that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of the financing contemplated by the financing letters in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two business days of the date the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a
written request, Parent and Merger Sub must provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in the three bullets immediately above. If any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any applicable market flex provisions) contemplated by the debt commitment letter and alternative financing (so long as the terms
thereof are of the type that would not constitute a prohibited amendment, as described above) or an increase in the equity financing is not then
made available in an amount equal to such portion, and such portion is required to fund the aggregate merger consideration and all fees,
expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent pursuant to the merger agreement, Parent must promptly notify the Company
in writing and Parent and Merger Sub must use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof, and negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement with terms and conditions (including market flex provisions) not materially less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and Merger Sub (or their respective affiliates) than the terms and conditions set forth in the debt
commitment letter, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the final day of the marketing period.
In no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require Parent to (i) pay fees materially in excess of those
contained in the debt commitment letter (including the market flex provisions) or agree to market flex terms materially less favorable to
Parent than the corresponding market flex terms contained in or contemplated by the debt commitment letter or (ii) enter into any alternative
financing the terms of which are materially less favorable to Parent than those contained in the debt commitment letter on the date of the
merger agreement (taken as a whole).

        In the event that (i) any portion of the debt financing anticipated under the debt commitment letter to be structured as a high yield bond
financing is unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, and such amount is not funded through a securities demand under the debt
commitment letter, (ii) all closing conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub have been satisfied or waived (other than any such
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the closing, and
those conditions the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable to a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement) and (iii) a bridge facility contemplated by the debt commitment letter (or an
alternative bridge facility or other financing obtained in accordance with the merger agreement) is available on the terms described in the debt
commitment letter, then Parent and Merger Sub must cause the applicable financing sources to fund such bridge financing in accordance

with the terms of the debt commitment letter and the proceeds shall be used in lieu of the affected portion of the high yield bond financing.

        Prior to the closing date, the Company must use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause its subsidiaries to provide, to Parent
and Merger Sub, in each case at Parent's sole cost and expense, such reasonable cooperation as is customary and reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the arrangement, syndication and consummation of the debt financing, including using its reasonable best efforts to:

• furnish Parent and Merger Sub and their debt financing sources, as promptly as reasonably practicable, all required financial
information (as described above in the section entitled "—Marketing Period"); 

• have the Company designate members of its senior management to execute customary authorization letters with respect to
Company information included in a customary confidential information memorandum for a syndicated bank financing and
cause management of the Company to participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, sessions
(upon reasonable request) with rating agencies, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions between senior
management and the sources of the debt financing; 

• provide reasonable and customary assistance with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, road shows,
bank information memoranda, private placement memoranda and other customary marketing materials and provide reasonable
cooperation with the due diligence efforts of the debt financing sources to the extent reasonable and customary; 

• request the Company's independent auditors to cooperate with Parent to obtain an agreed upon form of comfort letter; 

• to the extent timely requested by Parent and required under the debt commitment letter, (i) obtain documents reasonably
requested by Parent or its debt financing sources relating to the repayment of the existing indebtedness of the Company and its
subsidiaries and the release of related liens and related guarantees and (ii) provide all documentation and other information
required by U.S. bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each case as reasonably requested by Parent at least ten
business days prior to the closing date; 

• assist in the preparation, execution and delivery of definitive financing documents, including guarantee and collateral
documents and customary closing certificates (including a solvency certificate from the chief financial officer or other officer
of equivalent duties) as may be required by the debt financing and other customary documents as may be reasonably requested
by Parent and cooperate to facilitate the pledging of, granting of security interests in and obtaining perfection of any liens on,
collateral in connection with the debt financing, but in no event shall any of the foregoing be effective until as of or after the
closing; 

• cooperate with Parent and take all corporate actions or other similar actions reasonably necessary to permit the consummation
of the financing, including customary resolutions, consents or approvals; 

• assist Parent in obtaining legal opinions from local outside counsel as reasonably requested by Parent for financings similar to
the financing; 

• (i) subject to confidentiality restrictions, permit the prospective lenders involved in the financing to evaluate the Company and
its subsidiaries' current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the
purpose of establishing collateral arrangements, (ii) cooperate with Parent to establish bank and other accounts and blocked

account agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing and (iii) permit representatives of the
prospective lenders to conduct commercial field examinations, inventory and intellectual property appraisals, environmental
assessments and an appraisal of the owned real property, and make audits and appraisals delivered for the purposes of any
credit facility available to Parent for purposes of its financing;

• provide monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) of the Company and its subsidiaries or business units to the extent
the Company customarily prepares (and has prepared) such financial statements; and 

• use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in benefiting from the existing lending relationships of the Company and
its subsidiaries.

        The requested cooperation described above must not, in the Company's reasonable judgment, unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
business or operations of the Company and any of its subsidiaries. In no event will the Company or any of its subsidiaries be required to bear
any cost or expense, pay any commitment or other fee, enter into any definitive agreement, incur any other liability or obligation, make any
other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the financing or any of the foregoing prior to the effective time. In
addition, none of the requested cooperation described above will require any action that would conflict with or violate the Company's or any
of its subsidiaries' organizational documents or any laws or result in, prior to the effective time, the contravention of, or that would reasonably
be expected to result in, prior to the effective time, a violation or breach of, or default under, any contract to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party. In addition, if, in connection with a marketing effort contemplated by the debt commitment letter, Parent reasonably
requests the Company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains material non-public information with
respect to the Company, which Parent reasonably desires to include in a customary offering memorandum for the debt financing, then the
Company must discuss in good faith whether or not the Company will file a Current Report on Form 8-K or similar document containing such
material non-public information.

        None of the Company or its subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors (with respect to any subsidiary of the Company) or
employees will be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the financing contemplated by the financing
letters that is not contingent upon the closing or that would be effective prior to the closing and no directors of the Company that will not be
continuing directors, acting in such capacity, will be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement, or to pass any resolutions or
consents, with respect to the financing, except for any customary authorization letters. Parent must promptly, upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and fees and expenses of the
Company's accounting firms engaged to assist in connection with the financing) incurred by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of
their respective representatives in connection with the financing, and must indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its subsidiaries and
their respective representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement of the financing and any information used in connection therewith.

        Parent must, and must cause its affiliates to, refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that could reasonably be expected to
result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in the financing letters or in any definitive agreement relating to the financing. Parent
and Merger Sub have acknowledged and agreed under the merger agreement that, notwithstanding the Company's obligations under the
merger agreement, none of the obtaining of the financing or any permitted alternative financing, the completion of any issuance of securities
contemplated by the financing, or the Company or any of its subsidiaries having or maintaining any available cash balances is a condition to
the closing, and have reaffirmed their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger

agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the financing or any permitted alternative financing, the completion of any
such issuance, or the Company or any of its subsidiaries having or maintaining any available cash balances.

Security Holder Litigation 

        In the event that any litigation related to the merger agreement, the merger or the other transactions contemplated thereby is brought by
any stockholder of the Company or any holder of the Company's other securities against the Company and/or its directors or officers, the
Company must promptly notify Parent of such litigation and must keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The
Company will have the right to control the defense and settlement of any litigation related to the merger agreement, the merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement brought by any stockholder of the Company or any holder of the Company's other
securities against the Company and/or its directors or officers. However, the Company will give Parent the opportunity to participate, at
Parent's expense, in the defense of any such litigation and the Company must consider in good faith Parent's advice with respect to such
litigation. The Company may not settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of Parent.

Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders' Meeting 

        As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Company's receipt of notice from the SEC that the SEC has completed its review of
this proxy statement (or, if the SEC does not inform the Company that it intends to review this proxy statement on or before the 10th calendar
day following the filing of this proxy statement, as promptly as reasonably practicable following such 10th calendar day), the Company is
obligated to call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders, which we refer to as the special meeting, to consider
adoption of the merger agreement and the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act.

        However, the Board is permitted to adjourn, delay or postpone the special meeting in accordance with applicable law (but not beyond the
outside date, which is described below)

• to the extent necessary to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is reasonably likely to be
necessary or appropriate under applicable law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by the Company's stockholders prior to the special meeting; 

• if there are insufficient shares of Company common stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the special meeting; or 

• on one occasion to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent the Board or any committee
thereof reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the Company stockholder approval.

        Except to the extent that the Board will have effected a Company board recommendation change in accordance with the merger
agreement, the Board must (i) recommend to its stockholders that they adopt the merger agreement and (ii) include such recommendation in
this proxy statement.

Carveout Transaction Matters 

        If requested by Parent, at Parent's sole expense, the Company must:

• provide commercially reasonable cooperation to Parent and Merger Sub's review of and planning for an internal reorganization
of the Company and its subsidiaries into separate internal

Table of Contents

organizations for the United States retail, Canadian retail, and North American delivery businesses, which we refer to as the
carveout transactions; and

• refrain from taking actions to effect any internal reorganization to implement the carveout transactions without the prior
written consent of Parent.

        However, the Company is not required to take any corporate action, to execute any document or other instrument, or to incur any liability
that is not conditioned upon or that would be effective prior to the effective time of the merger. The completion of the carveout transactions is
not a condition to closing and the Company's compliance or failure to comply with its obligations to cooperate with the carveout transactions
will not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the closing condition regarding the Company's compliance with its
covenants has been satisfied.

Repatriation 

        The merger agreement provides that we and our wholly-owned subsidiaries will cooperate with Parent to effect the transfer of
unrestricted cash balances held in commercial bank accounts in foreign jurisdictions to accounts located in the United States, in each case
effective as of the effective time. Parent has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its subsidiaries and its and their
representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments, taxes and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with any such repatriation. The repatriation of foreign cash is not a condition to closing
and the Company's compliance or failure to comply with its obligations to cooperate with the repatriation of foreign cash will not be taken
into account for purposes of determining whether the closing condition regarding the Company's compliance with its covenants has been
satisfied.

Treatment of Certain Notes 

        The Company has previously issued 2.750% Senior Notes Due 2018, which we refer to as the 2018 Notes, and 4.375% Senior Notes Due
2023, which we refer to as the 2023 Notes. We refer to the 2018 Notes and the 2023 Notes together as the Notes.

        The Company has agreed, at the request and expense of Parent, to promptly commence an offer to purchase for any and all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes on price terms that are acceptable to Parent and such other customary terms and
conditions as are reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent to be consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of the
merger using funds provided by Parent, which we refer to as a Debt Tender Offer. Any Debt Tender Offer will be conditioned on the closing
of the merger. On July 31, 2017, the Company announced that it had commenced a Debt Tender Offer for the 2023 Notes.

        If reasonably requested by Parent in writing, the Company will, in accordance with the applicable redemption provisions of the
applicable series of Notes and the indenture governing such Notes, (i) substantially simultaneous with the effective time issue a notice of
optional redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes, pursuant to the redemption provisions of the
applicable indenture and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to take any other actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the satisfaction
and discharge of such series of Notes pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge provisions of the applicable indenture and the other provisions
of such indenture applicable thereto, in each case so long as Parent has or has caused to be set aside sufficient and immediately available
funds to deliver to the Company to effect such redemption and satisfaction and discharge.

        Parent will (or the Company will, if directed by Parent), at a time selected by Parent at or after the closing of the merger, commence a
change of control offer to purchase all of the 2023 Notes (in accordance with the requirements of the indenture governing such Notes) at the
price required

pursuant to the indenture governing such Notes using funds provided by Parent. In accordance with the terms of the change of control offer
for the 2023 Notes, the surviving corporation will accept for purchase and purchase each of the 2023 Notes properly tendered and not
properly withdrawn in such change of control offer using funds provided by Parent.

        The Company and its subsidiaries will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable law
to the extent such laws are applicable in connection with the any change of control offer or any Debt Tender Offer and such compliance will
not be deemed a breach of the merger agreement.

        Parent will promptly, upon the Company's request, reimburse the Company for certain reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs,
fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company at the request of Parent in connection with its compliance with the obligations
under the Notes, including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company in
connection with any Debt Tender Offer, redemption, satisfaction, discharge or change of control offer made in respect of any series of Notes
(including any out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation or distribution of any offer documents or
other documents related thereto). Subject to certain exceptions, Parent will also indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
representatives for certain liabilities incurred by any of them in connection with any such action.

Conditions to the Merger 

        The obligation of each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
following conditions:

• the obtaining of the Company stockholder approval; 

• the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act having
expired or early termination thereof having been granted; and 

• no governmental entity of competent jurisdiction having enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any order,
executive order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction (temporary, preliminary or permanent) or statute, rule or regulation which
is in effect and which has the effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting, restraining, preventing or enjoining
consummation of the merger.

        The obligation of the Company to consummate the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following additional conditions:

• the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub that (i) are not made as of a specific date being true and correct as
of the effective time, as though made as of the effective time, and (ii) are made as of a specific date being true and correct as of
such date, in each case, except where the failure of such representations or warranties to be true and correct (without giving
effect to any limitation as to materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect set forth in such representations and warranties) is
not reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; 

• each of Parent and Merger Sub having performed in all material respects all covenants and obligations required to be
performed by it under the merger agreement at or prior to the effective time; and 

• receipt of a certificate, dated as of the closing date, signed by an executive officer of Parent certifying as to the matters set
forth in the immediately preceding two bullets.

        The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following additional
conditions:

• the Company's representation regarding the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect being true and correct in all
respects as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the effective time, as though made as of the effective time;

respects as of the date of the merger agreement and the effective time, as though made as of the effective time (other than any
such representation or warranty that is made as of a specific date, which need only be true and correct in all respects as of such
date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to result in more than $5,000,000 of aggregate merger consideration or amounts payable to
holders of equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement; 

• certain representations and warranties of the Company regarding organization, capitalization, authority, Section 203 of the
DGCL and brokers being true and correct in all material respects (other than any such representation or warranty that is

time, as though made on and as of the date hereof and the effective time (other than any such representation or warranty that is
made as of a specific date, which need only be true and correct in all material respects as of such date);

effective time, as though made as of the effective time (other than any such representation or warranty that is made as of a
specific date, which need only be true and correct as of such date), except where the failure of such representations or
warranties to be true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
set forth in such representations and warranties) is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

the merger agreement prior to the effective time; and 

• receipt of a certificate, dated as of the closing date, signed by an executive officer of the Company certifying as to the matters

Termination 

        The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned:

• by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to the effective time; 

• by either Parent or the Company, if the effective time of the merger has not occurred on or before December 22, 2017, which
we refer to as the outside date, except that a party to the merger agreement will not be permitted to terminate the merger
agreement under this provision if the failure of such party to fulfill, in any material respect, any obligation under the merger
agreement has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the effective time to occur on or before the outside date,
provided that no party will be permitted to terminate the merger agreement during the three business day notice period
referenced in the final bullet in this section entitled "—Termination;" 

• by either Parent or the Company at any time prior to the effective time if a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has
issued a nonappealable final order, decree, judgment, injunction or ruling or taken any other nonappealable final action, in
each case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining, preventing or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
merger, except that a party to the merger agreement will not be permitted to terminate the merger agreement under this
provision if the failure of such party to use the standard of efforts required pursuant to the merger agreement to prevent and
oppose such order, decree, ruling or the taking of such other action has been a principal cause of or resulted in the issuance of
any such order, decree, ruling or the taking of such other action;

and survive any valid termination of the merger agreement in accordance with their respective terms and conditions.

        A "willful breach" means a material breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in the merger agreement that is a consequence of an
act, or failure to act, undertaken by the breaching party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act, or failure to act, would result, or
would reasonably be expected to result, in such breach.

Termination Fees 

        Subject to certain limitations, the Company will pay Parent a termination fee equal to $171,000,000, which we refer to as the Company
termination fee, in the event that the merger agreement is terminated:

• by Parent if the Board has effected a Company board recommendation change; 

• by the Company in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal; or 

• (i) by Parent if there has been a breach of, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Company set forth in the merger agreement, which breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform would cause
certain closing conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub set forth in the merger agreement not to be satisfied, and is not
capable of being cured by the outside date or, if capable of being cured by the outside date, will not have been cured within 20
business days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform from
Parent, (ii) by either Parent or the Company, prior to receipt of the Company stockholder approval, if the effective time of the
merger has not occurred on or before the outside date or (iii) by Parent or the Company if the Company stockholder approval
is not obtained, if (in each of the preceding clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)): 

• before the date of such termination, an acquisition proposal has been publicly announced, made or disclosed and not
irrevocably withdrawn without encouragement by or consultation with (excluding arms-length negotiations regarding
the terms of the acquisition proposal) the Company or its representatives; 

• at the time of the stockholder vote, the debt and equity commitment letters are in full force and effect or have been
replaced by alternative financing commitments in corresponding amounts sufficient to consummate the merger; and 

• within 12 months after the date of termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any
acquisition proposal (which is subsequently consummated) or has consummated any acquisition proposal (provided
that, for these purposes, the references to "20%" and "80%" in the definition of "acquisition proposal" are deemed to
be references to "50%").

        If either the Company or Parent terminates the merger agreement because the Company stockholder approval is not obtained and at the
time of the stockholder vote, the debt and equity commitment letters are in full force and effect or have been replaced with letters providing
for alternative financing commitments in a corresponding amount sufficient to consummate the merger, the Company will pay to Parent
within two business days following the delivery by Parent of an invoice therefor any and all out-of-pocket fees and expenses actually incurred
by Parent or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, investigation, negotiation, execution and performance
of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, which we refer to as the Parent expenses, up to a
maximum amount of $15,000,000. To the extent a Company termination fee becomes payable, any payment previously made pursuant to the
preceding sentence will be credited against the obligation of the Company to pay the Company termination fee.

        Subject to certain limitations, Parent will pay the Company a termination fee equal to $343,000,000 in the event that the merger
agreement is terminated:

• by the Company, prior to the effective time, if there has been a breach of, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in the merger agreement, which breach,
inaccuracy or failure to perform (i) would cause certain closing conditions applicable to the Company set forth in the merger
agreement not to be satisfied, and (ii) is not capable of being cured by the outside date or, if capable of being cured by the
outside date, will not have been cured within 20 business days following receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach,
inaccuracy or failure to perform from the Company; or 

• by the Company if: 

• the marketing period has ended and the closing conditions applicable to Parent (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the closing each of which is capable of being satisfied at the closing)
have been and continue to be satisfied; 

• the Company has confirmed by written notice to Parent after the end of the marketing period that all closing conditions
applicable to the Company have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the closing each of which is capable of being satisfied at the closing) or that it irrevocably waives in
writing any unsatisfied conditions that may be waived under applicable law; and 

• the merger has not been consummated within three business days after the date on which Parent is required to
consummate the merger pursuant to the merger agreement, and at all times during such three business day period, the
Company stood ready, willing and able to consummate the merger.

        In no event will the Company or Parent be required to pay a termination fee on more than one occasion.

        If the Company or Parent fails to timely pay any amount described above and, in order to obtain the payment, the other party commences
a suit, action or proceeding which results in a final and non-appealable judgment against the other party for the applicable payment set forth
above, such paying party will pay the other party its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, action or proceeding, together with interest on such amount at the
prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment
was actually received.

        Payment of the Parent termination fee to the Company, together with any indemnification for or reimbursement of any applicable
expenses pursuant to certain provisions of the merger agreement, will

or their affiliates' respective direct or indirect, former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, equityholders,

breach) or failure to perform under the merger agreement, the financing letters or the limited guarantee, any of the transactions (or the
abandonment or termination thereof), the failure of the merger or the other transactions to be consummated or any matters forming the basis
for such termination.

        Payment of the Company termination fee to Parent shall, together with any reimbursement of applicable expenses, be the sole and
exclusive remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, the Parent related parties or any other person
arising out of or in connection with the merger agreement, the transactions (and the abandonment or termination thereof), any breach
(including any willful breach) or failure to perform under the merger agreement, the failure of the merger or the other transactions to be

subsidiaries and any of their respective direct or indirect, former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers,

the benefit of the Company, which we refer to collectively as the Company related parties, arising out of or in connection with the merger
agreement (including any willful breach), any of the transactions, the failure of the merger or the other transactions to be consummated or any
matters forming the basis for such termination.

Amendment; Extension; Waiver; Procedures 

Amendment 

        The merger agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented by the parties to the merger agreement by action taken or authorized
by their respective boards of directors at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before or after receipt of the Company
stockholder approval, except that after receipt of the Company stockholder approval, no amendment may be made that pursuant to applicable
law requires further approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company without such further approval or adoption. The merger
agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an
instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment, modification or supplement to the merger agreement (as applicable), signed
on behalf of each of the parties to the merger agreement.

Extension; Waiver 

        At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, the parties to the merger agreement, by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties to the merger agreement, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in

the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant the merger agreement and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in the merger agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to the merger agreement to any such extension or waiver
will be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver will not apply to any time for
performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than
that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to the merger agreement to assert any of its rights under the merger
agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver 

        A termination, amendment, modification, supplement, extension or waiver of the merger agreement will, in order to be effective, require
action by the respective board of directors of the applicable parties.

Remedies 

        Under the merger agreement, the parties thereto have acknowledged and agreed that the parties will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of the merger agreement. The right of the Company to obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies
in connection with enforcing Parent's obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable equity commitment letter and to effect the closing is subject in all events to the requirements that:

• the marketing period has ended and the satisfaction, or express written waiver by Parent of all conditions precedent to the
obligations of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to such conditions being satisfied at the closing) at the time when
the closing would have been required to occur pursuant to the merger agreement, but for the failure of the equity financing to
be funded; 

• the debt financing has been funded or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the closing if the equity financing
is or were to be funded at the closing; and 

• the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the equity financing
and debt financing were funded, then it would take such actions required of it by the merger agreement to cause the closing to
occur and it stands ready, willing and able to consummate the merger.

        In connection with any loss suffered by the Company or any Company related party arising out of or in connection with the merger
agreement, the financing letters or the limited guarantees and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including as a result of
the failure of the transactions contemplated thereby to be consummated or for a breach (including willful breach) or failure to perform
thereunder or otherwise (other than in the circumstances in which the Company is entitled to receive the Parent termination fee), the
maximum aggregate monetary liability of Parent and the Parent related parties is limited to the amount of the Parent termination fee, and in no
event may the Company seek or be entitled to recover from Parent or any Parent related party any monetary damages in excess of such
amount, except with respect to indemnification for or reimbursement of any applicable expenses pursuant to certain provisions of the merger
agreement.

        In connection with any loss suffered by Parent, Merger Sub, any guarantor, the financing sources or any of their respective
representatives or any of their respective affiliates as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to be
consummated or for a breach or failure

to perform thereunder or otherwise, other than in the circumstances in which Parent is entitled to receive the Company termination fee, the
maximum aggregate monetary liability of the Company and the Company related parties is limited to the amount of the Company termination
fee, and in no event may Parent seek or be entitled to recover from the Company or any Company related party any monetary damages in
excess of such amount.

Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction 

        The merger agreement is governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions
other than those of the State of Delaware. Except as specifically set forth in the debt commitment letters, all claims or causes of action
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the debt financing sources in any way relating to the debt
commitment letters or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York. Each of the parties to the merger agreement consented to submit itself to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the merger agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement.

Required Vote; Recommendation of the Board 

        The vote on this proposal to adopt the merger agreement is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the nonbinding advisory proposal
regarding "golden parachute" compensation and the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote "FOR" either or both of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute"
compensation and the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and vote
"AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" for this proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        The approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock entitled to
vote thereon as of the record date.

        The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the proposal to adopt of the merger agreement.

AMENDMENT TO COMPANY BY-LAWS 

        On June 28, 2017, the Board adopted an amendment, which we refer to as the by-law amendment, to our by-laws. The by-law
amendment, which was effective upon adoption by the Board, designates the Delaware Court of Chancery as the sole and exclusive forum for
any stockholder to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach
of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Company to the Company or
the Company's stockholders, including, without limitation, a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (iii) any
action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our by-laws (as each may be
amended from time to time) or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Delaware Court of Chancery, or (iv) any action asserting a
claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.

NONBINDING ADVISORY PROPOSAL REGARDING "GOLDEN PARACHUTE" COMPENSATION (PROPOSAL TWO) 

        In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act, we are providing stockholders with
the opportunity to cast a nonbinding advisory vote with respect to certain payments that may be made to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger, or "golden parachute" compensation, as reported on the Golden Parachute Compensation table on page 91.

        Accordingly we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:

"RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in
connection with the merger, as disclosed in the table in the section of the proxy statement entitled 'The Merger—Interests of
Certain Persons in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation' including the associated narrative discussion, is hereby
approved."

        The vote on this proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and the proposal to
approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote "FOR" either or
both of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary
or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement and vote "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" for this nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation
(and vice versa).

        Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Company, the Board, the Board's compensation committee, Parent or any
affiliate of Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder
approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger agreement is adopted by the stockholders and the merger
is completed, the "golden parachute" compensation will still be paid to our named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with
the terms of such compensation.

        The approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of all of the shares present or
represented at the special meeting and voting on such proposal.

        The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute"
compensation.

AUTHORITY TO ADJOURN THE SPECIAL MEETING (PROPOSAL THREE) 

        We will ask our stockholders to vote only on this Proposal Three and not on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or the
nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation, if the Board determines to adjourn the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal
to adopt the merger agreement.

        In this proposal, we are asking our stockholders to approve a proposal to authorize the Board, in its discretion, to adjourn the special
meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If our stockholders approve the adjournment of the special meeting, we could adjourn the special
meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of
proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the merger agreement.

        The vote on this proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and the nonbinding
advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation. Accordingly, you may vote "FOR" either or both of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement and the nonbinding advisory proposal regarding "golden parachute" compensation and vote "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN"
for the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement (and vice versa).

        The approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of all of the shares present or
represented at the special meeting and voting on such proposal.

        The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special
meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to
approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS 

        If the merger is completed, under Section 262 of the DGCL, holders of record of Company common stock who do not vote in favor of
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, who properly demand appraisal of their shares, who do not withdraw such demand or otherwise
waive or lose their right to appraisal and who otherwise comply with the requirements for perfecting and preserving their appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to receive, in lieu of the consideration being offered in the merger, payment in cash for the
fair value of their shares of Company common stock (as of the effective time of the merger exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger) as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery in an appraisal proceeding, together with
interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. These rights are
known as appraisal rights. Stockholders electing to exercise appraisal rights must strictly comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL in order to perfect and preserve their rights. Failure to strictly comply with the procedures specified in Section 262 of the DGCL
in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.

        The following is intended as a brief summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL. The following, however, is not a
complete summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of
the DGCL, which is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement.

        Under Section 262 of the DGCL, when a merger is submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation must notify each
of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL must be included with
such notice. This proxy statement constitutes the Company's notice to its stockholders of the availability of appraisal rights in
connection with the merger and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D.

        Stockholders who may wish to exercise their appraisal rights or may wish to preserve their right to do so should review carefully
the discussion in this section and Annex D in its entirety and should consult with their legal advisor, since failure to timely comply
with the procedures set forth therein will result in the loss of such rights. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will
nonetheless be entitled to receive the $10.25 per share cash merger consideration.

        Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to demand appraisal of their shares of Company common stock under Section 262 of the
DGCL must satisfy each of the following conditions:

• The stockholder must not vote his, her or its shares of Company common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement. Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of
the merger agreement, a stockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must provide instructions in any such proxy to
vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or otherwise attend the special meeting and vote against the adoption of the
merger agreement, or abstain from voting. 

• As more fully described below, the stockholder must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal of his, her or its
shares of Company common stock before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting is taken.
This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against
the adoption of the merger agreement. Voting "AGAINST" or failing to vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement by
itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL.

Table of Contents

• The stockholder must hold his, her or its shares of Company common stock, either of record or beneficially, on the date of
making the demand for appraisal and must continuously hold such shares from the date of making the demand through the
effective date of the merger. 

• The stockholder (or the surviving corporation in the merger) must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery
requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares of Company common stock within 120 days after the effective date of
the merger. The surviving corporation of the merger is under no obligation to file any such petition and has no present
intention of doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the stockholder to initiate all necessary action to perfect his, her or its
appraisal rights in respect of his, her or its shares of Company common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the
DGCL.

        If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the $10.25 per share
merger consideration for your shares of Company common stock as provided for in the merger agreement, but you will have no appraisal
rights with respect to your shares of Company common stock.

        All demands for appraisal must be addressed to our Secretary at Staples, Inc., Five Hundred Staples Drive, Framingham, Massachusetts
01702, and must be delivered before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement is taken at the special meeting, and must be executed
by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the shares of Company common stock for which appraisal is demanded.

        In addition, the demand must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby
to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares in connection with the merger. To be effective, a demand for appraisal by a holder of Company
common stock must be made by, or in the name of, such registered stockholder, fully and correctly, as the stockholder's name appears on the
stock ledger of the Company and on his, her or its stock certificate(s), if any.

        Beneficial owners who do not also hold the shares of record may not directly make appraisal demands to the Company. The beneficial
holder must, in such cases, have the registered owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect
of those shares.

        If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal
should be made in that capacity. If the shares are owned of record jointly by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in
common, the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners.

        An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal on behalf of a
stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the
demand, he or she is acting as agent for the record owners.

        A record holder, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee who holds shares as a nominee for several beneficial owners, may
exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial
owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares is
expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of the record owner. If you hold your shares of
Company common stock in a bank, a brokerage account or other nominee form and wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should
consult with your bank or broker or the other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the nominee to make a demand
for appraisal. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Company common stock held of record in the name of another
person, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to properly follow the steps
summarized herein and perfect appraisal rights in a timely manner.

        Within 10 days after the effective date of the merger, the surviving corporation in the merger will provide notice of the date the merger
has become effective to each former stockholder of the Company who has properly demanded an appraisal of their shares of Company
common stock under Section 262 of the DGCL and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. At any time within
60 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has demanded an appraisal, but who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party, has the right to withdraw the demand and to accept the merger consideration offered
pursuant to the merger agreement. Any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will require the
written approval of the surviving corporation. No appraisal proceeding before the Delaware Court of Chancery as to any stockholder will be
dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, which approval may be conditioned upon any terms the Delaware Court
of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding
as a named party may withdraw its demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement within
60 days after the effective date of the merger. If the surviving corporation does not approve a stockholder's request to withdraw a demand for
appraisal when the approval is required or, except with respect to a stockholder that withdraws his, her or its right to appraisal in accordance
with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal
proceeding, the stockholder would be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding. This value
could be greater than, less than, or the same as the value of the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement.

        Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, either the surviving corporation or any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery
demanding a determination of the value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. Upon the filing of the petition by a
stockholder, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the surviving corporation. The surviving corporation has no obligation or
present intention to file such a petition in the event there are dissenting stockholders. Accordingly, the failure of a stockholder to file such a
petition within the time period and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL could nullify the stockholder's previously submitted
written demand for appraisal.

        Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL, or a beneficial
owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such beneficial owner, shall, upon written request to the surviving
corporation, be entitled to receive a written statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger agreement
and with respect to which demands for appraisal rights have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written
statement must be mailed to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after such written request is received by the surviving corporation or
within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.

        If a petition for appraisal is duly and timely filed by a stockholder, the stockholder must deliver a copy of the petition to the surviving
corporation, and the surviving corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide
the Register in Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of
their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving corporation. The Delaware
Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing upon the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262
of the DGCL and who have become entitled to the appraisal rights provided thereby. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Delaware
Court of Chancery, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving
corporation and to the stockholders shown on such list at the addresses therein stated. The Delaware Court of Chancery

may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their stock
certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to
comply with such direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder. The Delaware Court of
Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless the total number of
shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Company common stock eligible for appraisal or the value of the
consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.

        After the Delaware Court of Chancery's determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of our common stock, an
appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically
governing appraisal proceedings. Through this proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares of
Company common stock as of the effective time of the merger exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware
Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date
of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the
judgment. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such fair value, with interest, if any, by
the surviving corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving
corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the
surviving corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its
discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder
whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving corporation pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and who has submitted such
stockholder's stock certificates to the Register in Chancery, if such submission is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.

        In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v.
UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding,
stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court" should be considered and that "[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company." The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value,
asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained as of the date of the
merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be
"exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the
Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but which
rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware
Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are
known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered." An opinion of an
investment banking firm as to

Table of Contents

the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner
address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of their shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be
greater than, the same as, or less than the value of the merger consideration. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of
fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. In addition, Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy,
depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenter's exclusive remedy. You should be aware that the fair value of your
shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration that
you would otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement. The Company does not anticipate offering
greater than the merger consideration to any stockholder who exercises appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any
appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the fair value of the Common Stock shares is less than the
merger consideration.

        Costs of the appraisal proceeding may be imposed upon the surviving corporation and the stockholders participating in the appraisal
proceeding by the Delaware Court of Chancery as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon the
application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be
charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to appraisal. Any stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will not, after the
effective date of the merger, be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to receive payments of dividends or any other distribution with
respect to those shares, other than dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to the effective date of the
merger; however, if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, or if the stockholder delivers a
written withdrawal of his, her or its demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the terms of the merger, either within 60 days after the
effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of that stockholder to appraisal will cease
and that stockholder will be entitled to receive the merger consideration, without interest, for shares of his, her or its common stock pursuant
to the merger agreement.

        In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, our stockholders who may wish to dissent from the merger and pursue
appraisal rights should consult their legal advisor. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and
Section 262 of the DGCL, the DGCL shall govern.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK 

        If the merger is consummated, the Company common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market and deregistered under the
Exchange Act and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of the Company common stock.

CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED 

        In the event that the merger agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, our
stockholders will not receive any consideration from Parent or Merger Sub for their shares of Company common stock. Instead, we would
remain an independent public company, our common stock would continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market and our
stockholders would continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they currently are subject with respect to their
ownership of Company common stock. If the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and
opportunities on the future value of our shares, including the risk that the market price of Company common stock may decline to the extent
that the current market price of our stock reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. If the merger is not completed, our
business could be disrupted, including our ability to retain and hire key personnel, potential adverse reactions or changes to our business
relationships and uncertainty surrounding our future plans and prospects.

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, we are permitted to terminate the merger agreement and to accept a
superior proposal. See "The Merger Agreement—Termination" beginning on page 125.

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, if the merger is not completed, we may be obligated to pay Parent a
termination fee or Parent may be obligated to pay us a termination fee. See "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees" beginning on page

OTHER MATTERS 

Other Matters for Action at the Special Meeting 

        As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board knows of no matters that will be presented for consideration at the special meeting other
than as described in this proxy statement.

Future Stockholder Proposals 

        If the merger is consummated, we will not have public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meeting of
stockholders of the Company. However, if the merger is not consummated, we expect to hold our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, which
we refer to as the 2018 annual meeting, in June 2018, although the Company reserves the right to delay its annual meeting as may be
permitted under applicable law.

        If the merger is not consummated and we hold our 2018 annual meeting within 30 days before or after the date of our 2017 annual
meeting of stockholders, under SEC rules, a stockholder who intends to present a proposal, including nomination of a director, at our 2018
annual meeting and who wishes the proposal to be included in the proxy statement and proxy card for that meeting, must submit the proposal
in writing to: Corporate Secretary, Staples, Inc., Five Hundred Staples Drive, Framingham, Massachusetts 01702, before not later than
December 27, 2017. SEC rules set standards for the types of stockholder proposals and the information that must be provided by the
stockholder making the request.

        If you wish to present a proposal or nominate a director candidate for election at the 2018 annual meeting, but do not wish to have the
proposal considered for inclusion in our proxy statement and proxy card, you must give us advance notice and provide the information
required by our by-laws, including but not limited to, information regarding the identity of the stockholder or beneficial owner, their holdings
in the Company's securities, agreements or compensation relating to such nomination or matter, and any derivatives or other arrangements to
mitigate risk or change voting power. If a stockholder gives notice of such a proposal or nomination after the applicable deadline, the
stockholder will not be permitted to present the proposal or nomination to the stockholder for a vote at the meeting. For our 2018 annual
meeting, our Corporate Secretary generally must receive such a notice at Five Hundred Staples Drive, Framingham, Massachusetts 01702 not
later than 90 days and no earlier than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of our 2017 annual meeting. However, if the date of our 2018
annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be received no
earlier than 120 days prior to the 2018 annual meeting and not later than the later of (i) the 90th day prior to the 2018 annual meeting and
(ii) the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the 2018 annual meeting is made or notice for the 2018
annual meeting was mailed, whichever occurs first.

        Our proxy access bylaw allows a stockholder, or a group of up to 25 stockholders, owning 3% or more of our outstanding common stock
continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in our proxy materials director nominees constituting up to two individuals or
20% of the Board (whichever is greater), provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in Article I,
Section 7.4 of our by-laws. Notice of any such nomination must be received by the Corporate Secretary at Five Hundred Staples Drive,
Framingham, Massachusetts 01702, not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day, nor earlier than the close of business on
the one hundred twentieth (120th) day, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. For the 2018 annual meeting,
notice of proxy access nominations must be received no earlier than February 12, 2018 and no later than March 14, 2018. However, if the date
of our 2018 annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be
received no earlier than 120 days prior to the 2017 annual meeting and not later than the later of (i) the 90th day prior to the 2017 annual
meeting and (ii) the tenth day following the

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

        1.1    The Merger.     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, the
Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company at the Effective Time.

        1.2    Effective Time of the Merger.     Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger or other
appropriate documents (in any such case, the "Certificate of Merger") to be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and filed with the Secretary of State. The Merger shall become effective upon the due filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State or at such subsequent time or date as the Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in
the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

        1.3    Closing.     Subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted herein and by applicable law) of the conditions set forth in
Article VII, the Closing shall take place at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, MA 02109 as
soon as practicable (but in any event no later than the third Business Day) following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of such conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement, or at such other date, time or place as
the parties hereto shall agree in writing; provided that, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), then, subject to the continued satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII at such time, the Closing shall occur instead on the earliest of (a) any Business Day during the Marketing Period as may be
specified by Parent on no less than three Business Days' prior written notice to the Company, (b) the third (3rd) Business Day following the
final day of the Marketing Period or (c) such other date, time or place as agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company.

        1.4    Effects of the Merger.     At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease, the Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and (b) the certificate of
incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set
forth on Exhibit A, and as so amended and restated shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter further
amended in accordance with the DGCL. In addition, subject to Section 6.6(b) hereof, the Parent shall cause the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to be amended and restated in their entirety so that, immediately following the Effective Time, they are identical to the bylaws of
the Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to the name of the Merger Sub therein shall be
changed to refer to the name of the Company, and, as so amended and restated, such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
until further amended in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL and in this
Agreement.

        1.5    Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.     The directors of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case to hold office in accordance with the term of office set forth in certificate of

ARTICLE II

TREATMENT OF COMPANY SECURITIES 

        2.1    Conversion of Capital Stock.     As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, the Merger Sub, the Parent or the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Merger Sub:

        (a)    Capital Stock of the Merger Sub.    Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

        (b)    Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.    All shares of Company Common Stock that are held in the
treasury of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by any Subsidiary of the Company, the Parent, the
Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of the Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no consideration shall be paid or delivered in exchange therefor.

        (c)    Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock.    Except as otherwise agreed in writing between the holder and Parent,
subject to Section 2.2, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to
receive $10.25, without interest thereon (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2.

        (d)    Adjustments to Merger Consideration.    The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for
which a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

        2.2    Surrender of Certificates.     

        (a)    Paying Agent.    At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall (i) enter into an agreement (in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company) with the Paying Agent for the Paying Agent to act as paying agent for the Merger and
(ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited (including by directing that available cash of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries (including, if
requested by Parent no later than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, any cash proceeds received upon liquidating any
investments held in highly liquid short-term interest-bearing investments in the United States) be deposited with the Paying Agent at
the Effective Time), with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment through the Paying Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2, the Payment
Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Parent; provided, however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available); provided,
however, that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable

hereunder and the Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Payment Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy
the Parent's obligation to pay the Merger Consideration under this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments (net of any losses) shall be paid to the Parent pursuant to Section 2.2(e). In the event the Payment Fund is diminished
below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payments as required under Section 2.2(b), including any such
diminishment as a result of investment losses, the Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, immediately deposit
additional cash into the Payment Fund in an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payments.

        (b)    Exchange Procedures.    

          (i)  Promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall (1) be prepared prior to the
Closing, (2) specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) to the Paying Agent, and (3) otherwise be in
such form and have such provisions as may be reasonably acceptable to the Parent and the Company), and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) in exchange
for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
as provided in Section 2.2(g)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be promptly paid in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to
(1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) multiplied by (2) the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled.

         (ii)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of Uncertificated Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more
Uncertificated Shares shall, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's message" in customary form with respect to any
Uncertificated Share (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be promptly
paid the Merger Consideration in respect of such Uncertificated Share, and such Uncertificated Share shall forthwith be
cancelled.

        (c)    Interest; Transfers; Rights Following the Effective Time.    No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender of such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is registered, if, in the case of a Certificate, such Certificate is presented
to the Paying Agent, and in each case the transferor provides to Paying Agent (i) all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and (ii) evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate and all Uncertificated Shares (other than Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing Dissenting
Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.1(c).

        (d)    No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.    All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Certificates and cancellation of Uncertificated Shares in accordance

with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II, subject to Section 2.2(e).

        (e)    Termination of Payment Fund.    Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates
and Uncertificated Shares for one year after the Effective Time (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent
in respect of all funds made available to it) shall be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall be entitled to receive only from the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) payment of its claim for Merger Consideration,
without interest.

Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount required to be
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

        (g)    Lost Certificates.    If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if reasonably required by the Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as the Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to this
Agreement.

        2.3    Company Stock Plans.     

        (a)   Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the holder and Parent, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each then-outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option shall automatically be canceled and converted into the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock then underlying such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per share of such Company Stock Option, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate amount payable by the Surviving Corporation to the holders of such Company
Stock Options pursuant to the preceding sentence, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding, upon the
later of (A) five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date and (B) the date of the Company's first regularly scheduled payroll after the
Closing Date. In the event that the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such Company Stock Option shall be canceled, without any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force
or effect.

power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly
qualified to do business and, where applicable as a legal concept, is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the
character of the properties it owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes such qualification legally required, except for such
failures to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, that are not reasonably likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent has delivered or made available to the Company complete and correct copies of the certificate or articles of
incorporation and bylaws, or similar organizational documents as amended through the date of this Agreement, of Merger Sub and Parent.

and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement by the Parent and the Merger Sub have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each of the Parent and the Merger Sub, subject to the adoption of this
Agreement by the Parent as the sole stockholder of the Merger Sub (which shall occur immediately after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of the Parent and the Merger Sub and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each of

the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Parent or the Merger Sub, (ii) conflict with, or result
in any violation or breach of, or constitute a default (or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or loss of any material benefit) under, or require a consent or waiver under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any lease, license, contract or other agreement, instrument or obligation to which the Parent or the Merger Sub is a party or by which
any of them or any of their properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) subject to compliance with the requirements specified in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of Section 4.2(c), conflict with or violate any permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment,
injunction, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Parent or the Merger Sub or any of its or their

executed commitment letters, dated as of the date hereof (collectively, the "Equity Funding Letters" and each, an "Equity Funding Letter"),
from the Guarantors, pursuant to which the Guarantors (the "Equity Financing Sources") have agreed to make an equity investment in Parent,
subject to the terms and conditions therein, in cash in the aggregate amounts set forth therein (the "Equity Financing") and (b) the executed
commitment letter and Redacted Fee Letter (together with the term sheet and any other annexes, exhibits, schedules and other attachments
thereto), dated as of the date hereof (collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letter" and, together with the Equity Funding Letters, the
"Financing Letters"), from the Debt Financing Sources, pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have agreed to provide, severally and

the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.2, 3.5(b), 3.6 and 3.7(b) (as it relates to Section 5.1(a)) and performance in all
material respects by the Company of its obligations under Sections 5.1(a) and 5.1(g), the net proceeds contemplated by the Financing Letters
(after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges and after giving effect to the maximum
amount of flex (including original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt Commitment Letter), together with the cash of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (it being acknowledged that the Company makes no representation or warranty as to the amount
or availability of cash as of the Effective Time), will in the aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (and any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by, or required in connection with the transactions
described in, this Agreement, the Equity Funding Letters or the Debt Commitment Letter) and any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including all amounts payable in respect of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs,
Company July 2017 RSUs and Company Performance Share Awards under this Agreement) and to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent
and Merger Sub. The Financing Letters are (x) legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to the
knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, each of the other parties thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against
Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, each of the other parties thereto, in each case except
as such enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception and (z) in full force and effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or any other parties thereto under the Equity Funding Letters or the Debt Commitment
Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that it or any of the other parties to the Financing Letters
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Letters required to be satisfied by it, that the conditions
thereof will not otherwise be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing will not be available on the Closing Date. The only conditions
precedent or other contingencies (including market "flex" provisions) related to the obligations of the Guarantor to fund the full amount of the
Equity Financing and the lenders to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing are those expressly set forth in the Equity Funding Letters and
the Debt Commitment Letter, respectively. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements to
which Parent or any of its Affiliates are a party related to the Financing other than as expressly contained in the Financing Letters and
delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof (other than any customary engagement letter or any side letter solely with respect to the
payment of de minimis fees, credits, and/or appointment of roles and/or titles, in each case that does not impact the conditionality or amount
of the Financing and would not reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or delay the consummation of the Financing).

        4.6    Limited Guarantees.     Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a duly executed
limited guarantee of each Guarantor, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in favor of the Company in respect of Parent's obligation to pay
the Parent Termination Fee and certain of Parent's and Merger Sub's other payment or reimbursement obligations arising under, or in
connection with, this Agreement and the Transactions, up to the aggregate amount set forth therein (the "Limited Guarantee"), subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein. Each Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Guarantor party thereto, enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception and
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or
breach on the part of the Guarantor under such Limited Guarantee.

        4.7    Solvency.     None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor is entering into this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any

(b) any estimates, projections or forecasts prepared by the Company or its Representatives and made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their
Representatives prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith based upon reasonable assumptions (it being understood that the
Company is not making any representation and warranty with respect thereto as a result of such assumption in this clause (b)) and (c) the
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III hereof (for such purposes, such representations and warranties shall be
true and correct in all material respects without giving any effect to any "knowledge", "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect"
qualification or exception), including the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.5, and after giving effect to the Transactions,
any alternative financing incurred in accordance with Section 6.11 and the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, any other
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Letters, payment of all amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, and payment of all related fees and expenses of Parent and Merger Sub, each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the Transactions
and in the event either the USR ABL Borrower (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) or CAR ABL Borrower (as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter) have borrowed funds under the Debt Financing on the Closing Date to finance the Transactions, each of such CAR ABL
Borrower and such USR ABL Borrower will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the
Transactions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent", when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of
determination, (a) the fair value of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, at a fair valuation, will exceed the
debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (b) the present
fair saleable value of the property of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be greater than the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liability of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis on their debts and other liabilities, direct,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured, (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis will not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the businesses in which they are engaged as such
businesses are now conducted and are proposed to be conducted following the Closing Date and (d) such Person and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis will be able to pay their debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities
become absolute and matured.

"Affiliates" or "Associates" (as those terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) (a) directly or indirectly "owns" or, within the three
(3) years prior to the date hereof, has "owned," beneficially or otherwise, any shares of Company Common Stock, any other securities of the
Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any
other economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in the Company, or (b) has been an "Affiliate" or "Associate" (as those
terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of the Company at any time during the three (3) years prior to the date hereof. Assuming the
accuracy of the Company's representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2(a) and the second sentence of Section 3.4(a), the restrictions
contained in Section 203 of the DGCL do not apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the

have made itself and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives available and the Company shall have and shall have
caused its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to discuss and negotiate with the Parent's Representatives any
proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (in a manner that would obviate the need to effect such
Company Board Recommendation Change) during the four (4) Business Day period following delivery by the Company to the Parent
of such Recommendation Change Notice (it being understood that if there are any material amendments, revisions or changes to the
terms of any such Superior Proposal (including any revision to the amount, form or mix of consideration the Company's stockholders
would receive as a result of the Superior Proposal, whether or not material), the Company shall notify the Parent of each such
amendment, revision or change in compliance with Section 6.1(c) and the applicable four (4) Business Day period described above
shall be extended for until at least two (2) Business Days from the date of such notice) (any such notice period, the "Notice Period");
and (iv) at the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel), after considering any modified terms and conditions proposed by or on behalf of the Parent, that the failure to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law
and, with respect to a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such initial or revised (as
applicable) Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.

        (c)    Notices to the Parent.    The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) advise the Parent
orally and in writing of the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' or any of their respective Representatives' receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or request for material non-public information or access to the Company or its Representatives by any third party that the
Company reasonably believes is related to an Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and
conditions of any such request for information or access or Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making any such
Acquisition Proposal. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis of any material developments
with respect to any such request for information or access or Acquisition Proposal, including with respect to the terms and status
thereof and whether any such Acquisition Proposal has been withdrawn or rejected and shall provide Parent written notice of any such
withdrawal or rejection and copies of any written request for information or access or Acquisition Proposal within 48 hours. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits
the Company from providing to the Parent the information or access required to be provided to the Parent pursuant to this
Section 6.1(c).

        (d)    Certain Permitted Disclosure.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with
respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop,
look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder (none of which, in and of itself, shall be deemed to constitute a
Company Board Recommendation Change), or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided that this Section 6.1(d) shall not permit the Company Board to
make a Company Board Recommendation Change except to the extent expressly permitted by, and in accordance with, Section 6.1(b).
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.1(d) shall not be deemed to modify the definition of "Company Board Recommendation
Change," and if any public disclosure in accordance with this

by the terms of this Agreement) or (B) that in the reasonable judgment of the Company (after consultation with outside legal counsel)
would: (1) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of any third party, (2) violate any legal requirement or Contract or any
obligation of the Company with respect to confidentiality or privacy, including under any privacy policy, or (3) jeopardize protections
afforded the Company under the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine (provided that in connection with this
clause (B), the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements (including a joint
defense agreement) to permit reasonable disclosure, to the extent permitted by applicable law and practicable under the
circumstances). Any such information shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Prior to the Closing, neither the Parent nor
the Merger Sub shall (and each shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to) contact or communicate with any of the
employees, customers, licensors or suppliers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of the
Company.

        6.4    Legal Conditions to the Merger.     

        (a)   Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.1, Section 6.4(b), Section 6.4(c) and Section 6.4(d), each party hereto shall
each use its reasonable best efforts to:

          (i)  take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties
hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable;

         (ii)  as promptly as practicable, obtain any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders
required to be obtained by such party (or any of its Subsidiaries) from any Governmental Entity or third party in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that in no event shall the Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries be required
to pay any monies (except for filings or similar fees) or (except, in the case of the Parent or its Subsidiaries, as contemplated
by Section 6.4(d)) agree to any material undertaking in connection with any of the foregoing;

        (iii)  as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state
securities laws, (B) the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Laws and any related governmental request thereunder and
(C) any other applicable law;

        (iv)  contest and resist any action, including any administrative or judicial action, and seek to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (a
"Restrictive Order") which has the effect of making the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger
or the other Transactions; and

         (v)  execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully
carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such filings and submissions contemplated by
the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii), including providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing Person and its advisors prior to
filing (to the extent permitted under applicable law) and, if requested, accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
in connection therewith. Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable law in connection with the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing contained in this Section 6.4(a) shall limit any obligation under any other provision in this Section 6.4.

        (b)   Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.4, each of the Parent and the Company shall (i) as
soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, if required, make
an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act (including seeking early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act) with respect to the Transactions and (ii) promptly make all filings as may be required under any other
applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions (to the extent required). None of the Parent, the Merger Sub or the
Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws or enter into a timing agreement with any Governmental Entity, without the prior written
consent of the other parties.

        (c)   Subject to the terms hereof, and without limiting the Parent's obligations under Section 6.4(d), the parties hereto shall, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any government
clearances or approvals required for the Closing under any Antitrust Law, to respond to any government requests for information
under any Antitrust Law, to cause any waiting periods under any applicable Antitrust Laws to expire or be terminated, and to contest
and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any Restrictive Order. The parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or
relating to any Antitrust Law, provided, however, that materials provided according to this Section 6.4(c) or Section 6.4(a) may be
redacted: (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) as necessary to comply with
applicable laws; and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege concerns. To the extent permitted by law
or Governmental Entities reviewing the Transactions, the parties will provide each other the opportunity to participate in meetings and
other substantive conversations with any such Governmental Entities.

        (d)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parent shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect
(and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of the Parent or, effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, or their
respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is
accepted, take or commit to take such action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the
businesses, services or assets of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution of, any Restrictive Order, which would have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the
Outside Date, provided that Parent shall not be obligated to take any such action unless the taking of such action is expressly
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent shall take any and all actions necessary in
order to ensure that (i) no requirement for a waiver, consent, approval or termination of applicable waiting periods of the Federal
Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, any State Attorney General or other Governmental Entity,
(ii) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding, and (iii) no other matter
relating to any Antitrust Law, would preclude consummation of the Merger by the Outside Date.

        6.5    Public Disclosure.     Except as may be required by law or stock market regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution
of this Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Parent, (b) Parent and the
Company shall mutually agree upon the form and substance of any (i) widespread internal written communications (including scripts, Q&A
materials, talking points and similar written materials) that may be made by the Company to its officers, employees, independent contractors,
consultants, directors, suppliers, customers, contract counterparties and/or other business relations of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger, this Agreement, the Transactions, the Financing and/or the Carveout Transactions and/or (ii) any other press release or
other public statement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement, the Transactions, the Financing and/or the Carveout Transactions, in the
case of clause (b) that is not limited to or consistent with previous mutually agreed upon public statements and (c) the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with Parent prior to making any widespread internal oral communications to its employees (it
being agreed this clause (c) shall not restrict the ability of members of the Company's management team from responding to questions from
employees,

Section 6.1, these restrictions shall not apply to any Company communications (or the Parent's or the Merger Sub's response thereto) in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, Company Board Recommendation Change or Recommendation Change Notice.

        6.6    Indemnification.     

        (a)   From and after the Effective Time, each of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party
is or was an officer, director or manager of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, while a director, manager or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as an officer, director or
manager of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company
would have been permitted to do so by law. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses (including attorneys'
fees) incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation within 10 Business Days of receipt by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request
therefor; provided that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are to be advanced provides prior to any receipt of such advances an
undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL or other applicable law, to repay such advances if it is determined by a final
determination of a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal) that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification under applicable law. Without limitation of the foregoing or any other provision of this Section 6.6, until
the six-year anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Parent and the Company agree that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party, whether provided in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof,
shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

        (b)   From the Effective Time through the six-year anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and the Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

        (c)   Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall either (i) maintain, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time the Current D&O
Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Transactions), so long as the
annual premium therefor would not exceed the Maximum Premium, or (ii) purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement for an annual cost
not to exceed the Maximum Premium and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. If the Company's or the
Surviving Corporation's existing insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such six-year

period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain, as much directors' and officers' liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties
than the Current D&O Insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may, prior to the
Effective Time and using a nationally recognized broker selected by Parent in consultation with the Company (whose consent to using
such broker shall not be unreasonably withheld), purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement, provided that the Company does not pay
more than the Maximum Premium for such Reporting Tail Endorsement. If a Reporting Tail Endorsement has been purchased by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause such Reporting Tail Endorsement to be maintained in full force and effect
for its full term and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation and in such case it will be deemed to
satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 6.6(c).

        (d)   In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume and
succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

        (e)   If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.6 that is
denied by the Parent and/or the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or advancement of expenses, then the Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the Indemnified Party's costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with pursuing his or her claims to the fullest extent permitted by law.

        (f)    The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to any Indemnified Party by
law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties, their heirs and their representatives.

        6.7    Notification of Certain Matters.     Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the
Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is
reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such Person (or, in case of the Parent's obligation to provide notice, any
representation or warranty of the Merger Sub) contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate (i) in the case of any representation or
warranty of the Company, in any manner that would result in the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or (ii) in the case of any
representation or warranty of the Parent or the Merger Sub, in any manner that would result in the failure of the condition set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or (b) any material breach by such Person (or (x) in case of the Parent's obligation to provide notice, any material breach by the
Merger Sub or (y) in the case of the Company's obligations under Section 6.1, any material breach by any Representative attributed to the
Company pursuant to Section 6.1(f)) of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, (c) any written notice or other written
communication from any Governmental Entity or counterparty to a Company Material Contract alleging that the consent of such
Governmental Entity or such counterparty, as applicable, is required in connection with the Transactions, or (d) any actions, suits claims or
proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge (in the case of the Company, the Company's Knowledge), threatened in writing against such
Person or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of the Transactions. The parties hereto agree that (i) the Company's

failure to comply with this Section 6.7 shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the condition referred to in
Section 7.3(b) has been satisfied and (ii) the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall not, in and of itself, affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Transactions
or the remedies available to the parties hereunder.

        6.8    Employee Benefits Matters.     

        (a)   Subject to the foregoing, for a period of one year following the Effective Time (or, if shorter, the period of employment of
the relevant Company Employee), the Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, (i) to each Company Employee a total
compensation package no less favorable in the aggregate than the total compensation package (including base salary or wage rates,
commissions and target annual cash bonus opportunities but excluding the value of annual equity awards and cash payments in lieu of
equity awards) provided to such Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) to all Company Employees in the
aggregate other employee benefits (other than the Company ESPP, long-term incentive or defined benefit pension or equity awards or
cash payments in lieu thereof) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other benefits provided to such Company
Employees immediately before the Effective Time.

        (b)   For purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate (but not for accrual or level of benefits) under the New Plans, each
Company Employee shall, subject to applicable law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Employee Plan in
which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in
any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is of the same type as the Company Employee Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (ii)(A) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, the Parent shall
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old Plan of the Company
or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Parent shall
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such
New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

        (c)   If any Company Employee (who is not otherwise a party to an employment agreement, offer letter or similar agreement or
arrangement or any amendment or supplement of any of the foregoing, in each case that provides for a different treatment with respect
to severance) whose employment is terminated on or prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time under circumstances under
which such Company Employee would have received severance benefits under the Company Severance Policy, the Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide that such Company Employee shall be entitled to severance benefits from the Surviving
Corporation that are no less favorable than the severance benefits that would have been granted under the Company Severance Policy
as in existence on the date of this Agreement and shall notify such Company Employee of such benefits in a manner consistent with
the Company's past practices prior to the date of this Agreement.

        (d)   From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to assume, in
accordance with their terms, all obligations of the Company under contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and
commitments of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof and in the form
provided to Parent prior to the date hereof that are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, including any employment, severance, and termination plans and agreements.

        (e)   All provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to employee benefit plans or employee compensation are included
for the sole benefit of the respective Parties and shall not create any right (including any third party beneficiary rights) in any other
Person, including any employee or former employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any participant or beneficiary in any
Company Employee Plan. Nothing in this Agreement (i) shall require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries to
continue to employ any particular Company Employee following the Effective Time or to provide any right to a particular term or
condition of employment, (ii) shall, for a period of one year following the Effective Time, permit the reduction of the existing
severance or acceleration benefits in effect on the date of this Agreement for any Company Employee, or (iii) except as provided in
the foregoing clause (ii), shall be construed to prohibit Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries from amending
or terminating any Employee Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms or to amend or create any Employee Benefit Plan or any
similar plan or agreement from Parent or its Affiliates. The provisions of Sections 6.8(a) through 6.8(c) shall not apply to persons
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries outside the United States or covered by collective bargaining or other labor
agreements, it being agreed that such persons shall be treated in accordance with applicable law and the terms of any contracts
covering them.

        6.9    State Takeover Laws.     The Company and the Company Board shall not take any action that would cause any anti-takeover or
other similar law to become applicable to restrict or prohibit the Merger or any other Transactions. If any "fair price," "business combination"
or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation is or may become applicable to any of the Transactions, the parties
hereto shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such
actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or, if unable to be eliminated, minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on such
transactions; provided that, the Parent and the Merger Sub shall only be required to take any action pursuant to this Section 6.9 if they have
received written notice from the Company regarding the applicability of such statute or regulation and the Company has requested in such
written notice that the Parent and the Merger Sub take specified actions to render such statute or regulation inapplicable.

        6.10    Rule 16b-3.     Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all reasonable steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or
officer of the Company and who would otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to be exempt under such rule
to the extent permitted by applicable law.

        6.11    Financing.     (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the
Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions (including the market flex provisions set forth in the Redacted Fee Letter) set forth

flex provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) satisfy (and cause its Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely (taking into account the
Marketing Period) basis all conditions applicable to Parent and its Affiliates in the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements related
thereto (or, if necessary or deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub contained in such
Financing Letter or such definitive agreements related thereto), (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing Date, (v) enforce its
rights under the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements relating to the Financing and (vi) comply with its covenants and other
obligations under the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements relating to the Financing. Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, take any action not otherwise required under this Agreement that is a breach of, or would result in termination of, any of the
Financing Letters. Parent, Merger Sub and the Guarantors shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree to or permit any
termination of or amendment, supplement or modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of any provision under, the Financing Letters or
the definitive agreements relating to the Financing if such termination, amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would be reasonably
likely to (A)(1) reduce (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of any portion of the Debt Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount) unless an alternative source of the Equity Financing or other financing is
increased by a corresponding amount, so long as in the case of such alternative source of Equity Financing or other financing, the terms
thereof are not of the type that would consitute a Prohibited Amendment under clauses (B) or (C) below, is then made available, including by
increasing the amount of the Equity Financing or (2) reduce the amount of Equity Financing unless the Debt Financing or alternative
financing is increased by a corresponding amount, so long as in the case of any alternative financing, the terms thereof are of the type that
would not constitute a Prohibited Amendment under clauses (B) or (C) below, (B) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect to the Financing or
(C) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the availability of the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions precedent to the Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any other provision of the Financing Letters in a manner that
could reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent or make less likely to occur the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date (taking into account the Marketing Period) (the amendments described in the foregoing
clauses (A), (B) and (C), the "Prohibited Amendments"). Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of any amendment,
modification, supplement, consent or waiver to or under any Financing Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing promptly
upon execution thereof other than (1) amendments or modifications solely for the purpose of joining additional arrangers or financing sources
following the date hereof to the extent effected pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or (2) any amendments or modifications
to the terms that have been redacted under the Redacted Fee Letter. In addition to and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall not
permit the consummation of the Carveout Transactions prior to the payment in full of the Merger Consideration unless the net cash proceeds
of the Carveout Transactions payable to the Company on the Closing Date equal or exceed the sum of (i) the amounts permitted to be
borrowed on the Closing Date under each of the CAR ABL Facility (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) and the USR ABL Facility

termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Letters or definitive documents related to the Financing
of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Financing Source with respect to any (A) actual or potential breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to
any of the Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters or any
definitive document related to the Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any of the
Financing Letters or any definitive document related to the Financing with respect to the conditionality or amount of the Financing or
the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing (but excluding ordinary course
negotiations) and (iii) of the occurrence of an event or development that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability
of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Transactions. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two Business Days of the date the Company
delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. If any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any applicable market flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter and alternative financing (so long as the terms thereof are of the type that would not constitute a Prohibited
Amendment) or an increase in the Equity Financing is not then made available in an amount equal to such portion, and such portion is
required to fund the Merger Consideration and all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent pursuant to this
Agreement, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain in replacement thereof, and negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing
from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions with terms and conditions (including market flex
provisions) not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and Merger Sub (or their respective Affiliates) than the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later
than the final day of the Marketing Period; provided, that in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed
to require Parent to (A) pay fees materially in excess of those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the market flex
provisions) or agree to "market flex" terms, materially less favorable to Parent than the corresponding market flex terms contained in
or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or (B) enter into any alternative financing terms the terms of which are materially
less favorable to Parent than the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof (taken as a whole). In furtherance
of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that (1) any portion of the Debt Financing anticipated under the Debt
Commitment Letter to be structured as a high yield bond financing is unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, and such amount
is not funded through a securities demand under the Debt Commitment Letter, (2) all conditions contained in Section 7.1 and
Section 7.3 have been satisfied or waived (other than (x) any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing, and (y) those conditions the failure of which to be satisfied is
attributable to a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement) and (3) a bridge facility contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or an alternative bridge facility or other financing
obtained in accordance with this Section 6.11(b)) is available on the terms described in the Debt Commitment Letter, then Parent and
Merger Sub shall cause the applicable Financing Sources to fund such bridge financing in accordance with the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter and the proceeds shall be used in lieu of the affected portion of the high yield bond financing. Parent shall deliver

reasonable judgment, unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries. In
no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to bear any cost or expense, pay any commitment or other fee, enter
into any definitive agreement, incur any other liability or obligation, make any other payment or agree to provide any indemnity in
connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time. In addition, nothing in this Section 6.11 shall
require any action that would conflict with or violate the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' organizational documents or any laws
or result in, prior to the Effective Time, the contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in, prior to the Effective
Time, a violation or breach of, or default under, any contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. In addition, if,
in connection with a marketing effort contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent reasonably requests the Company to file a
Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains material non-public information with respect to the Company,
which Parent reasonably desires to include in a customary offering memorandum for the Debt Financing, then the Company shall
discuss in good faith whether or not the Company shall file a Current Report on Form 8-K or similar document containing such
material non-public information. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective officers,
directors (with respect to any Subsidiary of the Company) or employees shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any

the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection therewith, including compliance by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives with its obligations under this Section 6.11. Nothing contained in this
Section 6.11 or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be an issuer or obligor with respect to the Debt
Financing prior to the Effective Time.

        (d)   Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that could reasonably be
expected to result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in the Financing Letters or in any definitive agreement relating to
the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the Company's obligations under Section 6.11(c),
none of the obtaining of the Financing or any permitted alternative financing, the completion of any issuance of securities
contemplated by the Financing, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries having or maintaining any available cash balances is a
condition to the Closing, and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Financing or any permitted alternative financing, the completion of any such issuance, or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries having or maintaining any available cash balances subject to the applicable conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and
Section 7.3.

        (e)   All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives
pursuant to clause (c) above shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that, upon notice to
the Company, Parent may provide such information to potential sources of capital and to rating agencies and prospective lenders and
investors during syndication and marketing of the Debt Financing (including any permitted alternative financing) subject to customary
confidentiality arrangements with such Persons regarding such information.

        6.12    Control of Operations.     Without in any way limiting any party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, (a) nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give the Parent or the Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's
operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' operations.

        6.13    Security Holder Litigation.     In the event that any litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby is brought by any stockholder of the Company or any holder of the Company's other securities against the Company
and/or its directors or officers, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with
respect to the status thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (but subject to the following sentence), the Company shall have
the right to control the defense and settlement of any litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions brought by any
stockholder of the Company or any holder of the Company's other securities against the Company and/or its directors or officers, provided
that the Company shall give the Parent the opportunity to participate, at the Parent's expense, in the defense of any such litigation and the
Company shall consider in good faith the Parent's advice with respect to such litigation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company shall not settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of Parent.

reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC within twenty (20) Business Days after the date hereof (subject to Parent's reasonable
cooperation in connection therewith) a proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, including the form of proxy

consider, among other matters, the adoption of this Agreement and (ii) set a record date for determining the stockholders entitled to
notice of and to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the
Exchange Act in connection therewith. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the
Company without providing the Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon which comments the Company will
consider for inclusion in good faith. The Company will advise the Parent promptly after it receives any oral or written request by the
SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information, and will promptly provide the Parent with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state securities
commission and a reasonable opportunity to participate in the responses thereto. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
information relating to the Company or the Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
the Company or the Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy
Statement would not contain any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall promptly be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under applicable law, disseminated to stockholders of the Company; provided that the
delivery of such notice and the filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by any party hereunder or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.

        (b)   As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Company's receipt of notice from the SEC that the SEC has completed
its review of the Proxy Statement (or, if the SEC does not inform the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement on or
before the 10th calendar day following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement pursuant to Rule 14a-6 under the Exchange Act,
as promptly as reasonably practicable following such 10th calendar day), the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval and, if applicable, the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith; provided,
however, that the Company Board shall be permitted to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance
with applicable law (but not beyond the Outside Date) (i) to the extent necessary to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with
outside counsel is reasonably likely to be necessary or appropriate under applicable law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company's stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, (ii) if there
are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meetings or (iii) on one occasion to allow reasonable additional time to solicit
additional proxies to the extent the Company Board or any committee thereof reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval. Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board
Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.1(b), the Company, through the Company Board, shall (A) recommend to its
stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and (B) include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

Section 6.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (ii) without limitation or modification to the restrictions set forth in Section 5.1, refrain
from taking actions to effect any internal reorganization to implement the Carveout Transactions without the prior written consent of the
Parent; provided that nothing set forth in this Section 6.15 shall require the Company to take any corporate action, to execute any document or
other instrument, or to incur any liability that is not conditioned upon or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time. Without
limitation of the Company's obligations set forth in Section 6.11, the Parties agree and acknowledge that (i) the Company's compliance or
failure to comply with this Section 6.15 shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the condition referred to in
Section 7.3(b) shall have been satisfied with respect to performance in all material respects with this Section 6.15, (ii) upon satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII and completion of the Marketing Period, the Closing will proceed in accordance with
Section 1.3 notwithstanding the status of the review, planning, preparation or implementation of any Carveout Transaction, (iii) Parent and
Merger Sub's sole remedy for the Company's breach of this Section 6.15 shall be specific performance (and the Company acknowledges and
agrees that such remedy shall be available against it) and (iv) no action taken by the Company prior to Closing at the request of the Parent
pursuant to a Carveout Transaction shall be a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant included in this Agreement.

        6.16    Repatriation.     Parent may periodically request from the Company, and the Company will provide (but not more often than
monthly), an estimate of the amount of cash that it believes could be repatriated by the Company as of a Closing Date estimated by Parent in
good faith, understanding that such amounts are only an estimate, that actual amounts may vary from such estimates and that the Company
shall not be liable for any such variances. Not less than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent may request in writing to the
Company (the "Repatriation Notice") that the Company and its wholly owned Subsidiaries use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate to
transfer in any jurisdiction located outside of the United States (the "Repatriation Jurisdictions") legally or contractually unrestricted cash
balances held in commercial bank accounts in the name of the Company or such wholly owned Subsidiary to accounts in the name of the
Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary located in the United States (the "Repatriation"; and "Repatriate" shall have a correlative meaning)
effective as of the Effective Time. The Repatriation Notice shall specify the Repatriation Jurisdictions that Parent would like the Company to
repatriate cash from and Parent's good faith estimate of the Closing Date. The Company will review the Repatriation Notice and send to
Parent, as promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof (and in any event within five (5) Business Days), a written response setting forth
the following information with respect each Repatriation Jurisdiction (the "Repatriation Response"): (a) the amount of cash in each
Repatriation Jurisdiction that the Company believes could be reasonably Repatriated, taking into account (i) Parent's estimate of the Closing
Date, (ii) the amount of cash reasonably needed in such Repatriation Jurisdiction to operate the business in the ordinary course and meet
working capital requirements in such Repatriation Jurisdiction, (iii) applicable law, including those relating to solvency, adequate surplus,
similar capital adequacy tests, corporate benefit, financial assistance, distributable reserves and directors' duties, and (iv) any estimated Taxes
or fees and expenses to be paid in such Repatriation Jurisdiction in connection with the Repatriation, (b) the estimated costs and expenses that
would be incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Repatriation, including estimated Taxes that would be payable
on such Repatriated amount and the estimated fees and expenses of counsel and accountants in connection with any such Repatriation
(collectively, the "Estimated Costs") and (c) the amount of time that the Company estimates it would take for the Repatriation to be completed
in each such Repatriation Jurisdiction identified in the Repatriation Notice; provided that, in each case it is understood that such amounts and
other information in any Repatriation Response are only estimates, that actual amounts and timing may vary from such estimates and that the
Company shall not be liable for any such variances. The Company shall not unreasonably deny a request for repatriation set forth in a
Repatriation Notice. Within five (5) Business Days following delivery of the Repatriation Response,

Parent shall notify the Company in writing whether or not Parent wishes for the Company to consummate as of the Effective Time any or all
of the Repatriations set forth in the Repatriation Response (including the amount of any such Repatriation, subject to increases or decreases of
such amounts by the Company as may be reasonable at the time of Repatriation based on the amount of unrestricted cash actually available at
such time) (the "Repatriation Confirmation") and if it requests any such Repatriation, confirming with respect to each such Repatriation,
(x) that it approves of the Company and its Subsidiaries taking the actions reasonably necessary in the Company's sole judgment to effect
such Repatriation and (y) that it approves of the Company incurring the Estimated Costs (and any additional costs as may be reasonably
incurred in connection with the Repatriation). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments, Taxes
(including loss of tax attributes) and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Repatriation, including any action taken in
accordance with this Section 6.16 and including the Estimated Costs (and any additional costs). Without limiting the generality of the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all Estimated Costs (and
any additional costs) actually incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with this Section 6.16. Without limitation of the
Company's obligations set forth in Section 6.11, the Parties agree and acknowledge that (1) the Company's compliance or failure to comply
with this Section 6.16 shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the condition referred to in Section 7.3(b) shall
have been satisfied with respect to performance in all material respects with this Section 6.16, (2) upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VII and completion of the Marketing Period, the Closing will proceed in accordance with Section 1.3 notwithstanding the
status of any Repatriation and (3) Parent and Merger Sub's sole remedy for the Company's breach of this Section 6.16 shall be specific
performance (and the Company acknowledges and agrees that such remedy shall be available against it). Nothing in this Section 6.16 shall
require any action that would conflict with or violate the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' organizational documents or any applicable
laws or result in, prior to the Effective Time, the contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in, prior to the Effective
Time, a violation or breach of, or default under, any contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

        (a)   Reference is made to each of (i) the 2.750% Senior Notes Due 2018 issued by the Company (the "2018 Notes") and (ii) the
4.375% Senior Notes Due 2023 issued by the Company (the "2023 Notes and, collectively with the 2018 Notes, the "Notes"; the
indenture governing the Notes being the "Indenture").

        (b)   At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation under any of the then outstanding Notes to comply with
all of the terms and conditions of the then outstanding Notes and the Indenture, including, to the extent required by the terms and
conditions of any of the then outstanding Notes or the Indenture, causing the Surviving Corporation under any series of Notes to
obtain and deliver officers' certificates and opinions of counsel stating that the Merger and the other Transactions comply with the
Indenture.

        (c)   At the request and expense of Parent, the Company shall promptly at a time reasonably requested by Parent, commence an
offer to purchase for any and all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes on price terms that are acceptable to
Parent and such other customary terms and conditions as are reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent to be consummated
substantially simultaneously with the Closing using funds provided by Parent (the "Debt Tender Offer") and Parent shall assist the
Company in connection therewith. The Company shall adopt any corporate authorizations that are reasonable and necessary for the

provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Tender Offer. The closing of the Debt Tender
Offer shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Tender
Offer to close on the Closing Date; provided that the consummation of the Debt Tender Offer with respect to any series of Notes shall
not be a condition to Closing. Concurrent with the Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms of the Debt Tender Offer, the
Surviving Corporation shall accept for purchase and purchase each series of Notes properly tendered and not properly withdrawn in
the Debt Tender Offer using funds provided by or at the direction of Parent. Parent hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or to
cause to be provided) immediately available funds to the Company for the full payment at the Effective Time of all Notes properly
tendered and not withdrawn to the extent required pursuant to the terms of the Debt Tender Offer.

        (d)   If reasonably requested by the Parent in writing, the Company shall, in accordance with the applicable redemption
provisions of the applicable series of Notes and the Indenture, (A) substantially simultaneous with, but in no event prior to, the
Effective Time issue a notice of optional redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes,

requested by the Parent to facilitate the satisfaction and discharge of such series of Notes pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge
provisions of the Indenture and the other provisions of the Indenture applicable thereto; provided that prior to the Company's being
required to take any of the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) above, the Parent shall have, or shall have caused to be, set aside
sufficient and immediately available funds to deliver to the Company to effect such redemption and satisfaction and discharge. The
redemption and satisfaction and discharge of any series of Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to collectively as the
"Discharge" of such series of Notes. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Discharge of any series of Notes identified to the Company by
Parent in writing at any time.

        (e)   Parent shall (or the Company, if directed by Parent, shall), at a time at or after the Effective Time selected by Parent,
commence a change of control offer to purchase all of the 2023 Notes (in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture) at the
price required pursuant to the Indenture using funds provided by Parent. The Company shall and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause its Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with such change of control offer
for the 2023 Notes. In accordance with the terms of the change of control offer for the 2023 Notes, the Surviving Corporation shall
accept for purchase and purchase each of the 2023 Notes properly tendered and not properly withdrawn in such change of control
offer using funds provided by or at the direction of Parent. Parent hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or to cause to be provided)
immediately available funds to the Company for the full payment all 2023 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn to the
extent required pursuant to the terms of such change of control offer.

2023 Notes or any Debt Tender Offer, including the offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal, and other related documents
(collectively, the "Offer Documents"), and provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to comment and make reasonable
changes to such documents. Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer
Documents. The Offer Documents (including all amendments or supplements) and all mailings to the holders of the Notes in
connection with any Debt Tender Offer or such change of control offer shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by, the
Company and Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion of any Debt Tender
Offer or change of control offer any

information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other, which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such
information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the Company to the holders of the Notes (which supplement or amendment and
dissemination may, at the reasonable direction of Parent after consultation with the Company, take the form of a filing of a Current
Report on Form 8-K). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.17(f), the Company shall comply with the
requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable law to the extent such laws are applicable in connection
with the any change of control offer for the 2023 Notes or any Debt Tender Offer and such compliance will not be deemed a breach
hereof.

        (g)   So long as the Company has sufficient immediately available funds for the full payment of the 2023 Notes validly tendered,
the Company shall waive any of the conditions to any Debt Tender Offer (other than that the Merger shall have been consummated
and that there shall be no final order, decree, judgment, injunction, ruling or other non-appealable action prohibiting consummation of
any Debt Tender Offer) as may be reasonably requested by Parent in writing and shall not, without the written consent of Parent,
waive any condition to any Debt Tender Offer or make any changes to any Debt Tender Offer or such change of control offer other
than as agreed between Parent and the Company.

        (h)   In connection with the change of control offer for the 2023 Notes or any Debt Tender Offer, Parent may select one or more
dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to
provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall enter into customary agreements (including indemnities) with such
parties so selected; provided that the Company shall not be responsible for the delivery of any legal opinions with respect thereto.
Parent shall pay the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in
connection with any Debt Tender Offer or such change of control offer upon the incurrence of such fees and out-of-pocket expenses.

        (i)    Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the Company's compliance with its
obligations under this Section 6.17, including all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by or on
behalf of the Company in connection with any Debt Tender Offer, Discharge or change of control offer made in respect of any series
of Notes (including any out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation or distribution of any Offer
Documents or other documents related thereto). Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Representatives from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or liabilities incurred by any of them in connection with any action taken by
them pursuant to this Section 6.17 with respect to any Debt Tender Offer, Discharge or change of control offer (in each case other than
as a result of the Company's fraud or willful misconduct); provided, however, that the Parent shall not have any obligation to
indemnify and hold harmless any such party or person to the extent such damages suffered or incurred are directly attributable to the
information provided by the Company for use in connection with such Debt Tender Offer, Discharge or change of control offer that is
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have contained a material misstatement or omission.

        10.9    Governing Law.     This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware; provided that, except as specifically set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of
the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect
to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of another
jurisdiction.

        10.10    Remedies.     

        (a)   Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Person will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Person, and the exercise by a
Person of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

        (b)   The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary relief (including any fees payable pursuant to
Section 8.3), even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required
of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement. Subject to the following sentence and Section 10.10(c), the parties acknowledge
and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 10.11 without
proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the
provisions set forth in Section 8.3 and 10.10(c) (i) are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result
from a breach of this Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party's right to
specific enforcement and (c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the
Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary herein, it
is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in
connection with enforcing Parent's obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the applicable Equity Funding Letter and to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.3 (but not the right of the Company to
such injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject in all events to the
requirements that (i) the Marketing Period has ended and the satisfaction, or express written waiver by Parent of all conditions
precedent to the obligations of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in in Sections 7.1 and 7.3 (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being satisfied at the
Closing) at the time when the Closing would have been required to occur pursuant to Section 1.3, but for the failure of the Equity
Financing to be funded, (ii) the Debt Financing (including any alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with
Section 6.11(b)) has been funded or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is or
were to be funded at the Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that (x) if specific performance
is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing were funded, then it would take such actions required of it by this Agreement
to cause the Closing to occur and (y) it stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger. The parties hereto agree not to assert
that a remedy of specific enforcement is contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert

that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 10.10(b) shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

        (c)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

          (i)  in the event that the Company shall terminate this Agreement in circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is
owed pursuant to Section 8.3(c), then, the Company's right to receive payment of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 8.3(c) shall, together with any indemnification for or reimbursement of any applicable expenses pursuant to
Section 6.11(c) , 6.15, 6.16, 6.17 or 8.3(e), be the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by the Company, the Company Related Parties or any other Person arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing Letters or the Limited Guarantee, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (and the
abandonment or termination hereof or thereof), any breach (including any Willful Breach) or failure to perform hereunder or
thereunder, the failure of the Merger or the other Transactions to be consummated, or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and, upon payment of such amount, neither the Company, any Company Related Party nor any other Person shall
be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub, any Guarantor, the Financing
Sources or any of their respective representatives (including any investment banker, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants
or other advisors) or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their or their Affiliates' respective direct or indirect, former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, equityholders, securityholders, financing sources, managers,
members, directors, officers, representatives, employees, controlling persons, agents or assignees (collectively, the "Parent
Related Parties") for any loss or damage arising out of or in connection with any breach (including any Willful Breach) or
failure to perform under this Agreement, the Financing Letters or the Limited Guarantee, any of the Transactions (or the
abandonment or termination thereof), the failure of the Merger or the other Transactions to be consummated or any matters
forming the basis for such termination (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement); provided
that nothing in this Section 10.10(c) shall limit the rights of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
under the Confidentiality Agreement or to be indemnified and reimbursed for expenses in accordance with Section 6.11(c),
6.15, 6.16, 6.17 or 8.3(e). For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, upon
payment to the Company of such Parent Termination Fee, none of Parent or the Parent Related Parties or any of their
representatives, including any investment banker, financial advisor, any Debt Financing Source, attorney, accountant or other
advisor, agent, representative or affiliate shall have any further liability or obligation to the Company or any Company Related
Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;

         (ii)  in the event that Parent or its designee shall become entitled to receive full payment of the Company Termination
Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b), then Parent's right to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 8.3(b) shall, together with any reimbursement of applicable expenses pursuant to Section 8.3(e), be the sole and
exclusive remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, the Parent Related Parties or
any other Person arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions (and the abandonment or termination
thereof) any breach (including any Willful Breach) or failure to perform hereunder, the failure of the Merger or

the other Transactions to be consummated, or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and, upon payment of such
amount, none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain
any claim, action or proceeding against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective direct or indirect, former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, financing sources, representatives, employees,
controlling persons, agents or Affiliates or any other Person claiming by, through or for the benefit of the Company
(collectively, "Company Related Parties") arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (including any Willful Breach),
any of the Transactions, the failure of the Merger or the other Transactions to be consummated or any matters forming the
basis for such termination; provided that nothing in this Section 10.10(c) shall limit the rights of the Parent and any of its
applicable Representatives under the Confidentiality Agreement or to be indemnified and reimbursed for expenses in
accordance with Section 8.3(e); and

        (iii)  in connection with any loss suffered by the Company or any Company Related Party arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement, the Financing Letters or the Limited Guarantees and the Transactions, including as a result of the failure
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to be consummated or for a breach (including Willful Breach) or failure
to perform hereunder or otherwise (other than in the circumstances in which the Company is entitled to receive the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(c)) the Company agrees, on behalf of itself and the Company Related Parties, that the
maximum aggregate monetary liability of Parent and the Parent Related Parties, if any, shall be limited to the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee, and in no event shall the Company or any Company Related Party seek or be entitled to recover from
Parent or any Parent Related Parties, and the Company on behalf of itself and the Company Related Parties hereby irrevocably
waives and relinquishes any right to seek or recover, any monetary damages in excess of such amount, including through
Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent Related Party or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
partnership or limited liability company veil, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any applicable law, through a claim based in tort, contract or otherwise (except that Parent shall be obligated to the
Company under the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.3(e) and for any of its expense reimbursement and indemnification
obligations contained in Sections 6.11(c), 6.15, 6.16 and 6.17).

        (iv)  In connection with any loss suffered by any Parent Related Party as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, other than in the circumstances in which Parent is
entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b), Parent agrees, on behalf of itself and the Parent
Related Parties, that the maximum aggregate monetary liability of the Company and the Company Related Parties, if any, shall
be limited to the amount of the Company Termination Fee, and in no event shall Parent or any Parent Related Party seek or be
entitled to recover from the Company or any Company Related Parties, and Parent on behalf of itself and the Parent Related
Parties hereby irrevocably waives and relinquishes any right to seek or recover, any monetary damages in excess of such
amount (except that the Company shall be obligated to the Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 8.3(e)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent acknowledges and agress that it shall not be entitled to monetary damages for any
breach of Section 6.15 or Section 6.16 by the Company and that its sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of Section 6.15
or Section 6.16 by the Company shall be specific performance (and the Company acknowledges and agrees that such remedy
shall be available against it).

For the avoidance of doubt, while each of the Company and Parent may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with
Section 10.10(b) and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, under Section 8.3(b) or
Section 8.3(c), respectively, or the recovery of monetary damages subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10.10(c)(iii) or
Section 10.10(c)(iv), under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both (1) a grant of specific
performance of the Equity Financing to be funded and/or that results in a Closing and consummation of the Transactions and (2) any money
damages, including monetary damages in lieu of specific performance and all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company
Termination Fee, as applicable, and in no event shall the Company Related Parties or the Parent Related Parties be entitled to receive any
damages whatsoever if the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, is paid (except for any obligations arising
under the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.3(e), Section 6.11(c) , Section 6.15, Section 6.16 and Section 6.17). The parties acknowledge
and agree that the fact that the parties have agreed to this Section 10.10(c) shall not be deemed to affect any party's right to specific
performance under Section 10.10(b) (subject to the limitations set forth therein). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Debt Financing Source
shall be liable for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages (including, without limitation, any loss of profits, business or
anticipated savings) in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter, this Agreement, the Transactions, or with respect to any activities
related to the Debt Financing.

        10.11    Submission to Jurisdiction.     Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the

of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives
any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security
that might be required of any other Person with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering
a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.2. Nothing in
this Section 10.11, however, shall affect the right of any Person to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not, and will not permit its Affiliates to, bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources and their respective former, current or future affiliates and their former, current or future
general or limited partners, shareholders, directors, officers, managers, employees, members, agents, representatives, controlling persons,
advisors or attorneys and any heirs, successors or assigns of any of the foregoing in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, including with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letters and any transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York or the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, located in the Borough of Manhattan in
the City of New York or, in either case, any appellate court thereof, and agree that the waiver of jury trial set forth in Section 10.12 hereof
shall be applicable to any such proceeding.

        10.12    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.     EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH
MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE

Annex B 

June 28, 2017

Board of Directors
Staples, Inc.
500 Staples Dr.
Framingham, MA 01702

Members of the Board of Directors:

        We understand that Staples, Inc. (the "Company") intends to enter into a transaction (the "Proposed Transaction") with Arch Parent Inc.
("Parent") and Arch Merger Sub Inc. ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the
Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the "Merger"), and (ii) each share of common stock, par value $0.0006, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement (as defined below)), other than shares held in treasury or
held by any subsidiary of the Company, the Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent or as to which dissenters' rights have been
perfected (collectively, the "Excluded Shares"), will be converted into the right to receive $10.25 per share in cash (the "Merger
Consideration"). The terms and conditions of the Proposed Transaction are set forth in more detail in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"Agreement") to be dated as of June 28, 2017 by and among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub. The summary of the Proposed Transaction
set forth above is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Agreement.

        We have been requested by the Board of Directors of the Company to render our opinion with respect to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to the Company's stockholders (other than the holders of Excluded Shares) of the Merger Consideration to be offered to such
stockholders in the Proposed Transaction. We have not been requested to opine as to, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the
Company's underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the Proposed Transaction or the likelihood of consummation of the
Proposed Transaction. In addition, we express no opinion on, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the amount or
the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Proposed Transaction, or any class of such
persons, relative to the Merger Consideration to be offered to the stockholders of the Company in the Proposed Transaction. Our opinion does
not address the relative merits of the Proposed Transaction as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which the Company
might engage.

        In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed and analyzed: (1) a draft of the Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2017 and the specific terms of

indications of interest from third parties with respect to a sale of the Company; and (8) published estimates of independent research analysts
with respect to the future financial performance and price targets for the Company. In addition, we have had discussions with the management
of the Company concerning its business, operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition and prospects and have undertaken such other
studies, analyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.

        In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used
by us without any independent verification of such information (and have not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent
verification of such information) and have further relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of
any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the financial projections of the
Company, upon the advice of the Company, we have assumed that such projections have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company
and that the Company will perform substantially in accordance with such projections. We assume no responsibility for and we express no
view as to any such projections or estimates or the assumptions on which they are based. In arriving at our opinion, we have not conducted a
physical inspection of the properties and facilities of the Company and have not made or obtained any evaluations or appraisals of the assets
or liabilities of the Company. Our opinion necessarily is based upon market, economic and other conditions as they exist on, and can be
evaluated as of, the date of this letter. We assume no responsibility for updating or revising our opinion based on events or circumstances that
may occur after the date of this letter.

        We have assumed that the executed Agreement will conform in all material respects to the last draft reviewed by us. In addition, we have
assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement and all agreements related thereto. We have also
assumed, upon the advice of the Company, that all material governmental, regulatory and third party approvals, consents and releases for the
Proposed Transaction will be obtained within the constraints contemplated by the Agreement and that the Proposed Transaction will be
consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or
agreement thereof. We understand that Parent has received draft equity commitment letters from Sycamore Partners II, L.P. ("Sycamore
Partners"), an affiliate of the Parent, NB Arch LP ("Neuberger"), and affiliates of HarbourVest Partners, L.P. ("Harbourvest" and, together
with Neuberger, the "Co-Investors"), each dated June 28, 2017, as applicable, and draft debt commitment letters from certain lenders dated
June 28, 2017. We express no opinion with respect to the terms of the equity or debt commitment letters or the availability of the financing
contemplated thereby. We do not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the Proposed Transaction,
nor does our opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which we understand that the Company has obtained such
advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion as of the date hereof that, from a financial point of view, the Merger
Consideration to be offered to the stockholders of the Company (other than the holders of Excluded Shares) in the Proposed Transaction is
fair to such stockholders.

        We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Proposed Transaction and will receive fees for our services a
portion of which is payable upon rendering this opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the
Proposed Transaction. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse a portion of our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities that
may arise out of our engagement. We have performed various investment banking services for the Company in the past, and expect to perform
such services in the future, and have received, and expect to receive, customary fees for such services. Specifically, in the past two years, we

performed any investment banking services for HarbourVest for which we have received any fees. In the future we and our affiliates may
provide investment banking services for HarbourVest and its affiliates or portfolio companies and may receive customary fees for rendering
such services.

Annex C 

June 28, 2017

Board of Directors
Staples, Inc.
500 Staples Drive
Framingham, MA 01702

Members of the Board:

        We understand that Staples, Inc. ("Staples" or the "Company"), Arch Parent Inc. (the "Buyer") and Arch Merger Sub Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Buyer ("Acquisition Sub"), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the
draft dated June 28, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), which provides, among other things, for the merger (the "Merger") of Acquisition Sub
with and into the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer, and each outstanding
share of common stock, par value $0.0006 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") other than shares held in treasury, or
held by any subsidiary of the Company, the Buyer, Acquisition Sub or any other affiliate of the Buyer, or as to which dissenters' rights have
been perfected (collectively, the "Excluded Shares"), will be converted into the right to receive $10.25 per share in cash (the "Consideration").
The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

        You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock
(other than holders of Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of
the Company Common Stock.

        For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:

1) Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company; 

2) Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company; 

3) Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company; 

4) Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior executives of
the Company; 

5) Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock; 

6) Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the Company Common Stock with
that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the Company and their securities; 

7) Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions; 

8) Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and the Buyer and their legal
advisor; 

9) Reviewed the Merger Agreement, the draft equity commitment letters from an affiliate of the Buyer, NB Arch LP ("Neuberger
Berman"), and Harbourvest Partners, L.P. (together with Neuberger Berman, the "Co-Investors"), each dated June 28, 2017,
and the draft debt commitment letters from certain lenders dated June 28, 2017 (collectively, the "Financing Letters") and
certain related documents; and

10) Performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.

        We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly
available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the
financial projections, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial performance of the Company. In addition, we have assumed that the
Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any
terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the Buyer will obtain equity and debt financing in accordance with the terms
indicated in the Financing Letters and express no opinion with respect to the terms of the Financing Letters or the availability of the financing
contemplated thereby, and that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to us.
Morgan Stanley has assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents
required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect
on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We are not legal, tax or regulatory advisors. We are financial
advisors only and have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors
with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any of the Company's officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the transaction. We have not made any independent valuation or
appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is
necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date
hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

        We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will receive a fee for
our services, a portion of which is contingent on the delivery of this financial opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon
the closing of the Merger. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we have provided financial advisory and financing services to the
Company, the Co-Investors and their respective affiliates and have received fees in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may also
seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Buyer, the Company, the Co-Investors and their respective affiliates in the
future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.

        Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual
wealth management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign
exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory
services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold
long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts
of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the Buyer and its affiliates, the Co-Investors and their respective affiliates, the
Company, or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in this transaction, or any related derivative instrument.
In addition, Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors or officers, including individuals working with the Company in connection with this
transaction, may have committed and may commit in the future to invest in private equity funds managed by affiliates of the Buyer or any of
the Co-Investors.

        This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with our
customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other purpose
or disclosed without our prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be included in its entirety in any filing the Company is
required to make with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with this transaction if such inclusion is required by applicable
law. In addition, Morgan Stanley expresses no opinion or recommendation as to how the shareholders of the Company should vote at the
shareholders' meeting to be held in connection with the Merger.

        Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Consideration to be received by the holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares) pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial
point of view to such holders of shares of the Company Common Stock.

Annex D 

SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE 

§ 262 Appraisal rights 

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the
fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this
section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is
ordinarily meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an
interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3)
of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to
determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further
provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the
merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or
consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in
respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either
listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and
b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267
of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior

to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal
rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the words
"merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or "surviving or
resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which
the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of
incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e) and (g) of this section,
shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders
who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this
title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights
are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1
of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a
written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of
the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy
or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so
by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving
or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has
not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days
thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal
rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series
of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations
is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to
appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h)
of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of
mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such
demand will be

sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand
the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation
notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the
effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such
holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days
following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the
consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second
notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's
shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation
that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts
stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in
advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on
or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the
notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the
notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder
who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such
stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date
of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof,
upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement
setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal
have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within
10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days
after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in
this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly
verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements
as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or
resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court,
shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting
corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein

stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail
and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold
stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to
which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of
such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for
such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with
the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall
determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as
provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded
quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the
period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue
thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting
corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the
appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by
the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock
to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is
not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated
stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates
representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such
surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal

proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in
subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on
the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger
or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this
section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an
appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as
provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an
appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided,
however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or
consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted
had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting
corporation.
