COTIVITI HOLDINGS, INC.
ONE GLENLAKE PARKWAY, SUITE 1400, ATLANTA, GA 30328

July 23, 2018

To Our Stockholders:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the stockholders (the "Special Meeting") of Cotiviti Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Cotiviti," the "Company,"
"we," "us" or "our"), to be held on August 24, 2018, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time. The Special Meeting will be a completely virtual meeting, which will be conducted via live
webcast. You will be able to attend the Special Meeting online and submit your questions during the meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/COTV2018SM.

On June 19, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement") with Verscend Technologies, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Verscend"), and Rey Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend ("Merger Sub"). The Merger Agreement
provides that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Cotiviti (the "Merger"), with
Cotiviti continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend.

At the Special Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the Merger (the "Merger Proposal"). The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Cotiviti common stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of the close of
business on July 18, 2018, the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting (the "Record Date"), is required to approve the Merger
Proposal.

At the Special Meeting, you will also be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, on an advisory non-binding basis, the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to Cotiviti's named executive officers in connection with the Merger (the "Executive Compensation Proposal"), and to consider and vote on a proposal to
approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
approve the Merger Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting (the "Adjournment Proposal").

If the Merger is consummated, you will be entitled to receive $44.75 in cash (the "Merger Consideration"), without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each
share of Cotiviti common stock that you own (unless you do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal and you are entitled to demand and have properly made a demand for
appraisal and do not thereafter fail to perfect, or do not effectively withdraw or otherwise lose your right to appraisal under Delaware law with respect to such shares). The
Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 12.2% over the Cotiviti common stock closing price of $39.89 per share on June 18, 2018, the last trading day
before the public announcement that Cotiviti entered into the Merger Agreement, and a premium of approximately 31.8% over the Cotiviti common stock closing price of
$33.95 per share on June 4, 2018 (the last day before news reports suggested that the Company was engaged in a transaction process).

The Board of Directors of Cotiviti (the "Board") has unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Cotiviti and its stockholders and has unanimously approved the



10/1/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1657197/000104746918005113/a2236261zdefm14a.htm

Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. The Board unanimously recommends that Cotiviti stockholders vote "FOR"
the Merger Proposal. In addition, the Board unanimously recommends that Cotiviti stockholders vote "FOR" the Executive Compensation Proposal and "FOR"
the Adjournment Proposal.

On June 19, 2018, certain direct and indirect stockholders of Cotiviti representing ownership of approximately 44% of the outstanding shares of Cotiviti common stock as of
the date of the Merger Agreement, entered into a voting and support agreement with Verscend pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions
therein, such stockholders agreed to vote their shares of Cotiviti common stock in favor of the Merger Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.

As an analytics-driven technology services company, we are excited to embrace the latest technology for our Special Meeting. We believe that hosting a virtual meeting
enables increased stockholder attendance and improves communications and participation by providing access to stockholders from any location around the world.

The Notice of Meeting and Proxy Statement on the following pages further describe the matters to be presented at the Special Meeting and provide details regarding how to
attend the meeting online. We encourage you to read the accompanying proxy statement and its appendices, including the Merger Agreement, carefully and in their entirety.
You may also obtain more information about Cotiviti from documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.

Whether or not you attend the Special Meeting, it is important that your shares be represented and voted at the Special Meeting. Therefore, I urge you to promptly
vote and submit your proxy by phone, via the Internet, or, if you received paper copies of these materials, by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the
enclosed envelope, which requires no postage if mailed in the United States. Instructions on how to vote your shares are included in the accompanying proxy statement and
proxy card. If you decide to attend the Special Meeting, you will be able to vote online at the Special Meeting even if you have previously submitted your proxy, as your proxy
is revocable at your option.

Thank you for your support.

Sincerely,

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved of the transactions described in this
document, including the Merger, or determined if the information contained in this document is accurate or adequate. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offense.

The accompanying proxy statement is dated July 23, 2018 and, together with the enclosed form of proxy card, is first being mailed to stockholders of Cotiviti
Holdings, Inc. on or about July 23, 2018.

The special meeting of the stockholders (the "Special Meeting") of Cotiviti Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Cotiviti," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our"), will be held at
9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on August 24, 2018, for the following purposes:

• To consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), dated
June 19, 2018, by and among the Company, Verscend Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Verscend"), and Rey Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend ("Merger Sub"), and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger of Merger Sub

• To consider and vote on a proposal to approve, on an advisory non-binding basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Cotiviti's named
executive officers in connection with the Merger (the "Executive Compensation Proposal"); and 

• To consider and vote on a proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting (the "Adjournment Proposal").

In addition, we will consider the transaction of any other business properly brought at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. However, under the
Merger Agreement, the Merger Proposal will be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable law to be voted on by the Company's
stockholders in connection with the Merger Proposal) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Special Meeting.

The Special Meeting will be held online at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/COTV2018SM. The Special Meeting may be continued or adjourned from time to time without
notice other than by announcement at the Special Meeting. Any action on the items of business described above may be considered at the Special Meeting at the time and
on the date specified above or at any time and date to which the Special Meeting may be properly adjourned or postponed.

Holders of record of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), at the close of business on July 18, 2018 (the "Record Date") are entitled to notice
of and to vote at the Special Meeting or any continuation, postponement or adjournment of the Special Meeting by visiting
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/COTV2018SM.

and, during the ten days preceding the Special Meeting, at our principal executive offices at One Glenlake Parkway, Suite 1400, Atlanta, GA 30328.

It is important that your shares be represented regardless of the number of shares you may hold. Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting, we urge you to vote
your shares via the toll-free telephone number or over the Internet as described in the enclosed proxy materials. If you received a copy of the proxy card by mail, you may
sign, date and mail the proxy card in the enclosed return envelope. Promptly voting your shares will ensure the presence of a quorum at the Special Meeting and will save us
the expense of further solicitation. Submitting your proxy now will not prevent you from voting your shares online at the Special Meeting if you desire to do so, as your proxy is
revocable at your option.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of the close of business on the Record Date is
required to approve the Merger Proposal. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast (excluding abstentions) at the Special Meeting is required to approve the
Executive Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.

The failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote electronically at the Special
Meeting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal, but will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal. If you hold your shares in "street name," the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Common Stock will result in a
"broker non-vote" of such shares and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal but will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation
Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal but will
not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

The presence at the Special Meeting, by remote communication or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding and
entitled to vote as of the close of business on the Record Date will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the meeting. Abstentions, if any, will be counted as
present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be counted as present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum.

Under Delaware law, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of our Common Stock
as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is consummated, but only if they submit a written demand for such an appraisal before the vote on the Merger
Proposal and comply with the other Delaware law procedures explained in the accompanying proxy statement.

You may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote at the Special Meeting by following the procedures outlined in the accompanying proxy statement.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote:

1. "FOR" the Merger Proposal; 

2. "FOR" the Executive Compensation Proposal; and 

3. "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal.

By Order of the Board of Directors,

Jonathan Olefson
Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary

Cotiviti (the "Merger"), with Cotiviti continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend (the "Merger Proposal"); 

• To consider and vote on a proposal to approve, on an advisory non-binding basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Cotiviti's named
executive officers in connection with the Merger (the "Executive Compensation Proposal"); and 

• To consider and vote on a proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting (the "Adjournment Proposal").

In addition, we will consider the transaction of any other business properly brought at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. However, under the
Merger Agreement, the Merger Proposal will be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable law to be voted on by the Company's
stockholders in connection with the Merger Proposal) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Special Meeting.

We know of no other business that will be presented at the Special Meeting. If any other matter properly comes before the stockholders for a vote at the Special Meeting,
however, the proxy holders named on the Company's proxy card will vote your shares in accordance with their best judgment.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE BOARD 

The Board recommends that you vote your shares as indicated below. If you return a properly completed proxy card, or vote your shares by telephone or Internet, your shares
of Common Stock will be voted on your behalf as you direct. If not otherwise specified, the shares of Common Stock represented by the proxies will be voted at the discretion
of the proxy holders.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote:

• "FOR" the Merger Proposal; 

• "FOR" the Executive Compensation Proposal; and 

• "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal.

INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PROXY STATEMENT 

Why you received this Proxy Statement. You received these proxy materials because the Board is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the Special Meeting. As a
stockholder, you are invited to participate in the Special Meeting via live webcast and to vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement. This Proxy Statement
includes information that we are required to provide to you under the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and that is designed to
assist you in voting your shares.

Householding. The SEC's rules permit us to deliver a single set of proxy materials to one address shared by two or more of our stockholders. This delivery method is
referred to as "householding" and can result in significant cost savings. To take advantage of this opportunity, we have delivered only one set of proxy materials to multiple
stockholders who share an address, unless we received contrary instructions from the impacted stockholders prior to the mailing date. We agree to deliver promptly, upon
written or oral request, a separate copy of the proxy materials, as requested, to any stockholder at the shared address to which a single copy of those documents was
delivered. Alternatively, stockholders sharing an address who are receiving multiple copies of the proxy materials may request to receive a single copy of such materials in the
future. Instructions for making these requests are provided below under "Questions and Answers about the Special Meeting and Merger."

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND MERGER

The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions you may have regarding the Special Meeting, the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder
of Cotiviti. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the appendices to this proxy statement and the documents incorporated
by reference or referred to in this proxy statement, which you should read carefully and in their entirety.

WHY AM I RECEIVING THESE PROXY MATERIALS? 

On June 19, 2018, Cotiviti entered into the Merger Agreement with Verscend and Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Cotiviti, which we refer to as the Merger, with Cotiviti continuing as the surviving
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend. Cotiviti is holding the Special Meeting of its stockholders in order to obtain stockholder approval of the Merger
Proposal, the Executive Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. We cannot complete the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement unless the Merger Proposal is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote as
of the close of business on the Record Date.

This proxy statement includes important information about the Merger and the Special Meeting. Cotiviti stockholders should read this information carefully and in its entirety. A
copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement.

Your vote is very important—we urge you to submit your proxy as soon as possible. Please follow the instructions set forth on the enclosed proxy card (or voting
instruction form provided by the record holder if your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee).

WHAT IS THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION? 

The proposed transaction is the acquisition of Cotiviti by Verscend through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Cotiviti, with Cotiviti continuing as the surviving corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend. Following the date and time the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such
later date and time as Cotiviti and Verscend may agree and specify in the certificate of merger) (the "Effective Time"), Cotiviti will be privately held as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Verscend. If the Merger is consummated, each share of Common Stock (other than shares owned by stockholders who did not vote in favor of the Merger
Proposal and who are entitled to demand and have properly made a demand for appraisal and do not thereafter fail to perfect, or do not effectively withdraw, or otherwise lose
their appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") ("Dissenting Shares")) will automatically be
cancelled and you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation or Verscend.

WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IF THE MERGER IS CONSUMMATED? 

Upon consummation of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive $44.75 in cash (the "Merger Consideration"), without interest, and less any applicable withholding taxes, for
each share of Common Stock that you own, unless you do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal and you are entitled to demand and have properly made a demand for
appraisal and do not thereafter fail to perfect, or do not effectively withdraw or otherwise lose your right to appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL with

respect to such shares. You will not be entitled to receive shares in the surviving corporation or in Verscend as a result of the Merger.

HOW DOES THE MERGER CONSIDERATION COMPARE TO THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND AS OF A RECENT TRADING DATE? 

The Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 12.2% over the closing price of our Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange of $39.89 per share
on June 18, 2018, the last trading day before the public announcement that Cotiviti entered into the Merger Agreement, and a premium of approximately 31.8% over the
closing price of our Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange of $33.95 per share on June 4, 2018 (the last day before news reports suggested that the Company
was engaged in a transaction process). On July 20, 2018, the last practicable day before the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price of our Common Stock on the
New York Stock Exchange was $44.41 per share. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for our Common Stock.

WHAT FACTORS DID THE BOARD CONSIDER IN DECIDING TO ENTER INTO THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND RECOMMENDING THE APPROVAL OF THE
MERGER PROPOSAL, THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL AND ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL? 

In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and to recommend our stockholders approve the
Merger Proposal, the Executive Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, the Board consulted with our management, as well as our legal and financial
advisors, and considered the terms of the proposed Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, as well as other alternatives. For a
more detailed description of these factors, see the section entitled "The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger" of this proxy statement.

WHAT AM I BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON AT THE SPECIAL MEETING? 

• To adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, which we refer to as the Merger Proposal; 

• To approve, on an advisory non-binding basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Cotiviti's named executive officers in connection with
the Merger, which we refer to as the Executive Compensation Proposal; and 

• To approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting, which we refer to as the Adjournment Proposal.

WHO IS ENTITLED TO VOTE AT THE SPECIAL MEETING? 

Stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 18, 2018 (the Record Date for the Special Meeting) are entitled to cast one vote per share of Common Stock on all
items being voted on at the Special Meeting. You may vote all shares owned by you as of that time, including (a) shares held directly in your name as the stockholder of
record, and (b) shares held for you as the beneficial owner through a bank, broker or other nominee. At the close of business on the Record Date, there were 94,037,966
shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, comprising 93,781,958 shares of

Common Stock issued and outstanding and 256,008 contingently issuable restricted shares of Common Stock outstanding.

WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE PROPOSAL TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT? 

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote is required to approve the Merger Proposal.

The failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote electronically at the Special
Meeting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal, but will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment
Proposal. If you hold your shares in "street name," the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Common Stock will result in a
"broker non-vote" of such shares and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal, but will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation
Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal, but
will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

Pursuant to a voting and support agreement entered into on June 19, 2018 with Verscend (the "Voting Agreement"), certain stockholders of Cotiviti agreed, subject to certain
conditions, among other things, to vote a total of 41,433,699 shares of our Common Stock, or approximately 44% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting as of the Record Date, "FOR" the Merger Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal and against any alternative proposal (including an Acquisition
Proposal, as defined in the Merger Agreement and described in this proxy statement) or any other action, agreement or transaction intended to impede or interfere with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the performance of the stockholders under the Voting Agreement.

WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL AND THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL? 

The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast (excluding abstentions) at the Special Meeting is required to approve the Executive Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal.

The failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote electronically at the Special
Meeting will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your shares in "street name," the failure to instruct your
bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares will result in a broker non-vote and will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

WHAT IS AN ABSTENTION AND HOW WILL ABSTENTIONS BE TREATED? 

An "abstention" represents a stockholder's affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. Abstentions are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of
determining a quorum at the Special Meeting. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal,
but will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

Table of Contents

WHAT ARE BROKER NON-VOTES AND DO THEY COUNT FOR DETERMINING A QUORUM? 

Generally, broker non-votes occur when shares held by a broker in "street name" for a beneficial owner are not voted with respect to a particular proposal because the broker
(1) has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and (2) lacks discretionary voting power to vote those shares. A broker is entitled to vote shares held for a
beneficial owner on routine matters without instructions from the beneficial owner of those shares. On the other hand, absent instructions from the beneficial owner of such
shares, a broker is not entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial owner on non-routine matters.

Broker non-votes will not be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum at the Special Meeting. Additionally, broker non-votes will have the
same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal, but will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

WHAT IS A QUORUM AND HOW MANY SHARES ARE NEEDED TO CONSTITUTE QUORUM? 

A quorum must be present at the Special Meeting for any business to be conducted. The presence at the Special Meeting, by remote communication or represented by proxy,
of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the Record Date will constitute a quorum. If a quorum is not present
at the scheduled time of the Special Meeting, the chairperson of the Special Meeting may adjourn the Special Meeting.

If you submit a signed proxy card or grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (regardless of whether you indicate how you wish to vote), your shares of
Common Stock will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If you hold your shares in "street name," the failure to instruct your bank, broker or
other nominee on how to vote your shares of Common Stock will result in a broker non-vote and such shares will not be counted for purposes of determining the presence of
a quorum. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.

HOW DOES THE BOARD RECOMMEND THAT I VOTE? 

The Board, after considering the various factors described under the section entitled "The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger" of this proxy
statement, unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of Cotiviti and its stockholders, and directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to our stockholders for their adoption.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal, "FOR" the Executive Compensation Proposal and "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal.

HOW DO I VOTE? 

Even if you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting online, we recommend that you vote by proxy as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not
to participate in the Special Meeting.

There are three ways to submit your proxy:

Internet and telephone voting facilities will be available 24 hours a day and will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on August 23, 2018.

You can also vote by attending the virtual Special Meeting online and voting electronically. You will need the 16-digit control number included on your proxy card or on the
instructions that accompanied your proxy materials. This control number is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of Common Stock and to confirm
that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for
voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as telephone and Internet access charges for which you will be
responsible.

Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of Common Stock by proxy as soon as possible.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING A "RECORD HOLDER" AND HOLDING SHARES IN "STREET NAME" AS A BENEFICIAL OWNER? 

A record holder holds shares in his or her own name, and such shares are registered with our transfer agent, AST. Shares held in "street name" means that the shares are
held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee on a person's behalf. If your shares are held in "street name" you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares.
As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You may also vote your shares electronically during the Special Meeting.
Most of our stockholders are beneficial owners who hold their shares in street name rather than directly in their own name.

nominee) living in the United States or Canada and who have received a voting instruction card by mail may vote by phone by

Table of Contents

AM I ENTITLED TO VOTE IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME"? 

Yes. If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held in street name you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares, and the
nominee is required to vote your shares in accordance with your instructions. You may also vote your shares electronically during the Special Meeting by attending the virtual
Special Meeting online and voting your shares at that time.

WILL MY SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HELD IN "STREET NAME" OR ANOTHER FORM OF RECORD OWNERSHIP BE COMBINED FOR VOTING PURPOSES
WITH SHARES I HOLD AS THE STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD? 

No. Because any shares of Common Stock you may hold in "street name" will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares of Common Stock you hold as
the stockholder of record, any shares of Common Stock held in "street name" will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of Common Stock you hold as the
stockholder of record. Similarly, if you own shares of Common Stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a
minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of Common Stock because they are held in a different form of record
ownership. Shares of Common Stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares of Common Stock held in an
individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.

IF I HOLD MY SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN "STREET NAME," WILL MY BROKER, TRUSTEE OR OTHER NOMINEE VOTE MY SHARES FOR ME ON THE
PROPOSALS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE SPECIAL MEETING? 

Not without your direction. Your bank, broker or other nominee is only permitted to vote your shares of Common Stock on "non-routine" proposals if you instruct such nominee
on how to vote. Under applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, trustees or other nominees only have the discretion to vote your shares on routine matters if you do not
instruct such nominee on how to vote your shares with respect to such matters. Each of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, and therefore brokers,
trustees and other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee
on how you wish to vote your shares.

You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to instruct them, as applicable, to vote your shares of Common Stock. Without such
instructions, a broker non-vote will result, and your shares will not be voted at the Special Meeting. A broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
Merger Proposal, but will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

WHAT HAPPENS IF I DO NOT VOTE? 

The required vote to approve the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of the close of business on
the Record Date, not just the shares that are voted at the Special Meeting. If you do not vote, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal.

The required vote to approve each of the Executive Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal is based on the total number of shares that are voted at the
Special Meeting. As a result, if you do not vote, it will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

Table of Contents

CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY SIGNED PROXY CARD OR OTHERWISE SUBMITTED MY VOTE BY PROXY? 

Yes. If you are the stockholder of record, you may change your vote by: (1) granting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy);
(2) providing a written notice of revocation to the Secretary at our offices at Cotiviti Holdings, Inc., One Glenlake Parkway, Suite 1400, Atlanta, GA 30328, prior to your shares
being voted at the Special Meeting; or (3) attending the virtual Special Meeting online and voting your shares electronically during the Special Meeting. Participation in the
Special Meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically make that request or affirmatively vote your shares at the Special Meeting.

For shares you hold beneficially in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your bank, broker or
other nominee, or by attending the virtual Special Meeting online and electronically voting your shares during the Special Meeting.

WHAT IS THE DEADLINE FOR VOTING MY SHARES? 

If you hold shares as the stockholder of record, your vote must be received before the polls close during the Special Meeting. Internet and telephone voting by proxy will close
at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on August 23, 2018, the day before the Special Meeting.

If you are the beneficial owner of shares held through a bank, broker or other nominee, please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, trustee or nominee.

WHAT IS A PROXY? 

A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a "proxy," to vote your shares of Common Stock. The written document describing the matters to be
considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a "proxy statement." The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of Common Stock is called a
"proxy card." The Board has designated J. Douglas Williams, Bradley Ferguson and Jonathan Olefson, each of them with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special
Meeting.

IF A STOCKHOLDER GIVES A PROXY, HOW ARE THE SHARES VOTED? 

Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, known as your proxies, will vote your shares in the way that you indicate.
When completing the Internet or telephone process, or when filling out your proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted "FOR" or "AGAINST" or to
abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.

If you properly submit a proxy but do not indicate how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted "FOR"
each of the Merger Proposal, the Executive Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, in accordance with the recommendations of the Board.

IS MY VOTE CONFIDENTIAL? 

Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed,
either within the Company or to third parties, except: (1) as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements; (2) to allow for the tabulation

WHAT HAPPENS IF I SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER MY SHARES OF COMMON STOCK BEFORE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER? 

If you sell or transfer your shares of our Common Stock before consummation of the Merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, in the Merger. In order to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, you
must hold your shares of our Common Stock through consummation of the Merger.

The Record Date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the date the Merger is anticipated to be consummated. Accordingly, if you sell or
transfer your shares of Common Stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between
you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies Cotiviti in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, if the Merger is consummated, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your
shares of our Common Stock, but you will have retained your right to vote these shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of
Common Stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card or vote your shares via the Internet or
telephone.

Table of Contents

WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE CONSUMMATED? 

We currently anticipate that the Merger will be consummated no later than the fourth quarter of 2018, assuming satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the Merger.
However, because the Merger is subject to certain conditions, it is possible that factors outside the control of Cotiviti and Verscend could result in the Merger being
consummated at a later time or not at all.

WHAT EFFECTS WILL THE MERGER HAVE ON COTIVITI? 

Our Common Stock is currently registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and is listed on New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol "COTV." If the Merger is consummated, Cotiviti will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend, and our
Common Stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MERGER IS NOT CONSUMMATED? 

If the Merger Proposal is not approved by our stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, Cotiviti stockholders will retain their shares of our
Common Stock and will not receive any payment for such shares. Instead, Cotiviti will remain a publicly traded company, our Common Stock will continue to be listed and
traded on the New York Stock Exchange and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.

Furthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the Merger not to be consummated, it is possible the price of
our Common Stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our Common Stock would return to the price at which it trades as of
the date of this proxy statement.

Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Verscend a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement as described under the section entitled
"The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees" of this proxy statement.

DO ANY DIRECTORS OR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE INTERESTS IN THE MERGER THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF COTIVITI STOCKHOLDERS
GENERALLY? 

In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the
Merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
evaluating and approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger Proposal be approved by our stockholders. For a description of the
interests of our directors and executive officers in the Merger, see "The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Cotiviti in the Merger."

WILL I BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX UPON THE EXCHANGE OF COMMON STOCK FOR CASH PURSUANT TO THE MERGER? 

The exchange of our Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger generally will require a "U.S. Holder" (as defined below under the section entitled "The Merger—U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" of this proxy statement) to recognize a gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the
difference between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger (determined before deduction for any applicable withholding taxes) and

such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of our Common Stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A "Non-U.S. Holder" (as defined below under the section
entitled "The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" of this proxy statement) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to
the exchange of our Common Stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States. We recommend that you consult your
own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising
under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction or other tax laws. A more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is
provided under "The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger."

WHAT WILL THE HOLDERS OF COTIVITI STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS AND THE PARTICIPANTS IN COTIVITI
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN RECEIVE IN THE MERGER? 

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of our Common Stock that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, will vest in full (to the extent unvested) and will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the
Merger Consideration, net of the applicable per share exercise price, and the aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock subject to the option, subject to applicable
withholding taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld. Options with a per share exercise price equal to or exceeding the Merger Consideration will be
cancelled without payment.

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock and restricted stock units covering shares of our Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will vest in full (to the extent unvested) and will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the Merger
Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock subject to the award (and subject to applicable withholding taxes or other amounts required by
applicable law to be withheld).

The most recent offering period in effect under the Cotiviti Employee Stock Purchase Plans (the "ESPP") ended as scheduled on June 29, 2018 and all outstanding rights to
purchase options under the ESPP were exercised on such date. Thereafter, additional offering periods will be suspended until further notice. Subject to the consummation of
the Merger, the ESPP will terminate as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Participants who purchased shares of our Common Stock under the ESPP, and who
continue to hold such shares as of the Effective Time, will receive the same Merger Consideration in the same manner as other stockholders for each such share the
participant holds as of the Effective Time

AM I ENTITLED TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS INSTEAD OF RECEIVING THE MERGER CONSIDERATION FOR MY SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE DGCL? 

Yes. As a holder of Common Stock, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with the Merger if you take certain actions and
meet certain conditions. Under the DGCL, stockholders who do not vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their
shares of Common Stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, but only if they comply fully with all applicable requirements of the DGCL, which are summarized
in this proxy statement. Any appraisal amount determined by the court could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration. Any stockholder
intending to exercise appraisal rights must, among other things, submit a written demand for appraisal to Cotiviti before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and
must not vote or otherwise submit a proxy in favor of

(iii) the Adjournment Proposal.

THE MERGER PROPOSAL (PAGE 122)

You will be asked to consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will
merge with and into Cotiviti, with Cotiviti continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend, and that at the Effective Time and as a
result of the Merger, each share of our Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held by Cotiviti, Verscend, any
subsidiary of Verscend or any stockholder who properly exercises and perfects appraisal of his, her or its shares under the DGCL) will be automatically cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

RECORD DATE; SHARES ENTITLED TO VOTE; QUORUM (PAGE 33)

You are entitled to receive notice and to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of our Common Stock as of the close of business on July 18, 2018, the Record
Date for the Special Meeting.

A quorum of stockholders is necessary to transact business at the Special Meeting. The presence at the Special Meeting, by remote communication or represented by
proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of the Record Date at the Special Meeting will constitute a quorum
at the Special Meeting, permitting Cotiviti to transact business at the Special Meeting.

Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding and each contingently issuable restricted share of Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on the
Record Date is entitled to one vote at the Special Meeting.

Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of the close of
business on the Record Date. Failure to vote your shares, an abstention from voting your shares or a broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST"
the Merger Proposal.

93,781,958 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and 256,008 contingently issuable restricted shares of Common Stock outstanding.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal. In addition, the Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" each of the
Executive Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.

VOTING AGREEMENT (PAGE 88)

On June 19, 2018, certain direct and indirect stockholders of Cotiviti representing ownership of approximately 44% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock as
of the date of the Merger Agreement entered into the Voting Agreement with Verscend, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions
therein, such stockholders agreed to vote their shares of Common Stock in favor of the Merger Proposal and Adjournment Proposal and against any alternative
proposal (including an Acquisition Proposal) or any other action, agreement or transaction intended to impede or interfere with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the performance of the stockholders under the Voting Agreement. In addition, each stockholder party to the Voting
Agreement waived its appraisal rights under the DGCL. The Voting Agreement terminates upon the earliest to occur of (i) mutual consent by the stockholders party to
the Voting Agreement and Verscend; (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms prior to the Effective Time; (iii) the Cotiviti Board
changing its recommendation that Cotiviti's stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms of and to the extent permitted by the Merger
Agreement; (iv) the Effective Time; and (v) in the event the Merger Agreement is amended without the prior written consent of the stockholders party to the Voting
Agreement and such amendment, among other things, decreases the amount or changes the form of Merger Consideration or otherwise is materially adverse to the
stockholders party to the Voting Agreement relative to the other stockholders of Cotiviti.

FAIRNESS OPINION OF COTIVITI'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR: GOLDMAN SACHS & CO. LLC (PAGE 64)

At the meeting at which the Board voted to approve the proposed transaction, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC ("Goldman Sachs") rendered to the Board its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of June 19, 2018, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs'
written opinion, the $44.75 in cash per share to be paid to the holders (other than Verscend and its affiliates) of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated June 19, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix B.
Goldman Sachs' advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the
proposed transaction and the opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Common Stock should vote with respect to
the proposed transaction or any other matter.

Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs, the Company has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of approximately
$32.3 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the transaction.

FAIRNESS OPINION OF COTIVITI'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR: WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY, L.L.C. (PAGE 73)

William Blair & Company, L.L.C. ("William Blair") was retained to act as financial advisor to the Board in connection with the possible sale of the Company. As part of its
engagement, the Board requested that William Blair render an opinion to the Board as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Common
Stock (other than holders of Dissenting Shares or Cancelled Shares, as such terms are defined in this proxy statement) was fair to such stockholders, from a financial
point of view. On June 19, 2018, William Blair delivered its oral opinion to the Board and subsequently confirmed in writing that, as of June 19, 2018 and based upon
and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations stated therein, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock (other than
holders of Dissenting Shares or Cancelled Shares) was fair to such stockholders, from a financial point of view.

The full text of William Blair's written opinion, dated June 19, 2018, is attached as Appendix C to this proxy statement and incorporated herein by reference.
You are urged to read the entire opinion carefully and in its entirety to learn about the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limits on the scope of the review undertaken by William Blair in rendering its opinion. The analysis performed by William Blair should be viewed in its
entirety; none of the methods of analysis should be viewed in isolation. William Blair's fairness opinion was directed to the Board for its benefit and use in
evaluating the fairness of the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to the Merger Agreement and relates only to the fairness, as of the date of
William Blair's fairness opinion and from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock (other than
holders of Dissenting Shares or Cancelled Shares) in the proposed Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement. William Blair's fairness opinion does not
address any other aspects of the proposed transaction or any related transaction, and does not constitute a recommendation to any of the holders of
Common Stock as to how that stockholder should vote or otherwise act with respect to the Merger Agreement or the proposed transaction. William Blair did
not address the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the proposed transaction.

See Appendix C and the section entitled "The Merger—Fairness Opinion of Cotiviti's Financial Advisor: William Blair & Company, L.L.C." of this proxy statement.

CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE MERGER ON COTIVITI (PAGE 42)

Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Cotiviti, with Cotiviti
continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend.

The Effective Time will occur, if it occurs, upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later date and time as
we and Verscend may agree and specify in the certificate of merger). If the Merger is consummated, you will no longer own any shares of the capital stock of Cotiviti as
of the Effective Time.

Our Common Stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "COTV." If the Merger is
consummated, Cotiviti will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend, and our Common Stock will be delisted from
the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

EFFECT ON COTIVITI IF THE MERGER IS NOT CONSUMMATED (PAGE 42)

If the Merger Proposal is not approved by Cotiviti stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, Cotiviti stockholders will continue to hold their
shares of Common Stock and will not receive any payment for such shares. Instead, Cotiviti will remain a public company, our Common Stock will continue to be listed
and traded on the New York Stock Exchange and registered under the Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Under specified
circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, Cotiviti may be required to pay Verscend a termination fee or reimburse Verscend for transaction expenses,
as described under the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees" of this proxy statement.

Furthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the Merger not to be consummated, it is possible the
price of our Common Stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our Common Stock would return to the price at which
it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

Under specified circumstances, Cotiviti may be required to pay Verscend a termination fee upon termination of the Merger Agreement, as described under the section
entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees" of this proxy statement.

MERGER CONSIDERATION (PAGE 43)

Upon consummation of the Merger, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Verscend, Merger Sub or Cotiviti or their
respective stockholders, each outstanding share of our Common Stock (including shares of Common Stock that were issued as restricted Common Stock that have
vested on or prior to the date of the consummation of the Merger, but excluding (i) shares held by Verscend or any subsidiary of Verscend (including Merger Sub)
immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Cancelled Shares") and (ii) Dissenting Shares), will be converted into the right to receive $44.75 in cash, which we refer to as
the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate and each holder of a non-certificated share of Common Stock represented by book-entry
(each, a "Book-Entry Share"), in each case, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time previously representing any such shares of Common Stock will
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such certificates and Book-Entry Shares, the Merger
Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. As described further under the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Payment for
Common Stock" of this proxy statement, prior to the Effective Time, Verscend will deposit or cause to be deposited, with a nationally recognized financial institution as
paying agent, cash in an amount necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to all of the holders of Common Stock including Common Stock
represented by a Book-Entry Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than the Cancelled Shares, restricted shares pursuant to a Cotiviti
restricted stock award and except for any Dissenting Shares (and which shall not include any amounts payable to the holders of Cotiviti options, restricted stock unit
awards and restricted stock awards, which will be paid through Cotiviti's payroll system). Promptly following the Effective Time and in any event no later than the second
business day following the Effective Time, you will receive a letter of transmittal instructing you to send your Book-Entry Shares to the paying agent in order to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of our Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Shares.

Table of Contents

After the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes, but you will no longer have any rights as a Cotiviti stockholder as a result of the Merger (except with respect to Dissenting Shares), nor will
you be entitled to receive any shares in Verscend or the surviving corporation.

TREATMENT OF EQUITY AWARDS; ESPP (PAGE 100)

Under the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of our Common Stock that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will vest in full (to the extent unvested) and will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
a cash payment equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of the applicable per share exercise price, and the aggregate number of shares of our Common
Stock subject to the option, subject to applicable withholding taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld. Options with a per share exercise price
equal to or exceeding the Merger Consideration will be cancelled without payment.

The Merger Agreement also provides that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock and restricted stock units covering shares of our
Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will vest in full (to the extent unvested) and will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock subject
to the award (and subject to applicable withholding taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld).

The most recent offering period in effect under the ESPP ended as scheduled on June 29, 2018 and all outstanding rights to purchase options under the ESPP were
exercised on such date. Thereafter, additional offering periods will be suspended until further notice. Subject to the consummation of the Merger, the ESPP will
terminate as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Participants who purchased shares of our Common Stock under the ESPP and who continue to hold such
shares as of the Effective Time will receive the same Merger Consideration in the same manner as other stockholders for each such share the participant holds as of
the Effective Time.

INTERESTS OF THE DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF COTIVITI IN THE MERGER (PAGE 84)

When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may
have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them,
among other matters, in evaluating and approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger Proposal be approved by our
stockholders. These interests include the following:

• certain of our directors and executive officers hold outstanding Common Stock, stock options and restricted stock unit awards that will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, net of any applicable exercise price (and subject to applicable tax withholding); 

• our executive officers are parties to arrangements with Cotiviti that provide for severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations of
employment in connection with the Merger;

• certain of our executive officers may receive transaction or retention cash bonuses in connection with the Merger; and 

• consummation of the Merger Agreement provides for continued indemnification and directors' and officers' liability insurance to be provided by the
surviving corporation.

If the Merger Proposal is approved by our stockholders and the Merger closes, any shares of our Common Stock held by our directors and executive officers will be
treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of our Common Stock held by all other Cotiviti stockholders entitled to receive the Merger Consideration.

FINANCING OF THE MERGER (PAGE 88)

The Merger Agreement is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Verscend. We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to consummate the Merger and
the related transactions, not including fees and expenses, will be approximately $4.9 billion, including the estimated funds needed to (i) pay our stockholders the Merger
Consideration due to them under the Merger Agreement; (ii) make payments in respect of outstanding Cotiviti stock options, restricted stock unit awards and restricted
stock awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement; and (iii) pay the outstanding net indebtedness of Cotiviti.

Verscend has obtained financing commitments for the purpose of financing the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and paying
related fees and expenses (the "Financing"). The Veritas Capital Fund VI, L.P. has committed to capitalize Verscend, immediately prior to the Effective Time, with an
aggregate equity contribution of up to $790 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in an equity commitment letter. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (together
with certain of its affiliates, the "Lenders") has agreed to provide Verscend and Verscend Holding Corp. (Verscend's immediate parent) with debt financing in an
aggregate principal amount of up to $4,615 million on the terms set forth in a debt commitment letter. Additionally, Verscend and Verscend Holding Corp. have received
a preferred equity commitment in an amount of up to $575 million on the terms set forth in a preferred equity commitment letter. The obligations of the Lenders to
provide debt financing under the debt commitment letter, and the obligations of the preferred investors to provide preferred equity financing under the preferred equity
commitment letter, in each case, are subject to customary terms and conditions. The Merger Agreement provides that Verscend and Verscend Holding Corp. will use
reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary or advisable to arrange and obtain and consummate the Financing on or prior to the Effective Time.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE 89)

Pursuant to Section 262, stockholders who do not vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and who comply fully with and properly demand appraisal under
the applicable requirements of Section 262 and do not otherwise withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under the DGCL, have the right to seek appraisal of the fair
value of their shares, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, if the Merger is consummated. The "fair value" of shares as determined by the Delaware Court
of Chancery may be more than, less than, or equal to the value of the Merger Consideration that the stockholders would otherwise be entitled to receive under the
terms of the Merger Agreement. Stockholders also should be aware that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, "fair value" under Section 262. Stockholders
who wish to preserve any appraisal rights they may have, must so advise Cotiviti by submitting a written demand for appraisal prior to the vote to adopt the Merger
Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and must otherwise follow fully the procedures prescribed by Section 262. For a
description of the rights of such holders and of the procedures to be followed in order to assert such rights and obtain

which is reproduced in its entirety as Appendix D to this proxy statement.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (PAGE 94)

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for such U.S. Holder's shares of Common Stock in the Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in
an amount measured by the difference between the cash such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger (determined before deduction for any applicable withholding taxes)
and such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of Common Stock surrendered in the Merger. A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax with respect to the exchange of our Common Stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.
Stockholders should refer to the discussion under the section entitled "The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" of this proxy statement and
consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any
consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction or other tax laws.

REGULATORY APPROVALS REQUIRED FOR THE MERGER (PAGE 96)

Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be consummated until the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended (the "HSR Act"), has expired or been terminated. Cotiviti and Verscend and their respective affiliates filed their respective HSR Act notifications on July 2,
2018. On July 13, 2018, the Federal Trade Commission notified Cotiviti and Verscend that their request for early termination of the applicable waiting period was
granted.

NO SOLICITATION; ACQUISITION PROPOSALS (PAGE 105)

From June 19, 2018 until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date the Merger Agreement is validly terminated by its terms, Cotiviti is generally not permitted to (and
will cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees generally not to, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives
generally not to):

• solicit, initiate, seek, or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiry, discussion, offer or request relating to, or that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement); 

• enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any non-public information relating to Cotiviti and its
subsidiaries to, or afford access to the properties, books or records or employees of Cotiviti and its subsidiaries to, any third party with respect to or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, except that Cotiviti may grant a waiver of or terminate any "standstill" or similar
agreement or obligation of any third party with respect to Cotiviti and its subsidiaries to allow such third party to submit an Acquisition Proposal; 

• approve, endorse, recommend or enter into (or publicly propose to approve, endorse, recommend or enter into) any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
(other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement); or 

• agree, propose or resolve to take, or take, any of the foregoing actions.

However, if before obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Approval (as defined and described under the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other
Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals" of this proxy statement), Cotiviti receives a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from
a third-party that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement (other than any breach that is both immaterial and
unintentional) and the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal (as defined and described under the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and
Agreements—No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals" of this proxy statement) and the failure to take the action immediately below would be inconsistent with the Board's
fiduciary duties to Cotiviti's stockholders under applicable law, Cotiviti and its representatives may:

• furnish non-public information, and afford access to the books and records or officers of Cotiviti and its subsidiaries to such third party and its
representatives pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement; and 

• engage in discussions and negotiations with such third party concerning the Acquisition Proposal.

Except as described below, neither the Board nor any committee of the Board is permitted to take any action constituting an Adverse Recommendation Change (as
defined and described under the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals" of this proxy
statement) or to adopt or approve, or cause or permit Cotiviti to enter into or otherwise resolve or agree to any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an acceptable
confidentiality agreement).

Before obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Approval and after first complying with the non-solicitation and related provisions of the Merger Agreement, the
Board, in response to a Superior Proposal received by Cotiviti or the Board that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation and related provisions of the Merger
Agreement (other than any breach that is both immaterial and unintentional), may authorize and cause Cotiviti to:

• effect an Adverse Recommendation Change; and 

• validly terminate the Merger Agreement and substantially concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive agreement providing for such Superior
Proposal (subject to first complying with Cotiviti's obligations in the non-solicitation and related provisions of the Merger Agreement and satisfaction of the
termination fee obligations of Cotiviti described below).

However, the Board is not permitted to take the actions described in the bullet points immediately above unless, among other things, (i) the Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisor, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board's fiduciary duties to the
stockholders under applicable law; (ii) at least three business days elapse after Cotiviti provides Verscend with written notice that it intends to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change and terminate the Merger Agreement, which such written notice includes written notice of the material terms of the Superior Proposal; and
(iii) in such three-business day period, Cotiviti and its representatives have discussed and negotiated with Verscend in good faith (to the extent Verscend so desires to
negotiate) any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (as described under the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other
Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation;

deliver a new written notice of its intent to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and terminate the Merger Agreement and a new two-business day negotiating
period is triggered from the date of such new notice.

In addition, before obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Approval, the Board, in response to an Intervening Event (as defined and described under the section
entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals" of this proxy statement), may authorize and cause Cotiviti
to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change.

However, the Board is not permitted to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change for an Intervening Event unless, among other things, (i) the Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisor, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board's fiduciary duties to the
stockholders under applicable law; (ii) at least three business days elapse after Cotiviti provides Verscend with written notice that it intends to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change; and (iii) in such three-business day period, Cotiviti and its representatives have discussed and negotiated with Verscend in good faith (to the
extent Verscend so desired) any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (as described under the section entitled "The Merger
Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals" of this proxy statement).

For a further discussion of the limitations on solicitation of Acquisition Proposals from third parties, the limitations on Adverse Recommendation Changes and approving
or recommending a Superior Proposal, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals" of
this proxy statement.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (PAGE 114)

• (i) the consummation of the Merger shall not then be enjoined, made illegal or otherwise prohibited by any governmental order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent), (ii) no law will have been adopted or promulgated, or will be in effect, enjoining, making illegal or otherwise prohibiting the

THE SPECIAL MEETING

We are furnishing this proxy statement to the Cotiviti stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Board for use at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof. This proxy statement provides the Cotiviti stockholders with the information they need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the
Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

DATE AND TIME OF THE SPECIAL MEETING 

This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Board for use at the Special Meeting to be held on August 24, 2018 at
9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. The Special Meeting will be held online at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/COTV2018SM.

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING 

At the Special Meeting, we will ask our stockholders of record as of the Record Date to vote on (i) the Merger Proposal, (ii) the Executive Compensation Proposal and
(iii) Adjournment Proposal. If our holders of Common Stock fail to adopt the Merger Agreement by approving the Merger Proposal, the Merger will not occur. A copy of the
Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A, and the material provisions of the Merger Agreement are described under the section entitled "The
Merger Agreement" of this proxy statement.

This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to our stockholders on or about July 23, 2018.

RECORD DATE; SHARES ENTITLED TO VOTE; QUORUM 

Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 18, 2018, the Record Date for the Special Meeting, are entitled to notice and to vote at the Special Meeting or
at any adjournments or postponements thereof. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available in our offices located at One Glenlake Parkway,
Suite 1400, Atlanta, Georgia 30328, during regular business hours for a period of at least 10 days before the Special Meeting and at the place of the Special Meeting during
the meeting.

As of the Record Date, there were approximately 94,037,966 shares of our Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, comprising
93,781,958 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and 256,008 contingently issuable restricted shares of Common Stock outstanding.

A quorum of stockholders is necessary to transact business at the Special Meeting. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") provide that the presence at the
Special Meeting, by remote communication or represented by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the
meeting (47,018,983 shares) will constitute a quorum for Cotiviti to transact business at a Special Meeting. In general, shares of our Common Stock represented by a
properly signed and returned proxy card will be counted as shares present and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. Shares
represented by proxies received but marked "ABSTAIN" will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the Special Meeting for
purposes of determining a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the Special Meeting for
purposes of determining a quorum.

Table of Contents

In the event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, it is expected that the meeting would be adjourned to a later date to solicit additional proxies, and a quorum
will have to be established at such adjourned date.

VOTE REQUIRED; ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES 

Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding and each contingently issuable restricted share of Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on the
Record Date is entitled to one vote at the Special Meeting.

Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of the Record
Date. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders is a condition to the closing of the Merger.

Approval of each of the Executive Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our Common Stock representing a
majority of the votes cast (excluding abstentions) on the matter at the Special Meeting.

If a Cotiviti stockholder fails to vote or abstains from voting, it will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal. If a Cotiviti stockholder
fails to vote or abstains from voting, it will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

If you hold your shares in "street name," the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares will result in a broker non-vote. Broker non-votes
will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal, but will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.

SHARES HELD BY DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 

As of the close of business on the Record Date, directors and executive officers of Cotiviti and their affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
5,996,441 shares of our Common Stock, which represented approximately 6.4% of the shares of our Common Stock that would have been entitled to vote at the special
meeting if held as of that date. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of Common Stock (i) "FOR" the
Merger Proposal; (ii) "FOR" the Executive Compensation Proposal and (iii) "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal, although none of them is obligated to do so.

On June 19, 2018, certain direct and indirect stockholders of Cotiviti representing ownership of approximately 44% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock as of the
date of the Merger Agreement, entered into the Voting Agreement with Verscend, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions therein, such
stockholders agreed to vote their shares of our Common Stock in favor of the Merger Proposal and Adjournment Proposal and against any alternative proposal (including an
Acquisition Proposal) or any other action, agreement or transaction intended to impede or interfere with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or the performance of the stockholders under the Voting Agreement.

Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy 

To ensure that your shares of Common Stock are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions by proxy as soon as possible, whether or
not you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting.

Shares of Common Stock Held by a Record Holder 

If you are a stockholder of record and your shares of Common Stock are registered in your name with our transfer agent, AST, you may provide voting instructions by proxy
using one of the methods described below.

Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for submitting voting instructions. You may vote by
telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the Internet by accessing the Internet address as specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares of Common Stock will be
voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy card, as described below. You must have the enclosed proxy card
available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to submit a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone.

Submit a Proxy Card. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in time for the Special Meeting, your shares of Common

Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special
Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted
"FOR" each of the Merger Proposal, the Executive Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting. If you fail to return your proxy card and you are a holder of record as of the
close of business on the Record Date, the effect of such failure to vote will be that your shares of Common Stock will not be considered present at the Special Meeting for
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting,

will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal, and will not have an effect on the vote regarding the Executive Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal.

Shares of Common Stock Held in "Street Name" 

If your shares of Common Stock are held in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee, your bank, broker or other nominee will send you instructions as to how to
provide voting instructions for your shares. You may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee, or over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee if such a service is provided by them to you. To vote via the Internet
or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.

Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the discretion to vote your shares on "routine" matters if you fail to instruct your bank, broker
or other nominee on how to vote your shares with respect to such matters. Each of the Merger Proposal, the Executive Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment
Proposal are "non-routine" matters, and your bank, broker and other nominee therefore cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Accordingly, if you do not
return your voting form to your bank, broker or other nominee and do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if applicable, such
actions will result in a "broker non-vote." Broker non-votes will not be considered present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at
the Special Meeting, will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal and will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal.

REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES 

Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting. If you are a stockholder of
record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by:

• granting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy); 

• providing a written notice of revocation to the Secretary at our offices at Cotiviti Holdings, Inc., One Glenlake Parkway, Suite 1400, Atlanta, GA 30328, prior to
your shares being voted; or 

• attending the virtual Special Meeting online and voting your shares electronically during the Special Meeting.

Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Participating in the Special Meeting without taking one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke
your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to Cotiviti or by sending a written notice of revocation to Cotiviti, you should ensure
that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by Cotiviti before the Special Meeting. Please note that to be effective,
your new proxy card, Internet or telephonic voting instructions or written notice of revocation must be received by our Secretary prior to the Special Meeting and, in the case
of Internet or telephonic voting instructions, must be received before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on August 23, 2018.

If you hold your shares of Common Stock in "street name," you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote or
submit new voting instructions. Any adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies will

allow Cotiviti stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Special Meeting, as adjourned or postponed.

ABSTENTIONS 

An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either by remote communication or represented by proxy, but abstains from voting. Abstentions will be included
in the calculation of the number of shares of Common Stock represented at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.
Abstaining from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal but will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal.

ADJOURNMENTS AND POSTPONEMENTS 

Although it is not currently expected, subject to certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement, the Special Meeting may be adjourned or postponed for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies. Under our Bylaws, the Special Meeting may be adjourned or postponed by the Board at any time in advance of the meeting, or by the chairperson of the
Special Meeting if a quorum is not present. If the Board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, or if the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the
adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting as of such new record date. In addition, the Board could postpone the
Special Meeting before it commences. If the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies
will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Special Meeting as so adjourned or postponed.

In the event that there is present at the Special Meeting, by remote communication or represented by proxy, sufficient favorable voting power to secure the vote of our
stockholders necessary to adopt the Merger Agreement by approving the Merger Proposal, we do not anticipate that we will adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting.

BOARD RECOMMENDATION 

The Board, after considering various factors described under the section entitled "The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger" of this proxy
statement, unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of Cotiviti and its stockholders, and directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, be submitted to the stockholders of Cotiviti for their adoption.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote (i) "FOR" the Merger Proposal; (ii) "FOR" the Executive Compensation Proposal and (iii) "FOR" the Adjournment
Proposal.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES 

The Board is soliciting your proxy, and we will bear the cost of this solicitation of proxies, including the preparation, assembly and mailing of the proxies and soliciting material,
as well as the charges and expenses of brokerage firms and others for forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners of our Common Stock.

Proxies may be solicited by mail, personal interview, e-mail, telephone, facsimile or via the Internet, without additional compensation, by certain of Cotiviti' directors, officers
and employees.

ANTICIPATED DATE OF CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER 

We currently anticipate that the Merger will be consummated no later than the fourth quarter of 2018, assuming satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the Merger.
However, because the Merger is subject to certain conditions, it is possible that factors outside the control of Cotiviti and Verscend could result in the Merger being
consummated at a later time or not at all.

MARKET PRICES AND DIVIDEND DATA

Our Common Stock has been traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "COTV" since May 26, 2016. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our
shares. The table below sets forth, for the periods indicated, the range of high and low closing prices per share of our Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock
Exchange.

 

 

As of the Record Date, there were approximately 94,037,966 shares of our Common Stock outstanding, held by approximately 47 stockholders of record. The actual number
of stockholders is considerably greater than this number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by
brokers and other nominees.

Prior to the consummation of our initial public offering, we paid a special cash dividend of $150.0 million or $1.94 per share of common stock outstanding, to holders of record
of our Common Stock on May 24, 2016. Since then, we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not currently intend to pay, nor under
the Merger Agreement may we pay without the prior written consent of Verscend, any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.

On June 4, 2018 (the last day before news reports suggested that the Company was engaged in a transaction process), the closing price of our Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange was $33.95 per share. On June 18, 2018, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement, the closing
price of our Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $39.89 per share. On July 20, 2018, the latest practicable trading day before the printing of this proxy
statement, the closing price of our Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $44.41 per share. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for
Common Stock.

Our Common Stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act. If the Merger is consummated, Cotiviti will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend, and our Common Stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

THE MERGER

This discussion of the Merger does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement
as Appendix A and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. You should read the entire Merger Agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the
Merger.

CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE MERGER ON COTIVITI 

If the Merger Agreement is adopted by the Cotiviti stockholders and all other conditions to the closing of the Merger are either satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with
and into Cotiviti, with Cotiviti continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend.

At the Effective Time, each share of our Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares)
will be converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. If the Merger is consummated,
you will no longer own any shares of capital stock of Cotiviti as of the Effective Time.

Our Common Stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "COTV." If the Merger is consummated,
Cotiviti will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend, and our Common Stock will be delisted from the New York Stock
Exchange and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

EFFECT ON COTIVITI IF THE MERGER IS NOT CONSUMMATED 

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, Cotiviti stockholders will continue to hold their shares
of Common Stock and will not receive any payment for such shares of Common Stock. Instead, Cotiviti will remain a public company, our Common Stock will continue to be
listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.

Furthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that would have caused the Merger not to be consummated, it is possible that the price
of our Common Stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our Common Stock would return to the price at which it trades as
of the date of this proxy statement.

Accordingly, if the Merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future value of your shares of our Common
Stock. If the Merger is not consummated, the Board will continue to evaluate and review our business operations, assets, operating results, financial condition, prospects and
business strategy, among other things, and make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to seek to enhance stockholder value. If the Merger Agreement is
not adopted by our stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to Cotiviti will be
offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.

In addition, under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Verscend a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described under the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee" of this proxy statement.

MERGER CONSIDERATION 

Upon consummation of the Merger, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Verscend, Merger Sub or Cotiviti or their respective
stockholders, each outstanding share of our Common Stock (including shares of Common Stock that were issued as restricted Common Stock that have vested on or prior to
the date of the consummation of the Merger, but excluding Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares), will be converted into the right to receive $44.75 in cash, which we refer
to as the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled
and retired and will cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate and each holder of a Book-Entry Share, in each case, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
previously representing any such shares of Common Stock will thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities other than the right to receive, upon
surrender of such certificates and Book-Entry Shares, the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. As described further under the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Payment for Common Stock" of this proxy statement, prior to the Effective Time, Verscend will deposit or cause to be deposited,
with a nationally recognized financial institution as paying agent, cash in an amount necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to all of the holders of
Common Stock including Common Stock represented by a Book-Entry Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than the Cancelled Shares, restricted
shares pursuant to a Cotiviti restricted stock award and except for any Dissenting Shares (and which shall not include any amounts payable to the holders of Cotiviti options,
restricted stock unit awards and restricted stock awards, which will be paid through Cotiviti's payroll system). Promptly following the Effective Time and in any event no later
than the second business day following the Effective Time, you will receive a letter of transmittal instructing you to send your Book-Entry Shares to the paying agent in order
to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of our Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry
Shares.

After the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes, but you will no longer have any rights as a Cotiviti stockholder as a result of the Merger (except with respect to Dissenting Shares), nor will you
be entitled to receive any shares in Verscend or the surviving corporation.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER 

The Company was incorporated in Delaware on June 4, 2012 and operated as a privately held company until May 26, 2016, when it completed an initial public offering of its
common stock. The Board, together with Company senior management, regularly reviews and assesses the Company's performance, stock price, risks, opportunities and
strategy in light of the current business and economic environment, as well as evolving industry dynamics as they may affect the Company's long-term strategic goals and
plans. As a matter of practice, the Board and Company senior management, together with their legal and financial advisors, regularly review and evaluate a wide range of the
Company's strategic opportunities for business combinations, acquisitions and other financial and strategic alternatives, including continuing as a standalone company, with a
view to maximizing shareholder value. Additionally, the Board and Company senior management have identified, and from time to time discussed and evaluated, the
significant costs and risks associated with operating as an independent, standalone public company, including costs associated with transitioning from managing a privately
held company to managing a public company, risks associated with the evolving healthcare regulatory environment across the

Company's businesses, and the increasing competitive intensity of the healthcare and retail sectors in which the Company operates.

During 2017, through several registered secondary public offerings, affiliates of Advent International Corporation ("Advent") sold a portion of their shares of the Company's
common stock such that since August 7, 2017, Advent and its affiliates have held less than 50% of the Company's outstanding common stock. As of the date of this proxy
statement, Advent and its affiliates hold an aggregate of approximately 44% of the combined voting power of the Common Stock.

Between late November 2017 and early 2018, the Company received, either directly or through financial advisors, expressions of interest from potential counterparties
regarding a possible transaction with the Company. These expressions of interest were promptly conveyed to senior management and the Board, but did not progress or
result in any specific proposals.

On February 11, 2018, representatives of a potential counterparty ("Private Equity Firm A") and one of its portfolio companies ("Party A") submitted to Mr. Doug Williams,
Chief Executive Officer of the Company and a member of the Board, and David Swift, the Chairman of the Board, a written non-binding proposal (the "February 2018
Proposal"), based on publicly available information, to acquire the Company for $39 per share in cash, which represented a 21% premium over the Company's closing stock
price of $32.33 per share on February 9, 2018.

On February 13, 2018 and February 14, 2018, the Board held a regularly scheduled in-person meeting, at which Bradley Ferguson, Chief Financial Officer of the Company,
and Jonathan Olefson, General Counsel of the Company, were present. At the meeting, Mr. Olefson informed the Board of the Company's receipt of the February 2018
Proposal and discussed the contents of the proposal, and reminded the Board of the various parties which had previously expressed interest in transactions involving the
Company. The Board discussed the February 2018 Proposal and the strategic and financial position of the Company, macro-economic conditions, the factors and variables
that impact growth rates and value creation for the Company, and several other related matters. The Board determined to undertake a comprehensive review of the
Company's available strategic opportunities, including a potential sale, strategic acquisitions, recapitalizations, share repurchases, and other strategic and financial
arrangements. The Board also determined to undertake a comprehensive review of the standalone plan for the Company, and certain risks and opportunities associated
therewith. Mr. Olefson reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties, including in the context of considering strategic alternatives.

At the Board's direction, Company management subsequently retained Latham & Watkins LLP ("Latham") as the Company's outside legal advisor in connection with the
evaluation and negotiation of a potential strategic transaction on the basis of Latham's history with the Company, expertise advising companies in the healthcare and
technology industries, and its expertise in mergers and acquisitions.

On February 14, 2018, the Board unanimously resolved to form a Strategy Committee, composed of directors Mr. John Maldonado, Mr. James Parisi and Mr. Halsey Wise, to
assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities relating to the review, evaluation, and negotiation of potential strategic decisions that could be available to the Company,
including the review of the Company's standalone plan. The Board discussed the possibility of a Strategy Committee comprised solely of members of the Board who were not
affiliated with Advent, but determined that Advent's interests with respect to a potential transaction appeared to be aligned with those of the other shareholders, that given his
knowledge and expertise Mr. Maldonado would provide invaluable contributions to the review process, and that if potential conflicts of interest arose then that issue could be
revisited and addressed. The Strategy Committee subsequently appointed Mr. Wise as chairman due to his management and mergers and acquisitions experience. The

Board also authorized the Strategy Committee to independently engage legal, financial and other advisors and consultants.

On February 15, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of Latham were present. The
Strategy Committee and Latham reviewed the responsibilities and authority of the members of the Strategy Committee and the directors' fiduciary duties in the context of
evaluating the Company's long-term strategic plan, including considering strategic alternatives. The Strategy Committee also discussed the importance of evaluating existing
and potential conflicts of interest, including the importance of considering personal and financial relationships of the members of the Strategy Committee, and the Board
generally, and whether there might be differing interests as between Advent and the other shareholders of the Company. The Strategy Committee also discussed that
members of Company management could have different interests from the Company's shareholders, and that those interests would need to be monitored in the strategic
review.

The members of the Strategy Committee then discussed the potential retention of a financial advisor to the Company. Following discussion, the Strategy Committee
determined that the Company should retain Goldman Sachs to assist with the evaluation of broad-based strategic alternatives, including the February 2018 Proposal, as well
as the Company's standalone plan, based on Goldman Sachs' experience and expertise as a financial adviser in a wide variety of transactions and due to its familiarity with
the healthcare industry and the Company.

After consideration and discussion with management and the Company's financial and legal advisors, the Strategy Committee authorized a letter to Private Equity Firm A and
Party A in response to the February 2018 Proposal (which was subsequently delivered on February 17, 2018) explaining that the Board intended to evaluate the strategic
alternatives available to the Company and would not be responding to the February 2018 Proposal until that review was completed.

On February 22, 2018, the Company entered into a customary confidentiality agreement with Goldman Sachs in connection with the Company's potential retention of
Goldman Sachs as a financial advisor to the Company.

On February 23, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of Latham and Goldman Sachs
were present, to discuss the Company's standalone plan in view of consolidation in the sector. During this meeting, the Strategy Committee and management also discussed
potential interests that management (including Mr. Williams) and members of the Board might have with various counterparties to potential transactions involving the
Company, and concluded that no such interests adversely impacted the process at that stage.

Also on February 23, 2018, a representative of an investment bank ("Bank A") left a voicemail with Mr. Williams, indicating that Bank A had been approached by a
representative of a potential counterparty ("Party B") to discuss Party B's possible retention of Bank A in connection with a bid to acquire the Company. In the voicemail, the
Bank A representative explained that Bank A would prefer to represent the Company in a potential strategic transaction. The Company did not respond to this expression of
interest.

On February 27, 2018, a representative of Veritas Capital Fund Management, L.L.C. ("Veritas Capital") called Mr. Maldonado to discuss the Company's business and a
potential strategic transaction involving the Company. Mr. Maldonado subsequently informed the other members of the Strategy Committee and Goldman Sachs about Veritas
Capital's expression of interest.

On March 2, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham and Goldman
Sachs were present. Representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the Strategy Committee a number of illustrative strategic alternatives, including continuing on the
Company's standalone plan, exploring the Company's expansion through an acquisition or merger, and pursuing a sale of the Company. Representatives of Latham then
reviewed Goldman Sachs' relationships with Advent, which are summarized below under the section entitled "The Merger—Fairness Opinion of Cotiviti's Financial Advisor:
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC" of this proxy statement. The Strategy Committee determined that, based on the information then provided, such relationships would not preclude
Goldman Sachs from effectively advising the Company.

On March 9, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham and Goldman
Sachs were present, to discuss recent strategic transactions in the industry, public market perspectives on the Company, and Goldman Sachs' preliminary financial analyses
relating to the Company. Members of Company management then discussed the Company's business model, including related risks and opportunities.

On March 12, 2018, a representative of Veritas Capital contacted Mr. Maldonado to express Veritas Capital's continued interest in engaging with the Company in a potential
strategic transaction. Mr. Maldonado reminded Veritas Capital that any such interest would be subject to consideration by the full Board. Mr. Maldonado subsequently
informed the other members of the Strategy Committee and Goldman Sachs about Veritas Capital's outreach.

On March 14, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of Latham were present, to discuss
the status of management's preliminary projections.

On March 16, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham and Goldman
Sachs were present, to discuss Goldman Sachs' preliminary financial analyses of the Company, which contained analytics relating to a variety of strategic alternatives
involving the Company. Representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an overview of potential strategic alternatives involving the Company, including share repurchases, bolt-
on and other strategic acquisitions, and a merger or sale of the Company, as well as an overview of recent transactions in the healthcare industry. Representatives of
Goldman Sachs then reviewed with the Strategy Committee potential strategic partners who had expressed an interest or which Goldman Sachs believed might have an
interest in acquiring the Company (including three potential counterparties who had recently contacted the Company or Goldman Sachs expressing interest in a potential
transaction with the Company, which are referred to as "Private Equity Firm B", "Private Equity Firm C" and "Private Equity Firm D"). Representatives of Goldman Sachs
discussed the financial strength, capital structures, and risks involved with gauging interest from such parties, including that a broad transaction process could also increase
the likelihood of leaks that could be disruptive to the Company's ongoing business. The Strategy Committee discussed methods to mitigate these risks. Representatives of
Goldman Sachs and the Strategy Committee discussed the process of engaging with potential strategic partners and the importance of crafting a transaction process that
would permit the Board to pursue strategic opportunities that would provide the most value to the Company's shareholders, should the Board decide to initiate a transaction
process, and the advantages and disadvantages of engaging with financial sponsors as opposed to strategic counterparties. The Strategy Committee also discussed market
activity and timing for the Company to explore a potential strategic transaction. The Strategy Committee concluded that it was an opportune time for the Company to consider
strategic alternatives.

On March 20, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham and Goldman
Sachs were present, to discuss

Goldman Sachs' updated preliminary financial analyses, as well as potential strategic alternatives involving the Company, including the Company's standalone plan with
potential for bolt-on opportunities and/or share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, and a merger or sale of the Company, and the potential impact of illustrative share
repurchase activity on the Company's price per share. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also discussed potential counterparties and illustrative transaction process
structures. The Strategy Committee and Latham also discussed, among other things, the healthcare and equity markets, the Company's trajectory as a public company, and
the Company's relative strengths and weaknesses as a potential acquirer and the risks of integrating businesses.

On March 27, 2018, the Board held a special telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham and Goldman Sachs
were present. Latham reviewed the directors' fiduciary duties, including in the context of evaluating the Company's strategic alternatives. Latham also provided a summary of
financial and personal relationships as between Mr. Williams and each member of the Strategy Committee, on the one hand, and various potential participants in a strategic
transaction, on the other hand. The Board concluded that these relationships were immaterial. Mr. Wise then presented to the Board the work conducted by the Strategy
Committee, including: (1) a discussion of the process to review and test the standalone plan of the Company; (2) a discussion of the broad scope of ideas explored and
weighed, including potential acquisitions, mergers of equals, divestitures of units, recapitalizations, a sale of the Company and other alternatives, including to continue the
standalone plan; (3) a discussion of Advent's position and how its interests and investment horizon could potentially be different than those of other shareholders of the
Company; (4) different ways of structuring a transaction process for the Company; (5) Company-specific issues and macro issues that might impact the Company's strategy;
and (6) the use of regular executive sessions to ensure a thorough review of all alternatives to maximize value for all of the Company's shareholders. The Board then
reviewed and discussed Company management's standalone plan and its underlying assumptions. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then provided a summary of the work
conducted by Goldman Sachs in conjunction with the Strategy Committee, as well as an overview of various strategic alternatives. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also
discussed the contents of the relationship disclosure letter it had delivered to the Company the previous week. The Board discussed the Company's various strategic
alternatives and potential benefits and risks to the Company's shareholders associated with those alternatives, including general market risk, the possibility of upcoming
consolidation in the industry (and whether the Company's shareholders would better benefit from receiving cash as compared to the risks of integration by combining with
other companies), the Company's current and potential performance, and other factors. The Board also discussed the potential for conflicts, including as related to Advent
(such as a different investment horizon and/or the desire to invest in a transaction) and management, how a transaction process could be conducted, how conflicts should be
monitored, and the risks associated with a failed transaction process. The Board determined that it was in the best interests of the shareholders to run a process designed to
determine whether there was a strategic transaction that would maximize value to shareholders. After extensive discussion about the Strategy Committee (including whether
to have a committee comprised entirely of members of the Board who were not affiliated with Advent), the Board unanimously determined to reconstitute and further empower
the Strategy Committee, to be comprised of four Board members - Messrs. Wise, Parisi, Maldonado and Kenneth Goulet. The Strategy Committee was also instructed (i) to
retain a financial advisor for the Board, which could include Goldman Sachs, and a financial advisor for the Strategy Committee, to provide additional input and perspective,
(ii) to design and conduct a process to explore a sale of the Company (and the Board determined that it would then evaluate, based on the results of that process, whether a
sale of the Company would be in the best interests of the Company's shareholders), and (iii) to regularly monitor for potential conflicts and evaluate the appropriate manner to
address those conflicts.

In late March 2018, at the recommendation of Latham, Company management retained Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A. ("RLF"), to serve as Delaware counsel to the
Company based on RLF's expertise in Delaware law and governance matters.

On March 30, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham and Goldman
Sachs were present, to discuss how to design a transaction process that would maximize shareholder value, identify and mitigate conflicts of interest and avoid undue harm
to the Company if such process was not successful. The Strategy Committee reviewed a list of potential counterparties prepared by Goldman Sachs, including a mix of
strategic and financial counterparties. The Strategy Committee determined, after consultation with Goldman Sachs, that a focused solicitation should be pursued to minimize
risks of public disclosure and potential customer disruption, and instructed Goldman Sachs to contact a limited number of counterparties that, based on their financial capacity
and experience in the Company's industry, were most likely to be feasible counterparties.

            Between April 2, 2018 and April 9, 2018, as directed by the Strategy Committee and Company management, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted seven
potential strategic counterparties, five financial sponsors, and four private equity-backed strategic counterparties, to gauge their interest in a potential transaction involving the
Company. The counterparties contacted by Goldman Sachs included all of the counterparties that had previously expressed an interest in a transaction with the Company that
the Strategy Committee, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, determined constituted or could constitute feasible counterparties and whose presence would aid
a transaction process, including by increasing competition. Private Equity Firm A and Party A, which had submitted the February 2018 Proposal, were invited to participate in
the process and informed that the Company would not otherwise be responding to the February 2018 Proposal.

            In furtherance of the Board's decision to reconstitute and further empower the Strategy Committee, the Strategy Committee's charter was amended and restated as of
April 5, 2018 (as so amended and restated, the "Amended and Restated Charter of the Strategy Committee") to modify the Strategy Committee's mandate, authority and
composition. Under its initial charter, the Strategy Committee's mandate was to review the Company's long-term strategic plan, strategies and all strategic transactions
available to the Company, as well as other related matters. Under the Amended and Restated Charter of the Strategy Committee, the Strategy Committee's mandate was
expanded to (i) explore the potential for one or more strategic transactions, including any sale, merger or business combination of the Company or any disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company, which might reasonably be in the best interests of the Company's shareholders; (ii) if no such strategic transaction existed or if
the Strategy Committee determined that no such strategic transaction is reasonably available or is in the best interests of the Company's shareholders, to work with Company
management on the Company's standalone plan to preserve and enhance shareholder value on a standalone basis; and (iii) if one or more strategic transactions could
reasonably be believed to be in the best interests of the Company's shareholders, then to negotiate the terms and conditions thereof on behalf of the Company. In furtherance
of this mandate, the Board empowered the Strategy Committee to, among other things: (1) oversee, review and evaluate communications, inquiries, expressions of interest
and proposals for a strategic transaction and enter into, negotiate and/or recommend confidentiality, standstill and related or similar agreements with such parties in
connection with any proposed strategic transaction; (2) review and evaluate the terms and conditions and determine the advisability of any strategic transaction and consider,
pursue and/or recommend any alternatives thereto; (3) negotiate the terms and conditions of any strategic transaction, including the terms and conditions of a definitive or
other agreement with respect thereto, or to negotiate any alternative thereto, and cause the Company to enter into agreements related thereto, subject to the approval by the
Board as may be required under applicable law; (4) conduct any investigation the Strategy Committee deems necessary or appropriate to fulfill its duties; and (5) make
recommendations to the Board with respect to whether the Strategy Committee believed any strategic transaction should be pursued or could be advisable and in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Strategy Committee was also authorized to

independently engage legal, financial and other advisors and consultants as appropriate to perform its duties under the Amended and Restated Charter. Furthermore, under
the Amended and Restated Charter of the Strategy Committee, if a member of the Strategy Committee or of the Board were to determine that a real or potential conflict of
interest exists for such member or any other member, such member shall disclose such real or potential conflict of interest to the other members of the Strategy Committee
and excuse himself or herself from the meeting, not take part in any discussions regarding such real or potential conflict of interest, and recuse himself or herself from voting
on matters that relate to such real or potential conflict of interest. At each meeting of the Strategy Committee (both before and after the Strategy Committee's charter was
restated), the members thereof met in various executive sessions with representatives of Company management, Goldman Sachs, William Blair (beginning on April 13, 2018)
and Latham and monitored and discussed any potential conflicts of interest of Advent, management, Goldman Sachs, William Blair or Latham with respect to potential
counterparties, as applicable. As part of this ongoing process, Mr. Maldonado would excuse himself from any discussion of potential conflicts relating to Advent. The Strategy
Committee did not find that any conflicts existed or materialized during the process that gave rise to any concern.

            On April 5, 2018, representatives of a potential counterparty ("Private Equity Firm E"), who was not at the time a participant in the transaction process, contacted
representatives of Goldman Sachs to express interest in a potential strategic transaction involving the Company, which Goldman Sachs promptly reported to the Strategy
Committee.

            On April 6, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham and
Goldman Sachs were present, to discuss the status of the process and preliminary feedback received on potential buyer interest. At this meeting representatives of Goldman
Sachs provided an overview of its relationships in the industry and with potential participants in a transaction. The members of the Strategy Committee determined that none
of the relationships summarized by representatives of Goldman Sachs would unduly impact its ability to serve as an advisor.

            On April 9, 2018, Mr. Williams contacted a representative of William Blair, which served as an underwriter in the Company's initial public offering and follow-on
offerings, about potentially serving as a financial advisor to the Strategy Committee in connection with a possible transaction, based on William Blair's expertise in the
healthcare and technology industries and William Blair's prior experience in mergers and acquisitions. Subsequently, on April 12, 2018, the Company entered into a
customary confidentiality agreement with William Blair in connection with the Strategy Committee's potential retention of William Blair as a financial advisor to the Strategy
Committee.

Also on April 9, 2018, Goldman Sachs was informed that Party A, Private Equity Firm A, Private Equity Firm B and a division of Private Equity Firm D were interested in
partnering as a single bidder (collectively, "Consortium A").

On April 11, 2018, Goldman Sachs was informed by two potential counterparties, "Private Equity Firm F" and "Party C" (which is backed by a private equity firm ("Private
Equity Firm G")), that they were interested in partnering together as a single bidder (collectively, "Consortium B").

On April 13, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham, Goldman Sachs
and William Blair were present, to discuss Goldman Sachs' outreach to various potential counterparties to a potential strategic transaction with the Company, including each
potential counterparty's level of interest, experience in the Company's industry and financial capacity. The Strategy Committee and members of Company management

discussed their views relating to inviting Private Equity Firm E and another potential counterparty ("Private Equity Firm H") into the evaluation process. The Strategy
Committee determined to invite Private Equity Firm E and Private Equity Firm H into the process in light of their deep industry expertise and financial capacity. The Strategy
Committee also discussed the mixes of consideration that the pool of potential counterparties could be expected to offer in a possible transaction, the inclusion of strategic
companies in the evaluation process and whether such companies' balance sheets would support an acquisition of a business with the Company's market value.

Between April 6, 2018 and April 19, 2018 the Company negotiated and entered into customary confidentiality agreements with each of Veritas Capital, Party A, Party C,
Private Equity Firm C, Private Equity Firm E, Private Equity Firm F, and two other potential counterparties ("Private Equity Firm I" and "Private Equity Firm J," respectively).
Other potential counterparties who had expressed interest in a potential transaction or who were previously contacted by Goldman Sachs at the direction of the Strategy
Committee, declined to participate in the process. Company management held introductory calls, attended by representatives of Goldman Sachs, with representatives of such
parties between April 12, 2018 and April 20, 2018 to provide an overview of the Company and its business.

On April 16, 2018, at the direction of the Strategy Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted representatives of Private Equity Firm H to invite Private Equity
Firm H to participate in the process. Private Equity Firm H declined to participate in the process on April 17, 2018.

On April 20, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham, Goldman Sachs
and William Blair were present, to discuss the outreach that Goldman Sachs had conducted to potential counterparties and the introductory management calls that had
occurred. A representative of Goldman Sachs noted that, other than the pre-approved groups of bidders, the potential counterparties (or groups of counterparties, including
Consortium A, Consortium B, and Party E and its private equity sponsor (collectively, "Consortium C")) were not permitted to partner with any other potential counterparties in
connection with the submission of their respective preliminary indications of interest, in order to foster competition and increase the Company's options in terms of selecting
the best possible strategic partner in a possible transaction. Latham then provided an update on the status of the negotiation of a confidentiality agreement with a potential
counterparty ("Party D") and reported that Party D would not agree to customary provisions of the confidentiality agreement, including a "standstill" provision. The Strategy
Committee instructed Goldman Sachs to convey to Party D the Company's views on the key terms of the confidentiality agreement. Following Goldman Sachs' discussion
with Party D, Party D subsequently chose not to resume its participation in the process. William Blair provided an overview of its relationships in the industry and with potential
participants in a transaction. The Strategy Committee and Latham reviewed the contents of William Blair's relationship disclosure letter. The members of the Strategy
Committee determined that none of the relationships summarized by William Blair would unduly impact its ability to serve as the Strategy Committee's financial advisor.
William Blair was asked to recommend to the Strategy Committee whether any additional potential counterparties should be invited to participate in the process.
Messrs. Williams and Ferguson also provided a status update on a proposed retention plan for certain employees of the Company in connection with the Company's process
in exploring a possible strategic transaction. Throughout the strategic review process, any and all decisions or actions related to retention plans were reviewed and authorized
by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee").

Between April 24, 2018 and April 26, 2018, at the direction of the Strategy Committee, Goldman Sachs provided the current market perspective on levels of leverage to each
of Consortium A, Consortium B, Veritas Capital, Private Equity Firm C, Private Equity Firm E, Private Equity Firm I, and Private Equity

Firm J in an effort to assist such parties with formulating their proposals. Goldman Sachs did not, however, offer to provide financing to any such party in connection with any
transaction.

On April 26, 2018, a representative of a potential counterparty ("Private Equity Firm K") called Mr. Maldonado to express Private Equity Firm K's interest in engaging in a
potential strategic transaction with the Company. Mr. Maldonado subsequently informed Goldman Sachs about Private Equity Firm K's expression of interest.

On April 27, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham, Goldman Sachs
and William Blair were present, during which representatives of William Blair provided an overview of the independent analysis they had undertaken in order to determine
whether the Strategy Committee should consider inviting any other potential counterparties to participate in the process. Representatives of William Blair noted that two
potential counterparties ("Private Equity Firm L" and "Private Equity Firm M," respectively), could constitute reasonable candidates for further outreach regarding a potential
strategic transaction based on, among other things, such parties' past investments in analogous businesses. Mr. Williams explained that Private Equity Firm L is a current
investor in a current bidder ("Party E"), and as such was indirectly involved in the bid process through its current investment. After a full discussion, it was the sense of the
Strategy Committee determined that there would be overlap with both Private Equity Firm L and Private Equity Firm M given the then-current mix of bidders, and that
including them in the process did not offer advantages that would outweigh the incremental risk of leaks.

Mr. Maldonado informed the other members of the Strategy Committee of his contact the previous day with Private Equity Firm K. The Strategy Committee members and
representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed that Private Equity Firm K had previously reviewed the Company in a prior transaction process involving iHealth
Technologies, Inc. (a predecessor entity of the Company), and consistently offered the lowest valuation for the Company out of all of the potential counterparties, and would
likely not be a competitive bidder. The Strategy Committee determined not to invite Private Equity Firm K to participate in the process. Representatives of Goldman Sachs
then provided an overview of the management presentations that had occurred. The Strategy Committee and Latham also discussed the viability of Consortium B as a
competitive bidder group.

That same day, the Compensation Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and a representative of Latham were present, to
discuss a proposed employee retention program in light of the Company's process in exploring a possible transaction involving the Company, and the risks to the Company of
departures associated with that information. Following discussion, the Compensation Committee approved a retention program. The Compensation Committee noted at that
time that an additional plan may be in the best interests of the Company's shareholders, but that the Compensation Committee would need to continue to evaluate such a
plan through the transaction process.

Also on April 27, 2018, the Company negotiated and entered into a customary confidentiality agreement with Party E.

Between April 19, 2018 and April 27, 2018, at the direction of the Strategy Committee, Goldman Sachs distributed a first round process letter to Veritas Capital, Consortium A,
Consortium B, Consortium C, Private Equity Firm C, Private Equity Firm E, Private Equity Firm I and Private Equity Firm J, requesting that such parties submit to Goldman
Sachs a non-binding written indication of interest regarding a potential acquisition of the Company by May 1, 2018.

On May 1, 2018, the Company received preliminary, non-binding proposals from six potential counterparties (or groups of counterparties) regarding an acquisition of all of the
shares of the Company. Private Equity Firm E proposed to acquire all of the outstanding equity of the Company at a per-share price of $39, to be financed with a combination
of debt and equity capital from a partnership between funds affiliated with Private Equity Firm E and a third-party source, and that Private Equity Firm E expected to provide
the Company's senior management with an equity rollover. Private Equity Firm E was the only bidder that explicitly stated a need to partner with a third-party equity financing
source. Veritas Capital proposed to acquire all of the outstanding equity of the Company at a per-share price in the range of $41 to $44, to be financed with a combination of
debt and equity capital from Veritas Capital. Veritas Capital would effectuate the acquisition through a combination of the Company and Verscend, a portfolio company of
Veritas Capital. Veritas Capital and Verscend's proposal did not propose a possible equity rollover or reinvestment by Company management. Consortium A proposed to
acquire all of the outstanding equity of the Company at a per-share price of $40 (an increase from the per-share price of $39 previously proposed in the February 2018
Proposal), requested a 14-day exclusivity period, and indicated that Company management would be offered the opportunity to reinvest in the combined business. The joint
proposal also indicated that the merger consideration would be financed with a combination of debt and equity capital from Private Equity Firm A and a fund managed by
Private Equity Firm B, and that the merger would be effectuated through a combination between the Company and Party A. Consortium C proposed to acquire all of the
outstanding equity of the Company at a per-share price of $44, to be financed with a combination of debt and equity capital from investors behind Party E, led by a fund
managed by Party E's private equity sponsor. Consortium C's proposal did not propose a possible equity rollover or reinvestment by Company management. Private Equity
Firm J proposed to acquire all of the outstanding equity of the Company at a per-share price of $41, to be financed with a combination of debt and equity capital from a fund
affiliated with Private Equity Firm J. Private Equity Firm J's proposal did not propose a possible equity rollover or reinvestment by Company management. Consortium B
proposed to acquire all of the outstanding equity of the Company at a per-share price in the range of $41 to $43, to be financed with a combination of debt and equity capital
from funds affiliated with Private Equity Firm F and Private Equity Firm G, and one or more large limited partners in existing funds. The proposal from Consortium B indicated
that the parties would effectuate the merger through a combination between the Company and Party C, and did not propose a possible equity rollover or reinvestment by
Company management. None of the proposals offered any different terms for Advent relative to all other shareholders of the Company. Of the potential counterparties then
remaining, Private Equity Firm C and Private Equity Firm I declined to submit proposals. Private Equity Firm C opted out because they believed that they were at a
competitive deficit relative to other perceived potential counterparties, and Private Equity Firm I had decided to focus its strategic efforts elsewhere. The closing price of the
common stock of the Company on May 1, 2018 was $34.94 per share.

On May 3, 2018, Company management, accompanied by representatives of Goldman Sachs, held an introductory call with representatives of Party E to provide an overview
of the Company and its business.

On May 4, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham, Goldman Sachs
and William Blair were present, to discuss the preliminary non-binding proposals submitted to the Company on May 1, 2018 and the per-share price offers reflected in the
proposals, which ranged from $39 to $44, and the premiums associated therewith. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and William Blair also provided their perspectives on
the preliminary proposals and the nature of the counterparties as potential transaction partners. Mr. Williams then provided an overview of his analysis of the preliminary
proposals in terms of potential strategic combination value and solutions synergies with each bidder having a strategic combination, and a preliminary view of the likelihood of
these proposed prices holding firm through further diligence. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then discussed that Private Equity Firm E offered the

lowest per-share price, and that Private Equity Firm E would likely require an additional equity financing source. The Strategy Committee determined, based on its review of
the risks and opportunities presented by the bidders' preliminary proposals, that all bidders other than Private Equity Firm E would be invited to participate in the next round.
Messrs. Wise and Williams confirmed that they informed the entire Board of the status of the indications of interest.

Between May 7, 2018 and May 10, 2018, Company management conducted in-person due diligence meetings with representatives of Consortium A, Veritas Capital and
Verscend, Consortium C, Private Equity Firm B and Consortium B. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and William Blair were present for the presentation.

Between May 11, 2018 and May 25, 2018, the Company provided the remaining bidders with access to its online data room.

On May 11, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham, Goldman Sachs
and William Blair were present. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and William Blair provided an overview of the Company management presentations with the bidders that
had occurred to date. A representative of Latham then reviewed the key terms of the transaction agreements to be distributed as part of the auction, and noted that Latham
had received input from the management and the Board.

Also on May 11, 2018, at the direction of Company management, Goldman Sachs provided each of the remaining bidders who had submitted requests for financing sources
with consent to engage with such financing sources.

On May 14, 2018, the Company negotiated and entered into a confidentiality agreement with Verscend.

On May 15, 2018, a representative of an investment bank ("Bank B") called Mr. Maldonado on behalf of a potential counterparty ("Party F") to express Party F's interest in
participating in a possible strategic transaction involving the Company. The representative of Bank B indicated to Mr. Maldonado that Party F would need a period of time to
arrange the required financing if it were to participate in such a transaction. Mr. Maldonado subsequently informed Mr. Olefson and Goldman Sachs of his contact with Party
F, and this was promptly reported to the Strategy Committee.

Between May 15, 2018 through May 25, 2018, the Company negotiated and entered into customary clean team confidentiality agreements with each of Veritas Capital, Party
C, Party E and Private Equity Firm F, and opened the "clean room" of the Company's online data room, in order to share additional highly confidential information of the
Company with a limited pool of recipients.

Between May 16, 2018 and June 13, 2018, representatives of Company management held various due diligence and business calls with Consortium A, Consortium B,
Consortium C, Veritas Capital and Verscend, and Private Equity Firm J. Representatives of Goldman Sachs were in attendance for each of the calls.

On May 18, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting (without Mr. Maldonado, who could not attend), at which members of Company management and
representatives of each of Latham, Goldman Sachs and William Blair were present. Mr. Olefson informed the Strategy Committee of Bank B's contact with Mr. Maldonado on
behalf of Party F. Following discussion of the nature of Party F's outreach and its need for additional time and financing, the Strategy Committee determined not to invite Party
F to participate in the process at that time. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then provided an update on the management meetings and due diligence process to date. A

summarized the key terms of the auction draft of the merger agreement that Latham had drafted in preparation for a possible strategic transaction. The Strategy Committee
also discussed a potential compensation plan for certain senior-level employees in connection with the Company's exploration of a potential transaction in order to ensure
retention through closing, as well as the risks associated with the potential nonrenewal of certain of the Company's contracts.

On May 19, 2018, Mr. Williams spoke with a representative of Private Equity Firm A and Party A (members of Consortium A) regarding Party A's practice of targeting and
attempting to hire employees of the Company. During that discussion, the representative of Private Equity Firm A and Party A told Mr. Williams that Consortium A had decided
to no longer continue in the process in any event.

On May 20, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a special telephonic meeting, at which a representative of Latham was present, to discuss the decision of Consortium A to no
longer continue in the process. The Strategy Committee determined that Mr. Williams, along with Mr. Swift, should contact Consortium A to reaffirm that it was welcome to
remain in the process, notwithstanding Party A's attempts to solicit Company employees. During that call, Consortium A reaffirmed that it did not desire to continue in the
process.

At the direction of the Strategy Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs also contacted representatives of Consortium A, and Consortium A explained that it did not
desire to continue in the process primarily due to an impression of an inability to pay enough to outbid other potential strategic buyers. Notwithstanding Consortium A's desire
to not continue in the process, on May 22, 2018, a representative of Private Equity Firm B called a representative of Goldman Sachs and separately Mr. Maldonado to
express an interest in pursuing an acquisition of the Company on a standalone basis, independent of Consortium A.

Also on May 23, 2018, the Compensation Committee held an in-person meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of Latham and AON plc,
the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, were present, to discuss, among other things, the retention of key employees and executives in light of
a possible transaction involving the Company. The Compensation Committee discussed the fact that retention plans could be an important tool in incentivizing management
to work towards closing a transaction, even if management would not have a long-term role with the Company after the closing.

On May 24, 2018, the Board held a regularly-scheduled in-person meeting, with members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham, Goldman Sachs,
and William Blair present. The Board broadly discussed the status of the process, the terms of the proposed definitive transaction documentation, the desire to assess
potential synergies from counterparties that might indicate an ability to pay more in the process, and whether to consider potentially acquiring any of the parties that had failed
to continue in the process (to which the Board reaffirmed its desire to continue with the process). The Board also discussed whether there were any potential conflicts of
interest and determined that no conflicts of interest existed that would adversely impact the process or the independence of the members of the Board. The Board discussed
the importance of being efficient in the process to maintain leverage and avoid distraction. The Board also discussed the recent departure of Private Equity Firm B from
Consortium A, and the interest of Private Equity Firm B in entering the process without the rest of that consortium, which the Board supported after careful analysis,
consideration and discussion. The Strategy Committee noted that all members of the Board continued to be welcome to join the regular Strategy Committee teleconferences
and/or to confer about status of the process.

standalone basis as a result of its prior participation with Consortium A, and the Company subsequently negotiated and entered into a confidentiality agreement with Private
Equity Firm B.

On May 31, 2018, representatives of Party C met with representatives of the Company to discuss potential synergies.

On June 1, 2018, at the direction of the Strategy Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs made available to the prospective bidders an initial auction draft of the
merger agreement and related disclosure schedules prepared by Latham for an acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of the Company. At the direction of the Strategy
Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs also distributed a second round process letter to Veritas Capital and Verscend, Consortium C and Private Equity Firm B,
requesting that mark-ups of the auction draft of the merger agreement and related disclosure schedules be submitted by June 15, 2018 and that definitive, binding proposals
be submitted by June 21, 2018. Also on June 1, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives
of each of Latham, Goldman Sachs and William Blair were present, to discuss the due diligence process to date. Mr. Williams then provided his perspective with respect to
potential synergies between the Company and the remaining bidders so that the Strategy Committee could further assess the ability of bidders to pay additional
consideration.

The Strategy Committee and representatives of Goldman Sachs also discussed Private Equity Firm J's ability to finance a transaction with the Company on a standalone
basis, as well as the possibility of Private Equity Firm J teaming with a strategic buyer.

On June 5, 2018, a news article relating to the process was published, based on unnamed sources, suggesting that the Company was in advanced stages of exploring a sale.
The closing price of the common stock of the Company rose from $33.95 per share on June 4, 2018 (the last day before the news article was published) to $39.87 on June 5,
2018.

On June 8, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting (without Mr. Parisi, who was unable to attend), at which Elizabeth Connolly Alexander, Vice Chair of the
Board, members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham, Goldman Sachs and William Blair were present. Representatives of Goldman Sachs
provided an update on the due diligence process to date, including with respect to the diligence calls and meetings between Company management and bidders that had
occurred over the course of the week. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also noted that Consortium B had decelerated its due diligence efforts and was no longer expected
to submit a bid in connection with a potential strategic transaction with the Company. Mr. Williams then discussed the June 5, 2018 article.

On June 14, 2018, representatives of Party E separately contacted Mr. Williams and representatives of Goldman Sachs to indicate that they were no longer interested in
proceeding with a potential transaction with the Company.

On June 15, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of Company management and representatives of each of Goldman Sachs, William Blair
and Latham present, to discuss the status of the process and next steps. The Strategy Committee and Latham reviewed the Strategy Committee's and the Board's continuing
roles, responsibilities and fiduciary duties in respect of a potential transaction. The Strategy Committee reminded Company management that there should be no discussions
between Company management and potential counterparties regarding employment or compensation in connection with any possible transaction until after a definitive
agreement had been executed, if any.

Also on June 15, 2018, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP ("Skadden"), Verscend's outside legal counsel, submitted mark-ups of the merger agreement and related
disclosure schedules, as requested by the second round process letter.

Later that afternoon, representatives of Private Equity Firm B contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs and each of Mr. Williams and Mr. Maldonado to preview with them
that, in lieu of only providing a revised draft of the merger agreement, Private Equity Firm B would be delivering a "complete" acquisition proposal at a price of $40.50 per
share, which was an accelerated, preemptive bid before the established process bid date. Private Equity Firm B indicated that $40.50 per share was its best price and an
improvement over the $40 per-share price that Consortium A had offered as part of that consortium's preliminary proposal. Representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed that
Private Equity Firm B reiterated that $40.50 per share represented its best offer after representatives of Goldman Sachs probed representatives of Private Equity Firm B on
price.

Shortly thereafter, representatives of Private Equity Firm B submitted a proposal, which Private Equity Firm B characterized as its "final proposal," to acquire 100% of the
outstanding stock of the Company for $40.50 per fully diluted common share in cash, together with a mark-up of the auction draft of the merger agreement and related
disclosure schedules, executed debt and equity financing commitment letters, a limited guaranty in favor of the Company, and a form of voting agreement to be executed by
certain shareholders of the Company. Private Equity Firm B's offer was also contingent on executing a definitive agreement by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on June 17, 2018, at
which time the offer would expire and Private Equity Firm B would no longer pursue the proposed transaction.

That evening, the Strategy Committee (without Mr. Maldonado, who was unable to attend) held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and
representatives of each of Goldman Sachs, William Blair, Latham, and RLF, were present, to discuss Private Equity Firm B's final proposal and Verscend's mark-up of the
merger agreement and related disclosure schedules. The Strategy Committee discussed the contrast between the mark-ups submitted by each of Verscend and Private
Equity Firm B, and characterized Private Equity Firm B's mark-up as providing greater shareholder certainty. The Strategy Committee discussed that condensing the timeline
was in the best interest of the Company's shareholders, and that in order to maximize optionality and value for the Company's shareholders, the Company should notify
Veritas Capital and Verscend that the process timing had accelerated and if they wanted to have a chance to acquire the Company, they would need to deliver a complete
and significantly improved proposal by the morning of June 17, 2018 (rather than on June 21, 2018). Messrs. Wise and Olefson subsequently briefed the other members of
the Board about the Strategy Committee's determination.

Later that evening, at the direction of the Strategy Committee, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted Veritas Capital and requested that it and Verscend submit an
improved mark-up of the merger agreement and a "complete" proposal, together with its best possible price, for consideration by the Board.

On June 16, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Goldman Sachs, William
Blair, Latham and RLF were present. Latham provided an overview of the key issues raised by each of Private Equity Firm B's and Verscend's mark-ups of the Company's
auction draft of the merger agreement. It was determined that further engagement with both Private Equity Firm B and Verscend would be advantageous to the process.

Later that day, Latham held telephone conferences with outside legal counsel for each of Verscend and Private Equity Firm B to discuss their mark-ups of the merger
agreement and related documentation. Latham indicated the importance of certainty in evaluating the relative offers.

The afternoon of June 16, 2018, the Compensation Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company management and a representative of Latham were
present, to discuss potential transaction bonus payments to senior management in light of a possible transaction involving the Company. The Compensation Committee
meeting was adjourned without any such awards being granted at that time.

The evening of June 16, 2018, Private Equity Firm B's outside legal counsel circulated to representatives of Latham revised drafts of the merger agreement and related
documentation.

The morning of June 17, 2018, representatives of Veritas Capital delivered a complete proposal, including revised drafts of the merger agreement and related disclosure
schedules, as well as debt, equity, and preferred equity commitment letters, to Goldman Sachs. Verscend proposed to acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock of the Company for a purchase price per share in cash of $44.50, requested a two business day exclusivity period to finalize definitive documentation, and
indicated that Verscend would expect to enter into a customary voting agreement with Advent. Neither Verscend's nor Private Equity Firm B's bid included a management
rollover condition or any different terms for Advent relative to all other shareholders of the Company.

Later in the morning of June 17, 2018, the Strategy Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which Mr. Swift, members of Company management and representatives of each
of Goldman Sachs, William Blair, Latham and RLF were present, to discuss Verscend's bid. Latham reviewed Verscend's revised proposal, and specifically the revised merger
agreement, noting that Verscend had removed or modified to the benefit of the Company certain key provisions from its earlier mark-up of the merger agreement relating to
certainty of closing, including, among others, by removing an appraisal condition and absence of litigation condition, accepting a general "hell or high water" antitrust
divestiture obligation, and removing a requirement that closing conditions be satisfied prior to the commencement of its marketing efforts to obtain debt financing.

Shortly after the meeting, Latham circulated revised drafts of the merger agreement and ancillary documentation to Private Equity Firm B's outside legal counsel.

Later in the day of June 17, 2018, the Board held a special telephonic meeting (without Ms. Alexander, who was unable to attend), at which members of Company
management and representatives of each of Goldman Sachs, William Blair, Latham and RLF were present, to discuss the Strategy Committee's review of strategic
alternatives, and in particular the Strategy Committee's evaluation of the acquisition proposals submitted by Verscend and Private Equity Firm B. Mr. Olefson confirmed that
he had briefed Ms. Alexander regarding recent developments. Latham reviewed with the members of the Board their fiduciary duties, including in the context of a strategic
transaction, various process alternatives, and conflict monitoring and mitigation approaches. During this meeting, on behalf of the Strategy Committee, Mr. Wise briefed the
Board on the dynamics, risks and opportunities in the process, actions the Strategy Committee had taken to maximize value for all shareholders, actions the Strategy
Committee took to monitor and address any perceived conflicts of interest, and the views of the members of the Strategy Committee that it would be in the best interest of the
Company's shareholders to continue to push forward with Verscend's bid, and to negotiate for improved economic and legal terms in the transaction documentation. The
members of the Board determined that the Board was in unanimous agreement with the Strategy Committee's views. The Board unanimously agreed that Goldman Sachs,

Latham should continue to evaluate Verscend's proposal, seek increased consideration for all of the Company's shareholders, and provide feedback on the transaction
documents, consistent with the approach discussed with the Board.

Later on June 17, 2018, representatives of Latham contacted Skadden to provide feedback on Verscend's mark-up of certain key terms and conditions of the merger
agreement, particularly focused on provisions relating to certainty of closing. In response to continued negotiations for additional value, a representative of Veritas Capital
indicated to representatives of Goldman Sachs that Verscend would be willing to increase its price from $44.50 to $44.75 per share, which Veritas Capital characterized as
Verscend's best and final offer.

The evening of June 17, 2018, the Board (except for Ms. Alexander, who was unable to attend) convened a second special meeting, at which members of Company
management and representatives of each of Goldman Sachs, William Blair, Latham and RLF were present. Latham summarized discussions with Skadden on key terms and
conditions in the merger agreement and informed the Board that Skadden had delivered a draft exclusivity agreement to Latham in connection with Verscend's final bid. The
meeting participants then discussed Verscend's revised price, including in comparison to the current trading price, the stock price prior to the publication of the June 5, 2018
article, and the Company's 52-week high closing stock price of $44.60 per share. The Board also discussed with its financial advisors that no additional offers or indications of
interest had been received following the publication of the June 5, 2018 article. Following such discussion, the Board approved of the Company's entry into a 24-hour
exclusivity period with Verscend to allow the advisors to finalize the terms and the transaction documents. Mr. Williams also confirmed that Company management would
refrain from engaging in compensation discussions with Verscend until authorized by the Board to do so.

Following the meeting, the Company executed (i) an engagement letter with each of Goldman Sachs and William Blair and (ii) an exclusivity agreement with Verscend
granting it exclusivity until 9:00 PM Eastern Time on June 18, 2018, in each case, on the terms presented to the Board.

The morning of June 18, 2018, Latham sent revised drafts of the merger agreement and related documentation to Skadden, including a draft voting agreement. Latham and
Skadden continued to negotiate and exchange revised drafts of all of the transaction documentation throughout the day.

Shortly following the expiration of Verscend's exclusivity period on June 18, 2018, Private Equity Firm B contacted Goldman Sachs to re-engage in the transaction process
and indicated that it was prepared to increase its offer from $40.50 per share to $41.50 per share, and that such amount represented its best and final price. Messrs. Wise
and Maldonado discussed with representatives of Goldman Sachs whether there was a realistic possibility of Private Equity Firm B presenting a further superior proposal
above $44.75 per share, and representatives of Goldman Sachs advised that in its reasoned judgment and experience, along with the fact that Private Equity Firm B had
stated that it was not able to further increase the price, it was unlikely that further negotiation would result in a higher offer from Private Equity Firm B. The Company extended
Verscend's exclusivity period until 7:00 AM Eastern Time the following morning, in an effort to continue negotiations with Verscend and Veritas Capital toward a possible
transaction at a price of $44.75 per share.

Over the course of the evening of June 18, 2018, Latham and Skadden continued to negotiate the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The Board also convened a
special meeting on June 18, 2018, at which members of Company management and representatives of each of Latham, Goldman Sachs, William Blair and RLF were
present, for a status update on Latham's negotiation of the transaction documentation with Skadden. Mr. Olefson confirmed that he briefed Ms. Alexander regarding recent

developments earlier that day. At this meeting, representatives of each of Goldman Sachs and William Blair described in detail the process that their respective firms used to
evaluate the fairness of the consideration to be paid by Verscend in the proposed transaction.

On the morning of June 19, 2018, prior to commencement of trading hours, the Compensation Committee held a telephonic meeting, at which members of Company
management and a representative of Latham were present, to discuss the potential transaction bonuses to senior management under consideration by the Compensation
Committee. Following discussion, the Compensation Committee resolved to recommend to the Board that the Board approve a form of transaction bonus agreement in
connection with the grant of transaction bonuses to certain members of senior management in order to incentivize them to remain with the Company to execute the closing,
noting, in addition, that the Company (and Company management) and Verscend had no substantive discussion to date regarding plans, including retention and other
employment related matters, for Company management following consummation of the Merger.

Shortly after the Compensation Committee meeting on June 19, 2018, the Board convened a special meeting, at which all members of the Board, certain members of
Company management and representatives of each of Latham, Goldman Sachs, William Blair and RLF were present. The Board discussed the key terms of the merger
agreement that had been negotiated since the previous meeting of the Board. Representatives of each of Goldman Sachs and William Blair then informed the Board that
there were no changes from the valuation analyses described during the June 18, 2018 Board meeting. Representatives of each of Goldman Sachs and William Blair then
rendered to the Board the separate oral opinions of their respective firms (which were subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of written opinions dated June 19, 2018)
that, as of June 19, 2018 and based on and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in the written opinions, the $44.75 in cash per share to be paid by Verscend to
the holders (other than Verscend and its affiliates) of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company's
shareholders. The Board discussed the proposed transaction and the presentations and, following such discussion, the Board determined that it would be far more favorable
for the Company's shareholders to accept $44.75 per share, which represented a significant premium to the Company's trading price before news reports suggested the
Company was engaged in a transaction process, than to continue as a standalone public company or continue other alternatives. The Board unanimously (i) adopted the
Merger Agreement and approved the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (ii) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, (iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of the Merger Agreement, (iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of our stockholders and (v) resolved to make the
Company Recommendation. The Board also approved transaction bonus awards for certain executives of the Company. A more detailed description of such transaction
bonuses is included under the section entitled "Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Cotiviti in the Merger—Director and Executive Officer Compensation
Agreements" of this proxy statement.

The morning of June 19, 2018, before the commencement of trading hours, the Company and Verscend executed the merger agreement, finalized the related documentation,
and issued a joint press release announcing the transaction.

thereby, including the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of Cotiviti and its stockholders and unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger and
unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal and "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal.

On June 19, 2018, the Board unanimously (i) adopted the Merger Agreement and approved the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (ii) determined that
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Cotiviti and our stockholders,
(iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by Cotiviti of the Merger Agreement, (iv) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of
our stockholders and (v) resolved to make the Company Recommendation.

In recommending that our stockholders vote their shares of our Common Stock in favor of the Merger Proposal, the Board considered a number of reasons, including the
following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):

• Attractive Value. The Board's belief that the Merger Consideration represents an attractive value for the shares of our Common Stock, taking into account the
Board's familiarity with our business, operations, assets, operating results, financial condition, prospects and business strategy, and the Board's belief, based on
the course and history of the negotiations between Verscend and Cotiviti, that the Merger Consideration represented the highest consideration that Verscend
was willing to pay. 

• Best Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value. The Board considered that the Merger Consideration was more favorable to our stockholders than the
potential value that might result from other alternatives reasonably available to Cotiviti, including the potential stockholder value based on our business plan that
could be expected to be generated from remaining an independent public company, the possibility of being acquired by other companies, the possibility of
acquisitions or mergers with other companies and other transactions, as well as the potential benefits, risks and uncertainties associated with such alternatives. 

• Timing. The Board considered current market activity and timing for the Company to explore a potential strategic transaction in light of recent trends toward
industry consolidation. The Board concluded that it was an opportune time for the Company to consider a sale of the Company in light of these market trends
and in order to capitalize on the numerous indications of interest that were received by the Board and the Company. 

• Risks Relating to Remaining a Stand-Alone Company. The Board reviewed our business, operations, assets, operating results, financial condition, prospects,
business strategy, competitive position, and industry, including the potential impact (which cannot be quantified numerically) of those factors on the trading price
of our Common Stock, to assess the prospects and risks associated with remaining an independent, stand-alone public company. The Board believed that the
acquisition of Cotiviti by Verscend for $44.75 per share in cash was more favorable to our stockholders than the value of remaining an independent public
company, after accounting for the risks and uncertainties associated with achieving and executing upon our business and financial plans in the short- and long-
term as a stand-alone company. 

• Certainty of Value. The Merger Consideration consists solely of cash, which provides immediate liquidity and certainty of value to our stockholders compared to
remaining an independent stand-alone company or any transaction in which our stockholders would

receive shares of an acquirer's stock. The Board weighed the certainty of realizing a compelling value for shares of our Common Stock by virtue of the Merger
against the uncertain prospect that the trading value for our Common Stock would approach the per share Merger Consideration in the foreseeable future, as
well as the risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those described above, as well as the other risks and uncertainties discussed in
Cotiviti's public filings with the SEC. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" of this proxy statement.

• Historical Value. The Board considered the value represented by the Merger Consideration compared against the current and historical trading prices of our
Common Stock, including the market performance of our Common Stock relative to those of other participants in Cotiviti's industry and general market indices,
and the fact that the Merger Consideration represented a premium of approximately 12.2% over the Cotiviti common stock closing price of $39.89 per share on
June 18, 2018, the last trading day before the public announcement that Cotiviti entered into the Merger Agreement, and a premium of approximately 31.8%
over the Common Stock closing price of $33.95 per share on June 4, 2018 (the last day before news reports suggested that the Company was engaged in a
transaction process). 

• Comprehensive Review Process. The Board considered the fact that the Board consisted of a majority of independent directors who unanimously approved the
transaction following extensive discussions with Cotiviti's management team, representatives of financial advisers and outside legal counsel and a
comprehensive strategic review and transaction process undertaken by the Board's Strategy Committee, and also took into consideration the financial expertise
and prior industry experience held by a number of directors. In particular, the Board contacted or responded to inbound interest from the most feasible potential
strategic and financial buyers (underscored by the fact that no new potential buyers came forward following news reports suggesting that the Company was
engaged in a transaction process) and engaged in an extensive competitive transaction and due diligence process with multiple potential buyers. 

• Ability to Respond to Acquisition Proposals. The Board considered the "fiduciary out" provisions of the Merger Agreement, which, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, permit Cotiviti to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with third parties that make Acquisition Proposals under certain
circumstances, to change its recommendation to stockholders regarding the Merger Agreement and to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to approve a
Superior Proposal, subject to payment of a termination fee in favor of Verscend. The Board further considered the fact that the $100.0 million termination fee
(approximately 2.0% of the transaction value) payable by Cotiviti (i) is reasonable in light of the overall terms of the Merger Agreement and the benefits of the
Merger and (ii) would not preclude another party from making a competing proposal. 

• Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board considered all of the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including the structure of the transaction, the
all-cash form of the Merger Consideration, the limited scope of the conditions to closing and the customary nature of the representations, warranties, and the
covenants and agreements of the parties. The Board further considered the course and nature of negotiations with Verscend, which were conducted at arm's
length and during which the Strategy Committee and the Board were advised by independent legal and financial advisors. These negotiations ultimately
resulted in terms that (i) provide for a significant premium over the trading price of our Common Stock and (ii) provide robust provisions to increase certainty of
the consummation of the Merger,

absent certain prohibitive events or the submission of a Superior Proposal. The Board believed, based on these negotiations, that these were the most
favorable terms available to Cotiviti and our stockholders on which Verscend, or an alternative purchaser, would be willing to transact.

• Voting Agreements. The Board viewed favorably the willingness of certain stockholders, who together hold approximately 44% of the shares of our Common
Stock outstanding as of the date of the Merger Agreement, to commit to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal by entry into the Voting Agreement. The Board
also considered the fact that the Voting Agreement terminates upon an Adverse Recommendation Change by the Board and upon any termination of the
Merger Agreement, including upon Cotiviti's termination to accept a Superior Proposal, such that the existence of the Voting Agreement would not be likely to
deter or inhibit a Superior Proposal. 

• Fairness Opinions. The financial analyses presented to the Board by Goldman Sachs and William Blair and the opinions of Goldman Sachs and William Blair
rendered to the Board to the effect that, as of June 19, 2018 and based on and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs' and William
Blair's written opinions, respectively, the $44.75 in cash per share to be paid to the holders (other than Verscend and its affiliates) of the shares of Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. For more information, see the sections entitled "The Merger—
Fairness Opinion of Cotiviti's Financial Advisor: Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC" and "The Merger—Fairness Opinion of Cotiviti's Financial Advisor: William Blair &
Company, L.L.C." of this proxy statement. 

• Likelihood of Consummation. The likelihood that the Merger will be consummated, based on, among other things, the limited number of conditions to the
Merger, the absence of a financing condition, the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals, the remedies available under the Merger
Agreement to Cotiviti in the event of various breaches by Verscend, and Verscend's and Veritas Capital's reputations, their financial capacity to complete an
acquisition of this size and their prior track record of successfully completing acquisitions, which the Board believed supported the conclusion that a transaction
with Verscend could be completed relatively quickly and in an orderly manner. 

• Stockholder Approval; Appraisal Rights. The Board considered that the Merger would be subject to the approval of our stockholders, that stockholders would be
free to reject the Merger, other than those who entered into the Voting Agreement, and that stockholders who do not vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and
who follow certain prescribed procedures are entitled to dissent from the Merger and receive the appraised fair value of their shares, as provided under
Delaware law.

The Board also considered and balanced against the potentially positive factors a number of uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative factors in its deliberations
concerning the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):

• No Stockholder Participation in Future Earnings or Growth. The Board considered the fact that Cotiviti will no longer exist as an independent company, and
accordingly, our stockholders will no longer participate in any future growth Cotiviti may experience or any potential future appreciation in the value of shares of
our Common Stock, and will not participate in any potential future sale of Cotiviti's business to a third party.

Table of Contents

• Inability to Solicit Other Takeover Proposals. The Board considered that the Merger Agreement includes a covenant prohibiting Cotiviti from directly or indirectly
soliciting, initiating, seeking or knowingly facilitating or encouraging any inquiry, discussion, offer or request relating to, or that constitutes, or would reasonably
be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Board also considered, but did not consider preclusive, the fact that the right afforded to Verscend under
the Merger Agreement to re-negotiate the terms of the Merger Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal may discourage other parties that might otherwise
have an interest in a business combination with, or an acquisition of, Cotiviti. 

• Transaction Process. In exchange for restricting the time frame and scope of its market check, the Board negotiated more favorable terms for Cotiviti and, in
light of the improved terms and attractive price agreed to by Verscend, determined that proceeding with the Merger was in the best interests of our stockholders.
Accordingly, though the Merger Agreement permits Cotiviti to consider unsolicited proposals, the Board considered the fact that Cotiviti's ability to actively
market itself was and will be restricted. 

• Termination Fee. The Board considered the fact that Cotiviti may be required to pay a termination fee of $100.0 million (approximately 2.0% of the transaction
value) if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including to accept a Superior Proposal, and that the amount of the termination fee is
comparable to termination fees in transactions of a similar size, was reasonable, would not likely deter competing bids and would not likely be required to be
paid unless Cotiviti entered into a more favorable transaction. The Board also recognized that the provisions in the Merger Agreement relating to these fees
were insisted upon by Verscend as a condition to entering into the Merger Agreement. 

• Effect of Public Announcement. The Board considered the effect of the public announcement of Cotiviti entering into the Merger Agreement on our operations,
including our relationships with customers, vendors and employees, as well as our ability to attract and retain key personnel while the proposed transaction is
pending and the potential adverse effects on our financial results as a result of that disruption, as well as the possibility of any suit, action or proceeding in
respect of the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. 

• Opportunity Costs and Interim Operating Covenants. The Board considered that the focus and resources of our management may become diverted from other
important business opportunities and operational matters while working to implement the Merger, which could adversely affect our business. The Board also
considered the restrictions on the conduct of our business during the pendency of the Merger, which may delay or prevent Cotiviti from undertaking potential
business opportunities that may arise or may negatively affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. 

• Risk the Merger May Not Be Consummated. The Board considered the fact that consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing
conditions that are not within our control, including receipt of the necessary regulatory clearances and approvals and that no Company Material Adverse Effect
on Cotiviti has occurred. There can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties' obligations to consummate the Merger will be satisfied, and as a result, it
is possible that the Merger may not be consummated even if the Merger is approved by our stockholders. The Board considered the fact that if the Merger is not
consummated (i) we will have incurred significant transaction and opportunity costs,

including the possibility of disruption to our operations, diversion of management and employee attention, employee attrition and a potentially negative effect on
our business and customer relationships; (ii) the trading price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected; and (iii) the market's perceptions of our
prospects could be adversely affected.

• Transaction Costs. The Board considered the fact that we have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in connection with
the Merger, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated. 

• Potential Differing Interests of Directors and Officers. The Board considered the risk that certain of our directors and executive officers may have interests in the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, as individuals that are in addition to, or that may be different from, the interests of
our stockholders. See the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers of Cotiviti in the Merger" of this proxy statement. 

• Tax Treatment. The Board considered the fact that the Merger will be a taxable transaction to our stockholders that are U.S. Holders for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; and, therefore, such stockholders generally will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on any gains they recognize as a result of the Merger.

The Board believed that, overall, the risks and uncertainties associated with the Merger were outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger to our stockholders.

The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but summarizes the material factors considered by the Board. In light of the
variety of factors considered in connection with their evaluation of the Merger, the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights
to the specific factors considered in reaching their determinations and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Board applied his or her own personal business
judgment to the process and may have given different weight to different factors. The Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor, or
any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determinations. The Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented,
including thorough discussions with, and questioning of, our senior management and outside financial advisor and legal counsel. The Board unanimously recommends that
you vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal. It should be noted that this explanation of the reasoning of the Board and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking
in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" of this proxy statement.

and assistance of the Board in connection with its consideration of the proposed transaction and the opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how
any holder of shares of Common Stock should vote with respect to the proposed transaction or any other matter.

In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

• the Merger Agreement;
• annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the two years ended December 31, 2017;
• the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the prospectus contained therein dated May 25, 2016 relating to the shares of Common Stock;
• certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company;
• certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders;
• certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and
• certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for Goldman Sachs' use by the Company, which

are referred to as the "Company Forecasts" and which are summarized under the section entitled "Certain Financial Forecasts" of this proxy statement.

Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations,
financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the shares of Common Stock; compared certain financial and
stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of
certain recent business combinations in the healthcare information technology industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and
considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Board, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal,
regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, Goldman Sachs, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification
thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the Board that the Company Forecasts had been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and
liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs was not
furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation
of the proposed transaction would be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the proposed transaction in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs assumed that the proposed transaction would be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any
term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.

Goldman Sachs' opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the proposed transaction, or the relative merits of the proposed
transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may have been available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters.
Goldman Sachs' opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Verscend and its affiliates) of shares of Common Stock, as of

contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the proposed transaction, including, the fairness of the proposed transaction to, or any

amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the
proposed transaction, whether relative to the $44.75 in cash per share to be paid to the holders (other than Verscend and its affiliates) of shares of Common Stock pursuant
to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the impact of the proposed transaction on the solvency or viability of Company or
Verscend or the ability of the Company or Verscend to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs's opinion was necessarily based on economic,
monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of the date of its opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no
responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of the opinion. Goldman Sachs's

The results of these calculations are as follows:

Goldman Sachs calculated the implied equity value of the Company, which is referred to as the "Implied Equity Value," by multiplying the $44.75 per share of Merger
Consideration to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement by the total number of fully diluted shares of Common Stock outstanding as of June 15, 2018, taking into account
the Company's outstanding equity awards that are expected to vest as a result of the proposed transaction, calculated using information provided by the Company's
management. Goldman Sachs then calculated the implied enterprise value for the Company, which is referred to as the "Implied Enterprise Value," by adding to the Implied
Equity Value the Company's net debt (defined for this purpose as the Company's debt less cash) as of March 31, 2018, as set forth in the Company's public filings.

Using that information, Goldman Sachs calculated the following with respect to the Company:

• the Implied Enterprise Value as a multiple of the Company's earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based
compensation expense, or "Adjusted EBITDA," for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2018, which is referred to as "LTM Adjusted EBITDA," as provided
by the Company's management;

• the Implied Enterprise Value as a multiple of the estimates of the Adjusted EBITDA of the Company for 2018 and 2019, as reflected in the Company Forecasts;
• the $44.75 per share of Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement as a multiple of the estimates of the earnings per share, adjusted by

adding back tax-affected amortization and stock-based compensation expenses, or "Adjusted EPS," of the Company for 2018 and 2019, as reflected in the
Company Forecasts;

• the Implied Enterprise Value as a multiple of the median analyst estimate of the Adjusted EBITDA of the Company for 2018 and 2019, as published by The
Institutional Brokers' Estimate System, or " I/B/E/S" as of June 15, 2018; and

• the $44.75 per share of Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement as a multiple of the median analyst estimate of the Adjusted EPS of
the Company for 2018 and 2019, as published by I/B/E/S as of June 15, 2018.

Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analyses

Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Common Stock as of March 31, 2018, based on theoretical
future prices calculated by Goldman Sachs for the shares of Common Stock.

Using the Company Forecasts, Goldman Sachs derived a range of theoretical future values per share of Common Stock as of December 31 of each year starting 2018
through 2021, by applying a range of illustrative multiples of share price / EPS for the next twelve-month period, which is referred to as "NTM EPS," of 18.0x to 22.0x to an
estimate of the Company's Adjusted EPS for the following year, as reflected in the Company Forecasts. The range of illustrative multiples was derived by Goldman Sachs
utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the historical average share price/NTM EPS multiples for the Company over the period from July 14,
2016, the first day that NTM EPS estimates for the Company were published by I/B/E/S, and ended June 4, 2018, the last completed trading day before the first reported
rumor of a potential acquisition of the Company as well as over the three month, six month and one year periods ended June 4, 2018. Using a discount rate of 8.5%,
reflecting an estimate of the Company's cost of equity, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of March 31, 2018, the range of theoretical future values per share of
Common Stock it derived as of December 31 of each year

starting 2018 through 2021. Goldman Sachs derived the discount rate of 8.5% that it used by application of the capital asset pricing model, which requires certain company-
specific inputs, including a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. These calculations yielded a range of
illustrative present values per share of Common Stock of $36.10 to $53.90.

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analyses

Using the Company Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the Company to derive a range of illustrative present values per
share of Common Stock as of March 31, 2018.

Using discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.0%, reflecting estimates of the Company's weighted average cost of capital, and a mid-year convention, Goldman Sachs derived
a range of illustrative enterprise values for the Company as of March 31, 2018, by discounting to present value as of March 31, 2018 (a) the estimates of the unlevered free
cash flow to be generated by the Company for the period from April 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022, as reflected in the Company Forecasts, and (b) a range of illustrative
terminal values for the Company as of December 31, 2022, calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% to the estimate of the terminal year
unlevered free cash flow of the Company as reflected in the Company Forecasts (which analysis implied a range of multiples of enterprise value / estimated terminal year
earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, or "EBITDA," of 9.8x to 13.8x). Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of
the capital asset pricing model, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including the company's target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-
tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the U.S. financial
markets generally. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the
Company Forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. For purposes of this analysis, unlevered free cash flow
was defined as Adjusted EBITDA (i) less stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, (ii) less taxes (applying a 22.5% cash tax rate assumption as
provided by the Company to the calculated amount thus far), (iii) plus depreciation and amortization, (iv) less capital expenditures, and (v) adjusted for changes in net working
capital.

Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for the Company by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted
from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for the Company the Company's net debt (defined for this purpose as the Company's debt less cash) as of March 31,
2018, as set forth in the Company's public filings, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for the Company. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity
values by the fully diluted shares of Common Stock outstanding on a standalone basis as of June 15, 2018, calculated using information provided by the Company's
management to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Common Stock of $39.85 to $56.55.

Selected Transactions Analysis

Goldman Sachs analyzed certain publicly available information relating to acquisition transactions announced since 2014 involving target companies in the healthcare
technology industry.

While none of the target companies in the selected transactions are directly comparable to the Company and none of the selected transactions are directly comparable to the
proposed transaction, the target companies in the selected transactions are companies with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain
of the Company's results, market size and product profile.

Table of Contents

Using publicly available information, for each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated the implied enterprise value of the applicable target company based on
the consideration paid in the applicable transaction, as a multiple of the target company's EBITDA for the twelve-month period ended prior to announcement of the applicable
transaction, which is referred to as "LTM EBITDA." The results of this analysis are set forth below.

Based on the results of the foregoing calculations and Goldman Sachs' analyses of the various transactions and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs
applied a reference range of LTM EBITDA multiples of 12.0x to 18.0x to the Company's Adjusted LTM EBITDA for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2018, as
provided by the Company's management, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for the Company. Goldman Sachs subtracted from this range of implied enterprise
values the Company's net debt (defined for this purpose as the Company's debt less cash) as of March 31, 2018, as set forth in the Company's public filings, and divided the
result by the total number of fully diluted shares of Common Stock outstanding as of June 15, 2018, calculated using information provided by the Company's management, to
derive a range of implied values per share of Common Stock of $28.05 to $44.75.

biotech transactions, from June 2008 through June 15, 2018, in which the target company had an implied enterprise value of over $1 billion based on the consideration paid
in the applicable transaction. Goldman Sachs also reviewed and analyzed, using Thomson Reuters data, the premia paid in all acquisitions, regardless of the form of
consideration, of publicly traded companies in the United States in the healthcare industry, other than biotech transactions, from June 2008 through June 15, 2018, in which
the target company had an implied enterprise value of over $1 billion based on the consideration paid in the applicable transaction. For the entire period, Goldman Sachs
calculated the median and mean premia reflected by the respective prices paid in the transactions as compared to the last closing prices of the target companies' shares prior
to the announcement of the transaction. The following shows a summary of the results of the review:

Based on its review of the foregoing data and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 20% to 40% to the
closing price per share of Common Stock as of June 4, 2018, the last completed trading day before the first reported rumor of a potential acquisition of the Company. This
analysis resulted in a range of implied values from $40.75 to $47.55 per share of Common Stock.

General

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or
of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In
arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis
considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of
its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the Company or the proposed transaction.

Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Board as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Verscend
and its affiliates) of shares of Common Stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the $44.75 in cash per share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon
projections of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.
Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors,
none of the Company, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.

The $44.75 in cash per share to be paid to the holders of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was determined through arm's-length negotiations between the
Company and Verscend and was approved by the Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however,
recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Company or

Blair was advised by the senior management of the Company that the Company Forecasts examined by William Blair were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best

William Blair's investment banking services and its opinion were provided for the use and benefit of the Strategy Committee and, at its direction, the Board in connection with
its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger. William Blair's opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of

Blair did not address the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger and William Blair's fairness opinion does not constitute a recommendation
to any holder of Common Stock as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger.

performed certain procedures, including each of the financial analyses described below, and reviewed with the Board the assumptions upon which such
analyses were based, as well as other factors. Although the summary does not purport to describe all of the analyses performed or factors considered by William

Selected Public Company Analysis

William Blair reviewed and compared certain financial information relating to the Company to corresponding financial information, ratios and public market multiples for 14
publicly traded companies within the healthcare technology and data driven technology and services sectors with similar business models and end markets that William Blair
deemed relevant. The companies selected by William Blair in the healthcare technology sector were: (i) Allscripts, (ii) athenahealth, (iii) Cerner, (iv) HMS Holdings,
(v) Inovalon and (vi) IQVIA. The companies selected by William Blair in the data driven technology and services sector were (i) Equifax, (ii) Experian, (iii) Gartner, (iv) IHS
Markit, (v) Nielsen, (vi) Thomson Reuters, (vii) TransUnion and (viii) Verisk Analytics.

Among the information William Blair considered were revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), and net income. In
calculating adjusted EBITDA, William Blair adjusted for certain non-recurring, non-operating and non-cash items, as applicable. William Blair considered the enterprise value
as a multiple of revenue and adjusted EBITDA for each company for the last 12-month period ended March 31, 2018 ("LTM") for which results were publicly available. William
Blair also considered the enterprise value as a multiple of CY 2018E and CY 2019E revenue and adjusted EBITDA for each company for which estimates were publicly
available. William Blair also considered the market capitalization ("price") as a multiple of calendar year 2018 ("CY 2018E") and 2019 ("CY 2019E") estimated adjusted net
income ("earnings") for each company. The operating results and the corresponding derived multiples for the selected public companies were based on each company's most
recent publicly available financial information and closing share prices as of June 15, 2018. William Blair then used the implied enterprise value based on the terms of the
proposed transaction to derive implied valuation multiples for the Company based on revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the LTM period, CY 2018E and CY 2019E. William
Blair also used the implied equity value based on the terms of the proposed transaction to derive implied valuation multiples for the Company based on adjusted net income
for CY 2018E and CY 2019E. William Blair then compared the multiples implied for the Company based on the terms of the proposed transaction to the range of trading
multiples for the selected public companies. Although William Blair compared the trading multiples of the selected public companies to those implied for the Company, none of
the selected public companies is directly comparable to the Company. Accordingly, any analysis of the selected public companies involves considerations and judgments
concerning the differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that

analysis is set forth in the following table:

William Blair noted for the Board that, as shown in the above chart, the implied multiple for the proposed transaction was within the ranges of revenue, adjusted EBITDA and
P/E multiples for the selected public companies.

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis

William Blair performed an analysis of selected precedent transactions consisting of 12 transactions closed since 2015 within the healthcare technology and data driven
technology sectors with enterprise values in excess of $400 million that involved the acquisition of companies with similar business models and end markets that William Blair
deemed relevant. William Blair's analysis was based on publicly available information regarding such transactions. William Blair did not take into account any announced or
consummated transaction whereby relevant financial information was not publicly disclosed and available. The selected transactions were not intended to be representative of
the entire range of possible transactions in the respective industries.

William Blair reviewed the consideration paid in the selected transactions in terms of the enterprise value of the target as a multiple of its revenue and adjusted EBITDA for
the LTM period prior to the announcement of the respective transaction. William Blair compared the resulting range of transaction multiples of revenue and adjusted EBITDA
for the selected transactions to the implied transaction multiples of LTM revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the Company based on the terms of the proposed transaction.

William Blair noted for the Board that, as shown in the above chart, the implied revenue and adjusted EBITDA multiples for the proposed transaction were within the range of

Although William Blair analyzed the multiples implied by the selected transactions and compared them to the implied transaction multiples of the Company, none of these
transactions or associated companies is identical to the Company or the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, any analysis of the selected
transactions necessarily involved complex considerations and judgments concerning the differences in financial and operating characteristics, parties involved and terms of

flows for CY 2018E through CY 2022E. Using discounted cash flow methodology, William Blair calculated the present values of the projected free cash flows for the
Company. In this analysis, William Blair calculated the assumed terminal value of the Company by (i) multiplying projected adjusted EBITDA in CY 2022E by exit multiples
ranging from 12.0x to 15.0x and (ii) utilizing perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.5% of free cash flow for future periods after CY 2022E. To discount the projected
free cash flows and assumed terminal value to present value, William Blair used discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 11.0%. The terminal value exit multiple range was
derived from long-term ranges of relevant precedent transactions and public company trading multiples, and the range of perpetuity growth rates was selected based on long
term industry growth rates. The discount rate range was derived based upon a weighted average cost of capital of the Company and selected public companies using the
capital asset pricing model.

William Blair aggregated the present value of the free cash flows over the applicable forecast period with the present value of the range of terminal values to arrive at an
implied enterprise value range. William Blair then derived a range of implied equity values per share by deducting the Company's net debt as of March 31, 2018 and dividing
such amount by the Company's total diluted outstanding shares as of May 31, 2018. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity values of $35.02 to $57.46 per share,
as compared to the Merger Consideration of $44.75 per share of the Company's Common Stock.

Leveraged Buyout Analysis

Based solely on the Company Forecasts, William Blair performed a leveraged buyout analysis and projected illustrative implied purchase prices as which a leveraged buyout
of the Company could occur and yield for a potential investor. In this analysis, William Blair estimated a terminal value by utilizing a range of CY 2022E EBITDA multiples of
12.0x to 15.0x and assumed internal rate of returns ranging from 16.0% to 20.0%. The terminal value exit multiple range was derived from long-term ranges of relevant
precedent transactions and public company trading multiples. The internal rate of return was derived by William Blair utilizing its professional judgment and experience. This
analysis resulted in a range of implied purchase prices of $34.56 to $45.41 per share of Common Stock, as compared to the Merger Consideration of $44.75 per share of
Common Stock.

M&A Premia Paid Analysis

William Blair reviewed data from 592 public U.S. target transactions occurring after January 1, 2014 in which 100% of the target's equity was acquired at an equity value
greater than $250 million. Specifically, William Blair analyzed the acquisition price per share as a premium to the closing share price each of one day, one week, one month,
60 days, 90 days and 180 days prior to the announcement of each transaction. William Blair compared the range of resulting per share stock price premia for the reviewed
transactions to the premia implied by the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement based on the share price of the Common Stock one day, one week, one
month, 60 days, 90 days and 180 days prior to June 4, 2018 (the last full trading day prior to public news reports that Company was in advanced

regarding fairness is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances, and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. The preparation of an opinion
regarding fairness does not involve a mathematical evaluation or weighing of the results of the individual analyses performed, but requires William Blair to exercise its
professional judgment, based on its experience and expertise, in considering a wide variety of analyses taken as a whole. Each of the analyses conducted by William Blair
was carried out in order to provide a different perspective on the financial terms of the proposed acquisition and add to the total mix of information available. The analyses
were prepared solely for the purpose of William Blair providing its opinion and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which securities actually may
be sold. William Blair did not form a conclusion as to whether any individual analysis, considered in isolation, supported or failed to support an opinion about the fairness of
the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock. Rather, in rendering its oral opinion on June 19, 2018 (subsequently confirmed in writing) to the
Board, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations stated in its written opinion, as to whether the Merger Consideration to be
received by the holders of Common Stock (other

than holders of Dissenting Shares or Cancelled Shares) was fair to such stockholders, from a financial point of view, William Blair considered the results of the analyses in
light of each other and ultimately reached its opinion based on the results of all analyses taken as a whole. William Blair's fairness opinion considered each valuation method
equally and did not place any particular reliance on a specific analysis. Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate factors summarized above, William Blair believes that its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and factors, may create
an incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to the
Company or the proposed transaction. In performing its analyses, William Blair made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, business and economic
conditions and other matters. The analyses performed by William Blair are not necessarily indicative of future actual values and future results, which may be significantly more
or less favorable than suggested by such analyses.

William Blair has been engaged in the investment banking business since 1935. William Blair continually undertakes the valuation of investment securities in connection with
public offerings, private placements, business combinations, estate and gift tax valuations and similar transactions. In the ordinary course of its business, William Blair may
from time to time trade the securities of the Company for its own account and for the accounts of its customers, and accordingly may at any time hold a long or short position
in such securities.

Fees

The Board selected William Blair as its financial advisor given, among other things, William Blair's reputation, knowledge of the Company and the industry, public company
experience and experience with transactions similar to those contemplated by the Board. Pursuant to an engagement letter dated June 17, 2018, the Company has agreed to
pay William Blair an aggregate fee estimated, based on information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $3.6 million, of which (i) $2.1 million is
contingent upon consummation of the proposed transaction and (ii) $1.5 million is an opinion fee previously paid upon delivery of the fairness opinion. No portion of the fees
payable to William Blair was contingent on the conclusions reached by William Blair in William Blair's fairness opinion. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse William
Blair for certain of its out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and expenses of its counsel and any other independent experts retained by William Blair) reasonably incurred by
it in connection with its services and to indemnify William Blair against potential liabilities arising out of its engagement, including certain liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws.

William Blair served as a co-manager for a public offering of 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock in August 2017 and a book-running manager for a public offering of
9,683,000 shares of Common Stock in March 2017, for which it received aggregate underwriting fees of approximately $1.3 million from the Company. In addition, William
Blair has provided certain financial advisory services to Veritas Capital and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time for which William Blair may receive
compensation, including having acted as financial advisor to Veritas Capital in connection with its acquisition of GE Healthcare's Value-Based Care Division announced in
April 2018. William Blair expects to receive compensation for such services of approximately $2.0 million. William Blair has also provided certain financial advisory and/or
underwriting services to Advent and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time for which William Blair may receive compensation, including having acted as a
book-running manager for a public offering of 6,000,000 shares of common stock of Bojangles Inc., a portfolio company of Advent, in November 2016. William Blair has
received compensation for such services of approximately of approximately $300,000. Other than as set forth above, during the prior two year period ended June 19, 2018,
William Blair has not been engaged by, or received fees from, the

other services to or with respect to the Company or Verscend or their respective affiliates in the future, for which it may receive compensation. William Blair and its affiliates
and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell,
hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the
Company, any of their respective affiliates and third parties or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including the Merger.

CERTAIN FINANCIAL FORECASTS 

The Company's senior management prepares projections of the Company's expected financial performance as part of its ongoing management of the business. Other than
guidance in connection with its regularly-scheduled earnings releases, as a matter of course, these projections are not publicly disclosed due to the inherent unpredictability
of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the Company is including certain unaudited prospective financial information, which we refer to as the "Company
Forecasts," in this proxy statement in order to provide stockholders access to a summary of certain nonpublic unaudited prospective financial information that was made
available to the Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger, and was also provided by the Company's senior management to Goldman Sachs and William Blair in
connection with the rendering of their respective opinions to the Board and performing their related financial analyses.

In connection with the Board's review of Cotiviti's strategic alternatives, including the consideration and evaluation of a potential transaction with Verscend, the Company's
senior management prepared and provided to the Board, Goldman Sachs and William Blair the Company Forecasts. The Company Forecasts were reviewed by the Board
and shared with Goldman Sachs and William Blair. At the direction of the Board, Goldman Sachs and William Blair used and relied upon the Company Forecasts in
connection with their financial analyses for purposes of their respective opinions, as summarized in the sections entitled "The Merger—Fairness Opinion of Cotiviti's Financial
Advisor: Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC" and "The Merger—Fairness Opinion of Cotiviti's Financial Advisor: William Blair & Company, L.L.C." of this proxy statement. The
Company Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and reflect subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple
interpretations and frequent revisions based on actual results and business developments.

The Company Forecasts were made available to the Board, Goldman Sachs and William Blair, and the Company Forecasts were used and relied upon by Goldman Sachs
and William Blair in connection with their financial analyses for their respective opinions. The Company Forecasts were also provided to Verscend in connection with its
consideration of the potential transaction. For these reasons, the Company has elected to summarize the Company Forecasts in this proxy statement.

The Company's internal financial forecasts, like the Company Forecasts, and the assumptions upon which the Company Forecasts were based, are subjective in many
respects and thus subject to interpretation. Although presented with numerical specificity, the Company Forecasts are forward-looking statements and are based upon a
variety of estimates and numerous assumptions made by the Company's senior management with respect to, among other matters, industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, including the factors described under the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements" of this proxy statement and other risk factors described in the Company's filings with the SEC, many of which are difficult to predict, are inherently uncertain, are
beyond the Company's control, are subject to significant

economic and competitive uncertainties and may not reflect current prospects for the Company's business, changes in general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, transactions or events that have occurred or that may occur and that were not anticipated when the Company Forecasts were prepared. In
addition, since the Company Forecasts cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. As a result, there can be no
assurance that the estimates and assumptions made in preparing the Company Forecasts will prove accurate, that the projected results will be realized or that actual results
will not be significantly higher or lower than projected. In addition, the Company Forecasts do not take into account the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger, that might also cause actual results to differ materially. The Company's stockholders are urged to review the Company's filings
with the SEC for a description of the Company's actual reported results of operations and financial condition.

The Company Forecasts are not intended to comply with, and include financial metrics that were not prepared in accordance with, GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC
regarding financial projections and the use of non-GAAP measures or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and
presentation of financial projections and forecasts. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information
presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
companies. Neither KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent registered public accounting firm has examined,
compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the Company Forecasts, and, accordingly, neither KPMG LLP nor any other public accounting firm expresses an
opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the Company Forecasts. Reports by KPMG LLP incorporated by reference into this proxy statement relate solely to the
Company's historical financial information. They do not extend to the prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.

The Company defines "Adjusted EBITDA" as net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other non-operating (income) expense such as foreign
currency translation, income tax expense (benefit), transaction-related expenses and other, stock-based compensation and other one-time expenses. Management believes
Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it provides meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons without
regard to our financing methods, capital structure or other items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.

No one has made or makes any representation regarding the information included in the Company Forecasts. Stockholders and other readers of this proxy statement are
cautioned not to rely unduly, if at all, on the Company Forecasts. Some or all of the assumptions that have been made regarding, among other things, the timing of certain
occurrences or effects, may have changed since the date the Company Forecasts were prepared. The Company has not updated or otherwise revised, and does not intend to
update or otherwise revise, the Company Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date when prepared or to reflect the occurrence or non-occurrence of events
after the date when prepared, even if any or all of the assumptions on which the Company Forecasts were based are shown to be inaccurate. Subject to the foregoing
qualifications, set forth below is a summary of the Company Forecasts.

INTERESTS OF THE DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF COTIVITI IN THE MERGER 

In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the
Merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
evaluating and approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger Proposal be approved by our stockholders. See the sections entitled
"The Merger—Background of the Merger" and "The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger" of this proxy statement. You should take these
interests into account in deciding whether to vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal.

These interests are described in more detail below and are also quantified under the section entitled "Executive Compensation Proposal" of this proxy statement. The dates
used below to quantify these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the dates on which certain events will occur. Note that,
in accordance with SEC rules we are required to include this information on behalf of any individual who was an executive officer of Cotiviti at any time since January 1, 2017,

 Although the Board considered this upside case in the context of the transaction, it ultimately determined that the Company Forecasts reflected the best currently available estimates
and judgments of the management of the Company and, as a result, determined that the Company Forecasts should be relied upon by Goldman Sachs and William Blair in preparing
their respective fairness opinions.

Treatment of Cotiviti Equity Awards in the Merger 

Certain of our directors and executive officers hold outstanding Cotiviti stock options and Cotiviti restricted stock unit awards. Under the Merger Agreement, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of our Common Stock that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, will vest in full (to the extent unvested) and will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the Merger
Consideration, net of the applicable per share exercise price, and the aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock subject to the option, subject to applicable
withholding taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld. Options with a per share exercise price equal to or exceeding the Merger Consideration (if any)
will be cancelled without payment.

The Merger Agreement also provides that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock and restricted stock units covering shares of our Common
Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will vest in full (to the extent unvested) and will be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock subject to the award (and
subject to applicable withholding taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld).

The following table sets forth for each required individual the aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock owned or subject to vested and unvested Cotiviti stock
options with an exercise price that does not exceed the Merger Consideration and unvested Cotiviti restricted stock unit awards, in each case as of July 6, 2018. None of our
current or former directors or executive officers hold outstanding restricted stock awards.

Director and Executive Officer Compensation Arrangements 

Employment Agreements

Each of Messrs. Williams, Ferguson, Beaulieu, Samuelson, and Olefson has entered into an employment agreement with Cotiviti (the "Employment Agreement") that provides
the executive with the following payments and benefits if the executive's employment is terminated by Cotiviti without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason" (as such
terms are defined in the applicable agreement, subject to the timely execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims) and continued compliance with certain
restrictive covenants:

• a lump-sum payment in an amount equal to 12 months' (24 months' for Mr. Williams) of the executive's annual base salary then in effect; 

• a pro rata bonus payable in a lump sum for the year in which the termination occurs, determined by multiplying the amount of such bonus that would have been
payable for the year of termination by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full weeks that elapsed during the year through the date of termination
and the denominator of which is 52; and 

• a cash payment equal to the value of continued subsidized coverage under Cotiviti's group medical and dental plans for 12 months, payable in a lump sum.

The Employment Agreements also provide for full accelerated vesting of all unvested equity awards held by the applicable executive upon a qualifying termination within one
year following a change of control.

Transaction Bonuses

On June 19, 2018, in connection with the Merger, the Cotiviti Board approved transaction bonus awards for Messrs. Beaulieu, Ferguson, Olefson, and Samuelson. These
bonuses were granted to Beaulieu, Ferguson, Olefson, and Samuelson pursuant to a transaction bonus agreement, and will be paid to each

within 30 days following the Effective Time, subject to his (i) continued employment through the Effective Time, and (ii) execution and non-revocation of a release of claims
against Cotiviti.

Calderone Retention Agreement and Severance Play Plan

Ms. Calderone is not a party to an employment agreement, however she is eligible to participate in Cotiviti's Severance Pay Plan (the "Severance Plan").

Under the Severance Plan, if Ms. Calderone experiences an "involuntary termination" (as defined in the Severance Plan), then she will receive 10 weeks of base salary,
subject to her timely execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims.

In addition, under a retention bonus agreement entered into in connection with the Merger (the "Retention Agreement"), if Ms. Calderone becomes entitled to receive
severance under the Severance Plan prior to the first anniversary of the Merger, she will receive an additional 16 weeks of base salary (for a total of 26 weeks of base salary)
and she will be eligible to receive outplacement services on terms determined by Cotiviti.

The Retention Agreement also provides that Ms. Calderone will be eligible to receive a cash bonus equal to $85,000, payable in a lump sum within 15 days after the earlier to
occur of (i) her continued employment through the nine-month anniversary of the closing of the Merger and (ii) subject to her timely execution and non-revocation of a general
release of claims, a termination of Ms. Calderone's employment by Cotiviti without "cause" (as determined by Cotiviti).

The Retention Agreement also provides for accelerated vesting of Ms. Calderone's unvested Cotiviti equity awards held by her upon a change in control.

Treatment of Equity Awards in the Event of Change of Control

The grant agreements between Cotiviti and each of Messrs. Williams, Beaulieu, Ferguson, Olefson, and Samuelson and Ms. Calderone governing the treatment of equity
awards provide for immediate vesting of any unvested portion of equity grants upon a change of control, whether a termination event has occurred or not.

Employee Benefits

The Merger Agreement requires Verscend (or the surviving corporation) to continue to provide certain compensation and benefits for a period of one year following the
Effective Time for certain continuing Cotiviti employees, and to take certain actions in respect of employee benefits provided to Cotiviti' employees, including its executive
officers. For a detailed description of these requirements, please see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—Employee Matters" of

Transaction Committee Retainer

In connection with the Merger, the board of directors approved a cash retainer of $22,500 to be paid in a lump sum to the Chairman of the Transaction Committee.

Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers

Verscend has agreed that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of Cotiviti and its subsidiaries against any costs or
expenses incurred in connection with any claim or proceeding occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent that Cotiviti and its subsidiaries would have been
required by applicable law and their respective organizational documents or indemnification agreements, in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement, to indemnify such
persons.

Prior to the Effective Time, Cotiviti will purchase a pre-paid, non-cancelable 6-year "tail" policy, of directors' and officers' liability insurance with respect to matters arising on or
before the Effective Time.

VOTING AGREEMENT 

On June 19, 2018, certain direct and indirect stockholders of Cotiviti representing ownership of approximately 44% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock as of the
date of the Merger Agreement, entered into the Voting Agreement with Verscend, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions therein, such
stockholders agreed to vote their shares of Common Stock in favor of the Merger Proposal and Adjournment Proposal and against any alternative proposal (including an
Acquisition Proposal) or any other action, agreement or transaction intended to impede or interfere with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or the performance of the stockholders under the Voting Agreement. In addition, each stockholder party to the Voting Agreement waived its appraisal rights under
the DGCL. The Voting Agreement terminates upon the earliest to occur of (i) mutual consent by the stockholders party to the Voting Agreement and Verscend; (ii) the
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms prior to the Effective Time; (iii) the Cotiviti Board changing its recommendation that Cotiviti's stockholders
adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms of and to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement; (iv) the Effective Time; and (v) in the event the Merger
Agreement is amended without the prior written consent of the stockholders party to the Voting Agreement and such amendment, among other things, decreases the amount
or changes the form of Merger Consideration or otherwise is materially adverse to the stockholders party to the Voting Agreement relative to the other stockholders of Cotiviti.

FINANCING OF THE MERGER 

The Merger Agreement is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Verscend. We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to consummate the Merger and the
related transactions, not including fees and expenses, will be approximately $4.9 billion, including the estimated funds needed to (i) pay our stockholders the Merger
Consideration due to them under the Merger Agreement; (ii) make payments in respect of outstanding Cotiviti stock options, restricted stock unit awards and restricted stock
awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement; and (iii) pay the outstanding net indebtedness of Cotiviti.

Verscend has obtained financing commitments for the purpose of financing the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and paying related
fees and expenses. The Veritas Capital Fund VI, L.P. has committed to capitalize Verscend, immediately prior to the Effective Time, with an aggregate equity contribution of
up to $790 million, subject to the terms and conditions set

financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to $4,615 million on the terms set forth in a debt commitment letter. Additionally, Verscend and Verscend Holding Corp. have
received a preferred equity commitment in an amount of up to $575 million on the terms set forth in a preferred equity commitment letter. The obligations of the Lenders to
provide debt financing under the debt commitment letter, and the obligations of the preferred investors to provide preferred equity financing under the preferred equity
commitment letter, in each case, are subject to customary terms and conditions. The Merger Agreement provides that Verscend and Verscend Holding Corp. will use
reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary or advisable to arrange and obtain and consummate the Financing on or prior to the Effective Time.

CLOSING AND EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER 

The closing of the Merger will take place at the offices of Latham & Watkins LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10022, at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on the date which is
three business days after the date on which all of the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (described under the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—
Conditions to the Merger" of this proxy statement) have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied immediately prior to or at
the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Cotiviti and Verscend. However, if the
marketing period has not begun or ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that are to
be satisfied at the closing) the closing will occur on the earlier of (i) a date during the marketing period specified by Verscend on no less than three business days' notice to
Cotiviti and (ii) the third business day after the end of the marketing period (subject in each case to the satisfaction or waiver (by the party entitled to grant such waiver) of all
the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement described under the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger" of this proxy statement as of
the date determined pursuant to this sentence).

Concurrently with, or as promptly as practicable after, the closing, Cotiviti will cause to be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State an appropriate, executed certificate of
merger with respect to the Merger in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger will become effective upon the filing of such certificate of merger, or at such later date and time
as is agreed by Verscend and Cotiviti and specified in such certificate of merger.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS 

If the Merger is consummated, Cotiviti's stockholders will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262, provided they comply with the
conditions established by Section 262.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262,
which is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix D. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation that
stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.

Under Section 262, record holders of Common Stock who make the demand described below with respect to such shares, do not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal,
continuously hold such shares through the Effective Time, and otherwise comply with the statutory requirements of Section 262 will be entitled to an appraisal of their shares
of our Common Stock and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of their shares as of the Effective Time, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be
fair value. The "fair value" of

the shares of our Common Stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be more than, less than, or equal to the Merger Consideration per share
that holders thereof are otherwise entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. Stockholders should be aware that an investment banking opinion as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address
"fair value" under Section 262 of the DGCL. All references in this summary of appraisal rights to a "stockholder" or "holders of shares" are to the record holder or holders of
such shares of our Common Stock.

Under Section 262, when a merger agreement is to be submitted by a corporation's board of directors for adoption at a meeting of such corporation's stockholders, not less
than 20 days before such meeting, the corporation submitting the matter to a vote of stockholders must notify the stockholders who were stockholders on the record date for
notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights will be available pursuant to Section 262 that such appraisal rights will be available. A copy of
Section 262 must be included with such notice. This proxy statement constitutes Cotiviti's notice to its stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the
Merger and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix D, in compliance with the requirements of Section 262. Stockholders who wish to
exercise such appraisal rights should carefully review the text of Section 262 contained in Appendix D. Failure to comply timely and properly with the requirements of
Section 262 may result in the loss of such stockholder's appraisal rights under the DGCL. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising appraisal
rights, Cotiviti believes that a stockholder considering the exercise of such rights should seek the advice of legal counsel.

Stockholders who wish to exercise their appraisal rights of their shares of our Common Stock must deliver to Cotiviti a written demand for appraisal of the holder's shares
before the vote is taken to approve the Merger Proposal. The demand must reasonably inform Cotiviti of the identity of the holder of record of shares who intends to demand
appraisal of his, her or its shares. A stockholder seeking appraisal of his or her shares may not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal. If a stockholder fails to
deliver such written demand or votes or submits a proxy in favor of the Merger Proposal, such stockholder may remain entitled to receive the per share Merger Consideration,
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for his, her or its shares of our Common Stock but will not have appraisal rights with respect to such shares. In
addition, a holder of shares wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to
hold such shares of record through the Effective Time.

A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless properly revoked, be voted "FOR" the Merger Proposal, and it may result in the loss of the
stockholder's right of appraisal and nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights must either submit a proxy containing instructions to vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal or "ABSTAIN" from voting on the Merger Proposal. Voting against
or failing to vote on the Merger Proposal by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in
addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal.

All demands for appraisal should be addressed to:

and must be delivered to Cotiviti before the vote is taken to approve the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting, and must be executed by, or on behalf of, the stockholder.
The demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs Cotiviti of the identity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to demand appraisal of the "fair value" of his,
her or its shares of our Common Stock. A stockholder's failure to deliver to Cotiviti the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the Special
Meeting may result in the loss of appraisal rights.

Only a holder of record is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that holder's name. Accordingly, to be effective, a demand for appraisal by a stockholder
must be made by, or on behalf of, the record stockholder. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the record stockholder's name as it appears in the transfer agent's
records and should specify the stockholder's mailing address and the number of shares registered in the stockholder's name. The demand must state that the person intends
thereby to demand appraisal of the stockholder's shares in connection with the Merger. The demand cannot be made by the person having a beneficial interest in such shares
if he or she does not also hold such shares of record. A person having a beneficial interest in shares that are held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker,
fiduciary, bank or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized herein properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal
rights. If shares are owned of record by a person other than the beneficial owner, including a broker, fiduciary (such as a trustee, guardian or custodian), bank or other
nominee, such demand must be executed by or for the record owner. If a stockholder holds shares through a broker or bank who in turn holds the shares through a central
securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the
depository nominee as record holder. If a stockholder holds through a broker, bank or other nominee and wishes to exercise appraisal rights, such stockholder should consult
with his, her or its broker, bank or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by the nominee.

If shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal must be made in that capacity. If the
shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized
agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the
record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the record owner. A record owner, such as a broker,
bank or other nominee, who holds shares as a nominee for others, may exercise his or her right of appraisal with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial
owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares as to which appraisal is sought. Where
no number of shares is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of the record owner.

Within 10 days after the Effective Time, the surviving corporation in the Merger must give written notice of the Effective Time to each stockholder who has demanded
appraisal in accordance with Section 262 and who did not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder who has
not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the stockholder's demand and accept the Merger Consideration, without
interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for that holder's shares of our Common Stock by delivering to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand
for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the surviving corporation.
No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, with such
approval conditioned

upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. If the surviving corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that
approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such stockholder's right to appraisal in accordance with the proviso in the immediately
preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the
appraised value of his, her or its shares of our Common Stock determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value may be more than, less than, or equal to the Merger
Consideration per share, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, either the surviving corporation or any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 and is
entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the
fair value of the shares held by all such stockholders. Upon the filing of the petition by a stockholder, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the surviving
corporation. The surviving corporation has no obligation to file such petition and has no present intention to file a petition and holders should not assume that the surviving
corporation will file a petition. In the event that the surviving corporation does not file such petition, it is the obligation of the holders of our Common Stock to initiate all
necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights with respect to shares within the time prescribed in Section 262. In addition, within 120 days after the Effective Time, any
stockholder who has theretofore complied with the applicable provisions of Section 262 will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written request, a
statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and
the aggregate number of holders of such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person and for
which appraisal has been properly demanded may, in such person's own name, file a petition for appraisal or request from the surviving corporation such statement. The
statement must be mailed within 10 days after such written request has been received by the surviving corporation or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for
delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.

If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, then the surviving corporation will be obligated, within
20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names
and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After
notice to stockholders who have demanded appraisal from the Delaware Register in Chancery, if such notice is ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware
Court of Chancery will conduct a hearing upon the petition and determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to the
appraisal rights provided by Section 262. Additionally, because our Common Stock will have been publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Delaware Court of
Chancery is required under Section 262 to dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of
shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock or (ii) the value of the Merger Consideration for such total number of shares of our
Common Stock exceeds $1 million.

After determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the shares, determining their fair value as of the
Effective Time after taking into account all relevant factors exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. When the fair value has been determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment
of such value by the surviving corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Unless the

Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in the following sentence, interest from the Effective Time
through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the appraisal
proceeding, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided in the
preceding sentence only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.

Neither Cotiviti nor Verscend anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration provided for in the Merger Agreement to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights and
they reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the "fair value" of a share of our Common Stock is less than the per share
Merger Consideration. In determining "fair value," the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., 457 A.2d
701 (Del. 1983), the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value
by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered and that "[f]air
price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company." The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of
fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of
the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., 634 A.2d 345 (Del. 1993), the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such
exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court also stated that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are
known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered."

Costs of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include attorneys' fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and
imposed upon the surviving corporation and the stockholders participating in the appraisal proceeding by the Delaware Court of Chancery, as it deems equitable in the
circumstances. Each dissenting stockholder is responsible for his, her or its attorneys and expert witness expenses, although upon the application of a dissenting stockholder,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts used in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to
appraisal. Any stockholder who demanded appraisal rights will not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote shares subject to that demand for any purpose or to receive
payments of dividends or any other distribution with respect to those shares other than with respect to payment as of the Record Date prior to the Effective Time.

At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party will have
the right to withdraw such demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the Merger; after this period, the stockholder may withdraw such demand for appraisal only
with the consent of the surviving corporation. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery within 120 days after the Effective Time, or if the
stockholder otherwise fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal, then the

stockholder's right to appraisal shall cease, and such stockholder will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding
taxes. Inasmuch as the surviving corporation has no obligation to file such a petition, and has no present intention to do so, any holder of shares who desires such a petition
to be filed is advised to file it on a timely basis. As indicated above, any stockholder may withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal by delivering to the surviving
corporation a written withdrawal of his, her or its demand for appraisal and acceptance of the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding
taxes, except (i) that any such attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the surviving corporation and (ii) that no
appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval
may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, provided, however, that the preceding clause (ii) shall not affect the right of any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept
the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, on terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time.

Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder's statutory appraisal rights.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER 

The following discussion is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that generally are relevant to holders of shares of Common Stock whose
shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), and other applicable authorities, all as in
effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing
interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of Common
Stock as "capital assets" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes). This summary does not describe any of the tax
consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign tax jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation
(e.g., estate, gift or alternative minimum tax or the Medicare net investment income surtax). In addition, this summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax
consequences to holders of shares who exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL. For purposes of this discussion, a "holder" means either a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S.
Holder or both, as the context may require.

This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances,
including:

• holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as: financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, S corporations or
any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any investors in or owners of any
such S corporation, entity or arrangement, insurance companies, mutual funds, dealers in stocks and securities, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-
to-market method of accounting for their securities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, or certain expatriates or former long-term
residents of the United States;

• holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reducing transaction; 

• holders that received their shares of Common Stock in a compensatory transaction; 

• holders that are "controlled foreign corporations" or "passive foreign investment companies", as those terms are used in the Code; 

• holders that have held at any time, directly, indirectly or constructively, more than 5% of our Common Stock; 

• holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Verscend or the surviving corporation; or 

• U.S. Holders whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar.

If an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is an owner of shares of Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such
partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding the shares of Common Stock and partners therein
should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the Merger.

We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary. No
assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this summary, or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD
CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION OR
OTHER TAX LAWS.

U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock who or that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

• A corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of
Columbia; 

• An estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

• A trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons as defined in
section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

Table of Contents

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
general, such U.S. Holder's gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the Merger (determined before deduction for
any applicable withholding taxes) and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis generally will
equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S.
Holder's holding period in such shares is more than 1 year at the time of the consummation of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term
capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of Common Stock at different
times and different prices, that U.S. Holder must determine its, his or her gain or loss, adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Common
Stock.

Non-U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, the term "Non-U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock who or that is not a U.S. Holder or partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

• the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch
profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty); or 

• such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition, and certain other specified
conditions are met, in which case such gain (net of certain losses) will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable
tax treaty).

REGULATORY APPROVALS REQUIRED FOR THE MERGER 

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters

Under the HSR Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Merger cannot be consummated until Cotiviti and Verscend
each file a notification and report form with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period thereunder
has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties'
filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. Cotiviti and Verscend and its affiliates filed their respective HSR Act
notifications on July 2, 2018. On July 13, 2018, the FTC notified Cotiviti and Verscend that the request for early termination of the applicable waiting period was granted.

At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest,

including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets
or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the consummation of the Merger, and notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could
include seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under
the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

In connection with obtaining any approval or consent related to any applicable law, Verscend has agreed to take, or cause to be taken (including by its subsidiaries and
affiliates), any and all actions necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened commencement of any proceeding in any forum or the
issuance of any governmental order that would delay, enjoin, prevent, restrain or prohibit the Merger.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF COMMON STOCK 

Our Common Stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "COTV." If the Merger is consummated,
Cotiviti will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend and our Common Stock will be delisted from the New York Stock
Exchange and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following summary describes certain material provisions of the Merger Agreement. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger
Agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the Merger
Agreement carefully in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations
of the parties are governed by the express terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement 

The Merger Agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement. Factual disclosures
about Cotiviti contained in this proxy statement or in Cotiviti's public reports previously filed with the SEC that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement may
supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures about Cotiviti contained in the Merger Agreement and described in this summary. The representations, warranties and
covenants made in the Merger Agreement by Cotiviti, Verscend and Merger Sub were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specified dates and were
qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by Cotiviti, Verscend and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In particular,
in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations
and warranties were negotiated solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement with the principal purpose of contractually allocating risk between the parties to
the Merger Agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different
from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC, and in some cases were qualified by confidential disclosures that were made
by each party to the other, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and
warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement and subsequent
developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been included in this proxy statement or in the respective public filings made by each of
Cotiviti or Verscend with the SEC. Accordingly, the representations and warranties and provisions of the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but instead should be
read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. You should not rely on
the representations, warranties, and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual statement of facts or conditions of the parties thereto or any of
their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.

Additional information about Cotiviti may be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and Cotiviti's other public filings. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find More
Information" of this proxy statement.

agreed to in writing by Cotiviti and Verscend. However, if the marketing period has not begun or ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement (other than those conditions that are to be satisfied at the closing) the closing will occur on the earlier of (i) a date during the marketing period specified by
Verscend on no less than three business days' notice to Cotiviti and (ii) the third business day after the end of the marketing period (subject in each case to the satisfaction or
waiver (by the party entitled to grant such waiver) of all the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (described under the section entitled "The Merger Agreement

Concurrently with, or as promptly as practicable after the closing, Cotiviti will cause to be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State an appropriate, executed certificate of
merger with respect to the Merger in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger will become effective upon the filing of such certificate of merger, or at such later date and time
as is agreed by Verscend and Cotiviti and specified in such certificate of merger.

Structure of the Merger; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers 

Upon the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into Cotiviti and the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub will cease, with Cotiviti continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Verscend. At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Cotiviti
will, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time except that the name of the corporation therein will be changed to Cotiviti, such amended and restated certificate of incorporation will be the certificate of incorporation
of the surviving corporation until thereafter amended. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Cotiviti will be amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to the bylaws of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time except that the name of the corporation therein will be changed to Cotiviti, until thereafter amended. From and
after the Effective Time, the officers of Cotiviti immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial officers of, and, unless otherwise determined by Verscend prior to the
Effective time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial directors of, the surviving corporation and, in each case, will hold office until
their respective successors are duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal, in accordance with the surviving corporation's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

Effect of the Merger on our Common Stock 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Verscend, Merger Sub or Cotiviti or their respective stockholders, each share of Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including shares of Common Stock that were issued as restricted Common Stock that have vested on
or prior to the date of the consummation of the Merger, but excluding any Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. From and after the Effective Time, such Common Stock will no longer be outstanding, will
automatically be cancelled and retired, and will cease to exist, and each holder of a share of Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive, upon surrender of Book-Entry Shares, the Merger Consideration.

At the Effective Time, any shares of Common Stock that are Cancelled Shares will automatically be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and will cease to
exist, and no consideration or payment will be delivered in exchange for such shares.

The Merger Consideration will be adjusted appropriately to provide the same economic effect as contemplated in the Merger Agreement to reflect the effect of any
reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date occurring on or after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

Treatment of Equity Awards; ESPP 

Options. Under the Merger Agreement, each Cotiviti stock option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will (i) vest in full, and (ii) by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Cotiviti option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Cotiviti option, subject to reduction for
any applicable withholding or other taxes required by applicable law to be withheld. Options with a per share exercise price equal to or exceeding the Merger Consideration
will be cancelled without payment.

Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards. The Merger Agreement also provides that each Cotiviti restricted stock award and Cotiviti restricted stock unit
award that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time will (i) vest in full, and (ii) by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, be cancelled and terminated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to

any applicable withholding or other taxes required by applicable law to be withheld.

ESPP. Cotiviti has agreed to, subject to the consummation of the Merger, terminate its employee stock purchase plan effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Participants who purchased shares of our Common Stock under the ESPP and who continue to hold such shares as of the Effective Time will receive the same Merger
Consideration in the same manner as other stockholders for each such share the participant holds as of the Effective Time. The most recent offering period in effect under the
ESPP ended as scheduled on June 29, 2018 and all outstanding rights to purchase options under the ESPP were exercised on such date. Thereafter, Cotiviti agreed that no
additional offering periods would commence under the employee stock purchase plan.

Cotiviti shall take all actions with respect to the ESPP that are necessary to provide that, subject to the consummation of the Merger, the ESPP shall terminate effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the termination of the ESPP, any funds that remain within the associated accumulated payroll
withholding account for each participant shall be returned to such participant. With respect to any offering period outstanding as of the date of the Merger Agreement under
the ESPP, promptly following the date of the Merger Agreement, each option granted pursuant to the ESPP shall be deemed to have been exercised upon the earlier to occur
of (A) the day that is four business days prior to the Effective Time or (B) the date on which such offering period would otherwise end, and no additional offering period shall
commence under the ESPP after the date of the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Effective Time does not occur prior to the End Date,
Cotiviti and Verscend agree to negotiate in good faith to permit the commencement of new offering periods under the ESPP.

Other Covenants and Agreements 

Access and Information

Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, until the Effective Time, Cotiviti will, and will cause its subsidiaries and their respective representatives to, (upon reasonable
notice) afford Verscend, Merger Sub and their financing sources and their respective affiliates and representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, in such
a manner as to not unreasonably interference with the normal operation of Cotiviti and its subsidiaries, to the properties, books, contracts, commitments, tax returns, records
and appropriate representatives of Cotiviti and its subsidiaries.

No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals

From and after the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which the Merger Agreement is validly terminated by its terms,
except as expressly permitted pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Cotiviti (a) will (and will cause its subsidiaries and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its
representatives to) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions, solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any third party with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal and (b) will not (and will cause its subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives not to): (i) solicit, initiate, seek
or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiry, discussion, offer or request relating to, or that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any non-public information relating to Cotiviti and its subsidiaries
to, or afford access to the properties, books or records or employees of Cotiviti and its subsidiaries to, any third party with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to any Acquisition Proposal (provided Cotiviti may grant a waiver of or terminate any "standstill" or similar agreement or obligation of any third party to allow such third
party to submit an Acquisition Proposal), (iii) other than enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, approve, endorse, recommend or enter into (or publicly propose
to approve, endorse, recommend or enter into) any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other
definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) agree, propose or resolve to take, or take, any of the foregoing actions.

Notwithstanding the limitations in the preceding paragraph, if Cotiviti receives, at any time following the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to obtaining the Required
Company Stockholder Approval, a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation and related
provisions of the Merger Agreement (other than any breach that is both immaterial and unintentional) and the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (i) such proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal, (ii) the failure to
take the action described in the immediately following clause (x) or (y) would be inconsistent with the Board's fiduciary duties to the stockholders under applicable law, then
Cotiviti and its representatives may (x) furnish non-public information and afford access to the books or records or officers of Cotiviti and its subsidiaries to such third party
and its representatives pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to Cotiviti than those contained in the
confidentiality agreement between Cotiviti and Verscend and that does not prohibit Cotiviti from complying with the non-solicitation provisions of the

and (y) engage in discussions and negotiations with such third party and its representatives. Any non-public information provided to any third party making an Acquisition
Proposal must also be provided to Verscend prior to or substantially concurrent with the time such information is made available to such third party. In any event, Cotiviti is
permitted to contact any third party making an Acquisition Proposal to clarify the terms of such proposal and inform any such third party of Cotiviti's non-solicitation obligations
under the Merger Agreement.

Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, neither the Board nor any committee thereof will or will
propose publicly to (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify change, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Verscend, its recommendation in favor of adoption of the Merger
Agreement, (ii) fail to include the Board's recommendation in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement in this Proxy Statement, (iii) fail to reaffirm the Board's
recommendation in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement within four business days of a request by Verscend to do so, (iv) fail to recommend against any other
Acquisition Proposal within four business days of a request by Verscend to do so, (v) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer by
a third party, (vi) approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend any Acquisition Proposal (any
action described in clauses (i) through (vi) of this sentence is referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (vii) adopt or approve, or cause or permit Cotiviti to
enter into or otherwise resolve or agree to any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other
definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

If, at any time prior to receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval and after first complying with the non-solicitation and related provisions of the Merger
Agreement, Cotiviti or the Board receives a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation and related provisions of the Merger Agreement (other
than any breach that is both immaterial and unintentional), the Board may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and validly terminate the Merger Agreement according
to the terms of the Merger Agreement while substantially concurrently entering into a definitive agreement providing for such Superior Proposal (subject to first complying with
Cotiviti's obligations in the non-solicitation and related provisions of the Merger Agreement and satisfaction of Cotiviti's termination fee obligations described below), if (i) the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Cotiviti's financial outside legal advisors, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board's
fiduciary duties to the stockholders under applicable law, (ii) Cotiviti has notified Verscend in writing, at least three business days in advance, that it intends to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change and terminate the Merger Agreement, which such written notice includes written notice of the material terms of the Superior Proposal
which enabled the Board to make a determination that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal (iii) for a period of three business days following the notice delivered
pursuant to clause (ii) of this sentence, Cotiviti and its representatives shall have negotiated with Verscend in good faith (to the extent Verscend desires to negotiate) any
proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and related transaction documents (with any amendment to any material term or condition of
any Superior Proposal requiring a new notice and a new two business-day negotiation period) and (iv) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with Cotiviti's financial and outside legal advisors), after considering in good faith any proposed amendment or modification to the
Merger Agreement and related transaction documents made by Verscend in writing, that (1) the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the notice described in clause (ii) of
this sentence still constitutes a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board's fiduciary duties to the stockholders under
applicable law.

For purposes of the Merger Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means:

• other than the Merger or any other proposal or offer from Verscend or any of its subsidiaries, any proposal or offer from a third party relating to any direct or
indirect (i) acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of (A) twenty percent (20%) or more of the assets of Cotiviti and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) twenty percent (20%) or more of the combined voting power of Cotiviti; (ii) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person or entity or group acquiring beneficial ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the combined voting power
Cotiviti; or (iii) merger, reorganization, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, share exchange or other transaction
involving Cotiviti or any of its subsidiaries in which a third party or its stockholders, if consummated, would acquire twenty percent (20%) or more of the
combined voting power of Cotiviti or the surviving entity or the resulting direct or indirect parent of Cotiviti or such surviving entity.

For purposes of the Merger Agreement, "Required Company Stockholder Approval" means:

• the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL to adopt the
Merger Agreement at the Cotiviti stockholders' meeting.

For purposes of the Merger Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means:

• any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not in breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement (except the references therein to "twenty
percent (20%)" shall be replaced by "fifty percent (50%)") made by a third party which, the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
and outside legal advisors, taking into account such factors as the Board considers to be appropriate, would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is
more favorable from a financial point of view to Cotiviti's stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the Merger, after taking into account any revisions,
amendments or modifications to the terms of the Merger Agreement made or agreed to by Verscend.

Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal, prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Approval, the Board may, in response to an Intervening Event (as
defined below), effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if (i) Cotiviti has notified Verscend in writing, at least three business days in advance, that it intends to effect such
an Adverse Recommendation Change (which includes a reasonably detailed summary of the facts, events and/or circumstances relating to the Intervening Event and the
reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change); (ii) for a period of three business days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence, Cotiviti and
its affiliates and representatives shall have negotiated with Verscend in good faith any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and
related transaction documents (to the extent Verscend desires to negotiate); and (iii) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Board shall have determined in
good faith (after consultation with Cotiviti's financial and outside legal advisors), after considering and taking into account the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to the Merger Agreement and related transaction documents made by Verscend in writing, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Board's fiduciary duties to the stockholder under applicable law.

For purposes of the Merger Agreement, "Intervening Event" means:

• any material event, occurrence or fact with respect to Cotiviti and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, occurring or arising after the date of the Merger Agreement
that was not

from a breach of the Merger Agreement by Cotiviti or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) changes in our Common Stock's price, in and of itself (however, the underlying
reasons for such changes may constitute an Intervening Event unless excluded by any other exclusion in this definition); or (iv) the fact that, in and of itself,
Cotiviti exceeds any internal or published projections, estimates or expectations of Cotiviti's revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of
operations for any period, in and of itself (provided, however, the underlying reasons for such events may constitute an Intervening Event unless excluded by
any other exclusion in this definition).

From the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which the Merger Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms, Cotiviti
will provide Verscend (i) prompt written notice (and in any event within one business day) of the receipt by Cotiviti or any of its representatives of any Acquisition Proposal
from any third party or any request for non-public information or offer or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal from any third party, and
the identity of such third party and the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) promptly provide (and in any event within one business day) copies of
all materials provided by Cotiviti to such third party, and (iii) prompt written notice setting forth any information reasonably necessary to keep Verscend informed of material
oral or written communications regarding, and the status and material details (including material amendments or proposed material amendments) of any such Acquisition
Proposal or other request, offer or inquiry.

The Merger Agreement provides that nothing therein will prohibit Cotiviti or the Board, directly or indirectly through its representatives, from (i) disclosing to Cotiviti
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to its stockholders) (provided that
such disclosure does not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to its stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any other legally required communication to its stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement if the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial outside legal advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Board's
fiduciary duties to the stockholders under applicable law; provided, however, that (1) in no event will the preceding sentence affect the obligations described above in respect
of a Superior Proposal and Intervening Event and (2) any such disclosure (other than making any "stop, look and listen" communication to its stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board with respect to the Merger
Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change, unless the Board in connection with such communication publicly states
that its recommendation in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement has not changed.

Special Meeting and Related Actions 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in accordance with Cotiviti's organizational documents, applicable law and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, Cotiviti is
required to, as soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of the Merger Agreement establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
Special Meeting of the stockholders of Cotiviti for the purpose of seeking the Required Company Stockholder Approval. Unless there has been an Adverse Recommendation
Change in compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, Cotiviti will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement. Unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms, Cotiviti will submit the Merger Agreement to its stockholders for adoption at
such meeting, whether or not the Board at any time after the date of the Merger Agreement has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change.

Employee Matters 

For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Verscend will provide, or will cause the surviving corporation to provide, to each continuing employee:

• an annual base salary, target cash incentive opportunity and severance benefits, in each case, that are not less than those provided to such continuing
employee immediately prior to the Merger; and 

• employee benefits that are substantially comparable (in the aggregate) to the employee benefits (including retirement, health and welfare benefits but excluding
for such purposes defined benefit pension benefits, retiree health and life insurance benefits and equity compensation) provided to the employee immediately
prior to the Merger.

As of the Effective Time and thereafter, Verscend will provide that years of service with Cotiviti will be taken into account for purposes of determining the eligibility for
participation and vesting and benefit accrual of any continuing employee under employee benefit plans, programs and policies maintained by Verscend, the surviving
corporation or their affiliates in which such continuing employees become participants (excluding any defined benefit pension plan or post-retirement health and life
insurance).

With respect to each welfare benefit plan maintained by Verscend, the surviving corporation or any of their respective affiliates for the benefit of continuing employees,
Verscend will (i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan,
and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under plans, to the extent such were waived or satisfied under the comparable health or welfare
benefit plan of Cotiviti or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) cause each continuing employee to be given credit under such plan for
deductibles, co-payments and any lifetime maximums the plan year that includes the Effective Time as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the plans maintained by Verscend, the surviving corporation or any of their respective affiliates, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs.

In addition, if requested by Verscend at least 10 business days prior to the Effective Time, Cotiviti will terminate its 401(k) plan, effective no later than the day immediately
preceding the closing of the Merger. If Cotiviti's 401(k) plan is terminated, Verscend will maintain a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan for the benefit of
continuing employees and will cause such plan to accept direct rollovers of the continuing employees' account balances (including loans).

Efforts to Consummate the Merger 

Cotiviti, Verscend and Merger Sub will each use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) take all appropriate action and do all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
law or otherwise to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii) obtain from any governmental authority any material
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or governmental orders (including all material company licenses and healthcare permits) required to be
obtained by Cotiviti, Verscend or Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or proceeding by any governmental authority, in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Cotiviti, Verscend and Merger Sub will each as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement, upon a date to be mutually agreed upon by them
(and in any event within 10 business days following the date of the Merger Agreement, unless agreed otherwise), make its respective filings under the HSR Act, and
thereafter make any other applications and filings as reasonably determined by Cotiviti and Verscend under other applicable antitrust laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Cotiviti, Verscend and Merger Sub will (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or proceeding by
or before any governmental authority with respect to the Merger; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of the foregoing; (iii) promptly inform the other parties of
any communications to or from a governmental authority regarding approval of the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iv) respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to additional requests for information; and (v) use reasonable best efforts to (1) obtain early termination or expiration of the waiting period
under the HSR Act and such other approvals, consents and clearances as may be necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable law and (2) prevent the entry in any
action or proceeding brought by a governmental authority which would prohibit, make unlawful or delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

In connection with obtaining any approval or consent related to any applicable law, Verscend will take, or cause to be taken (including by its subsidiaries and affiliates), any
and all actions necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened commencement of any proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of any
governmental authority or the issuance of any governmental order that would delay, enjoin, prevent, restrain or prohibit the Merger. These steps may include (i) proffering and
consenting and/or agreeing to a governmental order or other agreement providing for the sale, licensing or other disposition, or the holding separate of, or other limitations or
restrictions on, or limiting any freedom of action with respect to, particular assets, categories of assets or lines of business and (ii) promptly effecting such actions in order to
consummate the Merger on or prior to the End Date.

Conduct of Business Pending the Merger 

The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions in the disclosure schedules delivered by Cotiviti in connection with the Merger Agreement, and except as
may be expressly contemplated by the Merger Agreement, required by law or as consented to by Verscend in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed for certain of the actions described below), during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement to the Effective Time (or the date, if any, on which
the Merger Agreement is terminated by its terms), (i) Cotiviti will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, conduct its operations, in all material respects, in the ordinary
course of business and in a manner consistent with past practice and, use commercially reasonable efforts to keep available the services of

PROPOSAL NO. 1: THE MERGER PROPOSAL

THE MERGER PROPOSAL 

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, which we refer to as the
Merger Proposal. For a detailed discussion of the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement" of this proxy statement. A
copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A. See also the section entitled "The Merger" of this proxy statement.

VOTE REQUIRED 

Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of the close of
business on the Record Date. Failure to vote your shares, an abstention from voting your shares, or a broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
Merger Proposal.

As described under the section entitled "The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger" of this proxy statement, after considering various factors

PROPOSAL NO. 2: THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL

The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about compensation for each of
our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger and assuming the Merger is consummated on the latest practicable date prior to the filing of
this proxy statement, July 18, 2018. The compensation arrangements of our named executive officers that are described in the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of the
Directors and Executive Officers of Cotiviti in the Merger" of this proxy statement are incorporated herein by reference.

Please note that the amounts indicated below are estimates based on the material assumptions described in the notes to the table below, which may or may not actually
occur. Some of these assumptions are based on information currently available and, as a result, the actual amounts, if any, that may become payable to a named executive
officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below. Furthermore, for purposes of calculating such amounts, we have assumed:

• a closing date of the Merger of July 18, 2018 (which is the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this proxy statement); 

• the employment of each named executive officer is terminated by Cotiviti without "cause" or, with respect to Messrs. Williams, Ferguson, Beaulieu, Samuelson
and Olefson, by the named executive officer for "good reason," in either case, immediately following the consummation of the Merger; and 

• the value of the accelerated vesting of any Cotiviti equity award is calculated based on a price per share of Common Stock equal to the Merger Consideration of
$44.75.

execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims and the executive's continued compliance with confidentiality, non-disparagement,
inventions assignment, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants contained in the Employment Agreements. In such an event, these executives
would receive:

(i) the executive's annual base salary for 24 months (Mr. Williams) or 12 months (Messrs. Ferguson, Beaulieu, Samuelson and Olefson), payable
in a lump sum within 60 days following the termination date; and 

(ii) the executive's bonus for the year of termination prorated for the portion of the year worked, payable within 90 days following December 31,
2018. 

Under the Severance Plan, Ms. Calderone would be eligible to receive 10 weeks of base pay upon an "involuntary termination" (within the
meaning of the Severance Plan), subject to her timely execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims. Pursuant to her Retention
Agreement, (i) if Ms. Calderone becomes entitled to receive severance under the Severance Plan prior to the first anniversary of the Merger,
she will receive an additional 16 weeks of base pay (for a total of 26 weeks of base pay) and (ii) Ms. Calderone is eligible to receive a cash

PROPOSAL NO. 2: THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each Cotiviti stock option and restricted stock unit award that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of the Merger, whether vested or unvested, will vest in full (to the extent unvested) and will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash
payment equal to the product of the Merger Consideration, net of any applicable per share exercise price, and the aggregate number of shares of our
Common Stock subject to the award, subject to applicable withholding taxes or other amounts required by applicable law to be withheld. 

In addition, the agreements governing these awards provide for immediate vesting of any unvested portion of the award upon a "change of control",
and the Employment Agreements provide for full accelerated vesting of all unvested equity awards held by the applicable executive upon a qualifying
termination within one year following a change of control. Ms. Calderone's Retention Agreement also provides for accelerated vesting of unvested
Cotiviti equity awards held by her upon a change in control. 

The following table quantifies the number of Cotiviti shares subject to unvested Cotiviti stock options and restricted stock units held by the named
executive officers, and quantifies the value of such awards based on a price per share of Common Stock equal to the Merger Consideration.
Depending on when the closing date of the Merger occurs, certain Cotiviti equity awards shown in the table may vest in accordance with their terms
prior to the closing date. All amounts listed in the below table are considered to be payable pursuant to "single-trigger" arrangements.

VOTE REQUIRED 

The vote on the Executive Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger
Proposal and vote not to approve the Executive Compensation Proposal or vice versa. Because the vote on the Executive Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not
be binding on the Company. Accordingly, if the Merger Proposal is approved and the Merger is consummated, the compensation payments that are contractually required to
be paid by Cotiviti to its named executive officers will or may be paid, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of this advisory (non-
binding) vote of Cotiviti stockholders.

Approval of the Executive Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our Common Stock representing a majority of the votes cast (excluding
abstentions) at the Special Meeting. Abstentions and broker-non votes will not have an effect on this proposal.

The Cotiviti board of directors will consider the Executive Compensation Proposal to be approved if a majority of the votes cast (excluding abstentions) at the Special Meeting
vote in favor of the proposal.

Approval of this proposal is not a condition to consummation of the Merger.

PROPOSAL NO. 3: THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL

THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL 

We are asking you to approve a proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting, which we refer to as the Adjournment Proposal. If our stockholders
approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting to any date and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of
proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against the Merger Proposal. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment
Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the Merger Proposal such that the Merger Proposal would be
defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the Merger Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in
favor of the Merger Proposal. In addition, the Board (or the chairperson of the Special Meeting) could postpone the Special Meeting before it commences, including if under
our Bylaws a quorum is not present for the meeting.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, under the Merger Agreement, Cotiviti may adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting without Verscend's consent only in certain specified
circumstances as described further under the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—Special Meeting and Related Actions" of this
proxy statement.

If the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time
prior to their use at the Special Meeting as so adjourned or postponed. If a stockholder signs and returns a proxy and does not indicate how he, she or it wishes to vote on
any proposal, or if such stockholder signs and returns a proxy and indicates a vote in favor of the Merger Proposal but does not indicate a choice on the Adjournment
Proposal, such stockholder's shares of our Common Stock will be voted "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal. However, if such stockholder indicates a vote against the Merger
Proposal, such stockholder's shares of our Common Stock will only be voted in favor of the Adjournment Proposal if he, she or it indicates a vote in favor of the Adjournment
Proposal. Cotiviti does not intend to call a vote on the Adjournment Proposal if the Merger Proposal is approved at the Special Meeting.

The vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Proposal and
vote not to approve the Adjournment Proposal and vice versa.

VOTE REQUIRED 

Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of our Common Stock representing a majority of the votes cast (excluding abstentions) at
the Special Meeting. Abstentions and broker-non votes will not have an effect on this proposal.

The Board believes that it is in the best interests of Cotiviti and our stockholders to be able to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting.

Approval of this proposal is not a condition to consummation of the Merger.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

The following table shows information as of July 18, 2018, regarding the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock by:

• each person or group who is known by us to own beneficially more than 5% of our Common Stock; 

• each member of our Board and each of our Named Executive Officers; and 

• all members of our Board and our executive officers as a group.

Beneficial ownership of shares is determined under rules of the SEC and generally includes any shares over which a person exercises sole or shared voting or investment
power. Except as noted by footnote, and subject to community property laws where applicable, we believe based on the information provided to us that the persons and
entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of our Common Stock shown as beneficially owned by them. Percentage
of beneficial ownership is based on 94,037,966 shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting as of July 18, 2018, comprising 93,781,958 shares of
Common Stock issued and outstanding and 256,008 contingently issuable restricted shares of Common Stock outstanding. Shares of Common Stock subject to options
currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of July 18, 2018, and shares of Common Stock underlying restricted stock units subject to vesting within 60 days of
July 18, 2018 (other than those options that would become exercisable, or restricted stock units that would vest, at the Effective Time solely as result of the consummation of
the Merger), are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding the options or restricted stock units for the purposes of computing the percentage of
beneficial ownership of that person and any group of which that person is a member, but are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of
beneficial ownership for any other person. Except as otherwise indicated, the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all
shares of capital stock held by them. Unless

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

If the Merger is consummated, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of our stockholders. However, if the Merger
is not consummated, our stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in meetings of our stockholders.

We intend to hold an Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2019 only if the Merger is not consummated. If the Merger is not consummated, please see below for timing of
stockholder proposals relating to our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Stockholders who intend to have a proposal considered for inclusion in our proxy materials for presentation at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-
8 under the Exchange Act must submit the proposal to our Secretary at our offices at Atlanta, GA in writing not later than December 13, 2018.

Stockholders intending to present a proposal at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, but not to include the proposal in our proxy statement, or to nominate a person for
election as a director, must comply with the requirements set forth in our Bylaws. Our Bylaws require, among other things, that our Secretary receive written notice from the
stockholder of record of their intent to present such proposal or nomination not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day and not later than the close of business on
the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. Therefore, we must receive notice of such a proposal or nomination for the 2019 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders no earlier than the close of business on January 24, 2019 and no later than the close of business on February 23, 2019. The notice must contain the
information required by the Bylaws, a copy of which is available upon request to our Secretary. In the event that the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is more
than 30 days before or more than 60 days after May 24, 2018, then our Secretary must receive such written notice not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day
prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or, if the first
public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public
disclosure of the date of such meeting is first made by us. SEC rules permit management to vote proxies in its discretion in certain cases if the stockholder does not comply
with this deadline and, in certain other cases notwithstanding the stockholder's compliance with this deadline.

We reserve the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these or other applicable requirements.

(a)   Contemporaneously with, or as promptly as practicable after the Closing, the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of

The Merger shall become effective at the date and time the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such other date and time as is
agreed between Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time, the "Effective Time"). As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue its existence as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent under the Laws of the State of Delaware
upon the Effective Time. The Company, in its capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the "Surviving Corporation."

(b)   The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all rights, privileges, powers, franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and
Merger Sub, and all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

(c)   Subject to Section 7.04, at the Effective Time, (i) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall by virtue of the Merger and without further action be
amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of
the corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Company, and (ii) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in their entirety
to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the
name of the Company, in each case, until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and as provided in such certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

(d)   From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation and, unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case, to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their death, resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.

Effective Time (including any shares of Company Common Stock that were issued as restricted Company Common Stock that have become vested on or prior to the Closing
Date, but excluding any Cancelled Shares (as defined below) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into and shall
thereafter represent the right of the holder thereof to receive, an amount in cash equal to $44.75 (forty-four dollars and seventy-five cents) (such amount of cash hereinafter
referred to as the "Merger Consideration"), payable to the holder thereof, without interest and less any withholding Taxes or other amounts required to be withheld therefrom
under Applicable Law, in accordance with Section 3.02.

(b)   From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest and less any
withholding Taxes or other amounts required to be withheld under Applicable Law pursuant to this Article III shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each, a "Certificate") and each holder of a non-certificated share of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry (each, a "Book-Entry Share"), in each case, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time previously representing any such shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and
less any withholding Taxes or other amounts required to be withheld therefrom under Applicable Law.

(c)    Cancellation of Company Common Stock.    At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned directly by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time or held in treasury of the Company (the "Cancelled Shares") shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist and no payment shall be made in respect thereof.

(d)    Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock.    At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(e)    Adjustments.    Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any
change in the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 3.01(e) shall be construed to permit any action that is
otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

Section 3.02    Surrender and Payment     

(a)   Prior to the Effective Time Parent shall select a nationally recognized financial institution (the identity and terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Company) to act as Paying Agent in the Merger (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time represented by a Certificate and each Book-Entry Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case,
other than the Cancelled Shares, restricted shares pursuant to a Company Restricted Stock Award and except for any Dissenting Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit or cause to be deposited (i) with the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid by the Paying
Agent in accordance with this Agreement (such cash shall be referred to in this Agreement as the "Exchange Fund"), and (ii) with the Company, cash in an amount sufficient
such that the Company has sufficient cash on hand to pay the aggregate Option Consideration and RS/RSU Consideration in accordance with this Agreement (such cash
shall be referred to in this Agreement as the "Compensatory Award Fund"). In the event the Exchange Fund or the Compensatory Award Fund shall be insufficient to make
the payments in connection with the Merger contemplated by Section 3.01 or Section 3.05, respectively, Parent shall promptly deposit or cause to be deposited additional
cash with the Paying Agent or the Company, as applicable, in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount required pay the Merger Consideration, the Option
Consideration or the RS/RSU Consideration, as applicable. The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be
issued pursuant to Section 3.01 out of the Exchange Fund. The Surviving Corporation or an Acquired Company, as applicable, shall pay through payroll (subject to
withholding and deductions required by Applicable Law) the Option Consideration and RS/RSU Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 3.05 out of the
Compensatory Award Fund. The Exchange Fund and the Compensatory Award Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b)   As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Effective Time, Parent will cause
the Paying Agent to send to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common
Stock (other than the Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to the Paying Agent) in such
form as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Paying Agent, and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration in such form
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree.

(c)   Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of
transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange therefor, as
promptly as practicable (but in any event within two (2) Business Days), the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the appropriate amount of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required
by the Paying Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred, and the Person requesting such payment

shall pay, or cause to be paid, any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

(d)   Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") to ensure
that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in
cash in immediately available funds equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration (such amount, the "DTC Payment"), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on the Closing Date, the Paying
Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first (1st) Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

(e)    Registered Holders.    If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer Taxes required by reason of the making of such cash
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(f)    No Transfers; No Further Ownership.    After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article III.

(g)    Termination of Exchange Fund.    Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock after the date which is
one (1) year following the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent upon demand. Any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has not exchanged his, her or its
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the
Merger Consideration in respect of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock. Parent shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in
connection with the exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any Acquired Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Compensatory Awards for any Merger Consideration,
Option Consideration or RS/RSU Consideration that is required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h)    Investment of Exchange Fund.    The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation; provided that (i) no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this

Article III, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock in the amount
required to ensure the Exchange Fund has sufficient cash to pay any remaining Merger Consideration required to be paid hereunder, (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America.
Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to Parent or its designee as directed by Parent.

(i)    All Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and RS/RSU Consideration issued or paid upon conversion of the Company Common Stock, the Company Options, the
Company Restricted Stock Awards or the Company RSU Awards, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock, Company Options, the Company Restricted Stock Awards or Company RSU Awards, as the
case may be.

Section 3.03    Lost Certificates.     If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a customary bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably necessary, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect
of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article III.

Section 3.04    Withholding Rights.     Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Acquired Companies and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable or deliverable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation consideration payable to any holder or
former holder of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards or Company RSU Awards, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment pursuant to the Code or under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law or otherwise under any Applicable Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld and, if required by Applicable Law, paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, an Acquired Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.05    Treatment of Company Compensatory Awards, Company ESPPs.     

(a)    Company Options.    Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised shall (i) vest in full, and (ii) by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option (the "Option
Consideration"), subject to reduction for any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by Applicable Law to be withheld. Each holder of an outstanding Company Option
shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the cancellation thereof the Option Consideration, if any, and Parent shall cause such payment to be made to the holder of such
Company Option through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation or an Acquired Company, as applicable, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and in no
event later than the next

price per share of any Company Option, whether vested or unvested as of the Effective Time, is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then by virtue of the
occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders thereof, the Company Option will automatically
terminate and be canceled without payment of any consideration to the holder thereof.

(b)    Company RSU Awards and Company Restricted Stock Awards.    Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that remains
outstanding and each Company Restricted Stock Award that remains outstanding and unvested shall (i) vest in full, and (ii) by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, be cancelled and terminated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock (A) underlying such Company RSU Award or
(B) granted pursuant to such Restricted Stock Award, as applicable and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the "RS/RSU Consideration"), subject to reduction for any applicable
withholding or other Taxes required by Applicable Law to be withheld. Each holder of an outstanding Company RSU Award and/or Company Restricted Stock Award shall be
entitled to receive in exchange for the cancellation thereof the RS/RSU Consideration and Parent shall cause such payment to be made to the holder of such Company RSU
Award or Company Restricted Stock Award, as applicable, through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation or an Acquired Company, as applicable, as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date (and in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation or an Acquired Company, as applicable,
following the Closing Date).

(c)    Company ESPPs.    Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the Company ESPPs that are necessary to provide that, subject to the
consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPPs shall terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the termination of the
Company ESPPs, any funds that remain within the associated accumulated payroll withholding account for each participant shall be returned to such participant. With respect
to any offering period outstanding as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPPs, promptly following the date of this Agreement, each option granted pursuant
to the Company ESPPs shall be deemed to have been exercised upon the earlier to occur of (A) the day that is four (4) Business Days prior to the Effective Time or (B) the
date on which such offering period would otherwise end, and no additional offering period shall commence under the Company ESPPs after the date of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Effective Time does not occur prior to the End Date, the Company and Parent agree to negotiate in good faith to permit the
commencement of new offering periods under the Company ESPPs.

(d)    Certain Actions.    Not less than ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall send a written notice to each holder of an outstanding Company Option,
Company Restricted Stock Award or Company RSU Award and to each participant in any Company ESPP that shall inform such holder or participant of the treatment of the
Company Compensatory Awards provided in this Section 3.05. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, as applicable, any committee thereof administering any of
the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as it deems necessary or advisable to effectuate the treatment of Company
Compensatory Awards set forth in this Section 3.05. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that the Surviving Corporation will
not be bound at the Effective Time by any options, stock appreciation rights, units or other right, awards or arrangements under any stock incentive plan of the Company that
would entitle any Person after the Effective Time to beneficially own any Company Common Stock (or any derivative securities thereof) or to receive any payments in respect
thereof, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that are necessary to provide that, subject to the
consummation of the Merger, the Company's 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan shall terminate effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

Section 3.06    Dissenting Shares.     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock held by a holder
who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to appraisal (each such share, a "Dissenting Share"), if any, such Dissenting Shares shall not be
converted into a right to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration and the holders thereof shall be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL.
Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the DGCL; provided, however, that (x) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the
DGCL, affirmatively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent or its right for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (y) if any holder of
Dissenting Shares fails to establish his, her or its entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL or (z) if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of
Company Common Stock and such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares, and each such share of Company Common
Stock shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive, without interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company will give Parent prompt written notice (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) of all
written demands received by the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
Applicable Law and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Shares. Parent shall have the right to direct and control all negotiations and Proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting
Shares. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 3.02(a) to pay for any shares that are Dissenting Shares shall be
returned to Parent upon demand.

of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all corporate power and authority required to carry on its business as currently conducted, except where the failure to have such
power and authority would not materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and, where such concept is recognized, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the Transactions.

Section 5.02    Corporate Authorization     

(a)   Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub (subject, with respect to Merger Sub, only to approval by its sole stockholder, which will be effected by written consent
immediately following the execution of this Agreement), and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent and Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or for each of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

(b)   The board of directors or similar governing body of each of Parent and Merger Sub has duly adopted resolutions (i) determining that this Agreement and the Transactions
are advisable and in the best interests of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective stockholders or other equityholders, as applicable and (ii) adopting this Agreement and the
Transactions. Parent, acting in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will immediately after execution hereof approve and adopt this Agreement.

(c)   Except as set forth on Section 5.02(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, no vote of, or consent by, the holders of any equity interests of Parent is necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance by Parent of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise required by Parent's organizational documents,
Applicable Law or any Governmental Authority.

filings would not materially impair or delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions.

Section 5.04    Non-Contravention.     The execution, delivery and performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement, the consummation by each of Parent
or Merger Sub of the Transactions and the compliance by each of Parent or Merger Sub with any of the provisions of this Agreement does not and will not (i) contravene,
conflict with or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of Parent or Merger
Sub, (ii) assuming the consents, approvals, authorizations, filings and notices referred to in Section 5.03 have been obtained or made, any applicable waiting periods referred
to therein have terminated or expired and any condition precedent to any such consent has been satisfied or waived, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach
of any Applicable Law or (iii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.03, require any consent by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event
that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right
or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any Contract, except in the case of clause (ii) and clause (iii) above, any such
violation, breach, default, right, termination, amendment, acceleration, cancellation or loss that would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair or delay the ability
of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions.

Section 5.05    Litigation.     As of the date of this Agreement, there are not any material Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions. There is no unsatisfied
judgment or any open injunction binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Transactions.

Section 5.06    No Brokers.     There is no investment banker, broker, finder or other financial intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of any
of Parent or its Subsidiaries who will be entitled to any fee or commission from Parent or its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, in connection with the Transactions.

Section 5.07    Ownership of Company Capital Stock.     

(a)   Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries do not beneficially own (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) any shares
of Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock or other securities of, or any
other economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Company.

vote against, or not to tender its shares of Company Common Stock in, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any Third Party has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, equity
capital to Parent to finance in whole or in part the Merger other than the Equity Commitment Letter and the Preferred Equity Financing.

Section 5.08    Financial Capacity.     Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (a) an executed equity commitment letter dated the date hereof (the
"Equity Commitment Letter"), to provide the Equity Financing in cash in an aggregate amount of at least $790,000,000, (b) an executed preferred equity commitment letter
dated the date hereof (as amended, supplemented or replaced in compliance with this Agreement or as required by Section 7.14 following a Financing Failure Event, the
"Preferred Equity Commitment Letter"), to provide the Preferred Equity Financing in cash in an aggregate amount of at least $575,000,000, and (c) the executed Debt
Commitment Letter. None of the Commitment Letters have been amended or modified in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or other commitment or arrangement relating to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing or the conditionality, enforceability, termination or availability of the Financing, other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters and the fee letters and engagement
letter related thereto, as applicable. The aggregate proceeds of the Debt Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or all "market flex" provisions
related thereto), the Equity Financing and the Preferred Equity Financing will be sufficient to consummate the Transactions, including the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, Option Consideration and RS/RSU Consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards and
Company RSU Awards will be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, and to pay all fees and expenses required to be paid by Verscend Holding, Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions. As of the date of this Agreement, the commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. The Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and represent valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Verscend Holding and, to the
Knowledge of Parent and the knowledge of Verscend Holding, each other party thereto (subject to the Enforceability Exceptions) to provide the financing contemplated
thereby subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions. Verscend Holding has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other
amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of Verscend Holding or, to the Knowledge of Parent or the knowledge of Verscend
Holding, any other party to the Commitment Letters, in each case under any term of the Commitment Letters. Assuming (x) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article IV (subject to all Company Material Adverse Effect, materiality and knowledge qualifications contained therein), (y) the performance by the
Company and its Subsidiaries of the covenants set forth in Section 7.13 and (z) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to
consummate the Merger, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Verscend Holding have no reason to believe that Verscend Holding or any other party thereto will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of any of the Commitment Letters. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing other than the Financing Conditions. The only conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the Debt Financing on the
Closing Date that will be included in the Debt Financing Documents shall be the Financing Conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming (x) the accuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in Article IV (subject to all materiality and knowledge qualifications contained therein), (y) the performance by the Company and
its Subsidiaries of the covenants set forth in Section 7.13 and (z) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the
Merger, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Verscend Holding have no reason to believe that (i) any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied or (ii) the
Financing will not be made available to Verscend Holding on the Closing Date. Parent and Merger Sub expressly agree and acknowledge that their obligations hereunder,

Sub's obligations to consummate the Merger, are not subject to, or conditioned on, Verscend Holding's, Parent's or Merger Sub's receipt of financing.

Section 5.09    Solvency.     Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the Transactions with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors
of any Acquired Company. Assuming (x) the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article IV (without regard to any of the Company Material Adverse
Effect, materiality and knowledge qualifications contained therein), (y) the performance in all material respects by the Company and its Subsidiaries of the covenants set forth
in Section 7.13 and (z) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02, as of the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will, after giving effect to all of the Transactions, including the payment of any amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions and the payment of all related fees and expenses, be solvent at and immediately after the Effective Time. As used in this Section 5.09, the term "solvent"
means, with respect to a particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of Parent and Merger Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will exceed their debts, (b) each of Parent and Merger Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries have not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature, and (c) each of Parent and Merger Sub and, after the Merger, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, has sufficient capital and liquidity with which to conduct its business.

Section 5.10    Information in the Proxy Statement.     The information supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (and any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto) will not, at the date mailed to the Company's stockholders and at the time of the meeting of the Company's stockholders to be held
in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. However, Parent and Merger Sub do not make any representations or
warranties with respect to information in the Proxy Statement that is not supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, or that is
inconsistent with information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.

Section 5.11    Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities.     All of the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares, par value $0.01 per share, all of
which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Merger Sub are, and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly by Parent.
Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with its formation, this Agreement,
the Voting Agreement and the Transactions, Merger Sub has not and will not prior to the Effective Time have incurred, directly or indirectly, any obligations or liabilities or
engaged in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any Person.

Section 5.12    Company Arrangements.     Other than this Agreement and as may be provided pursuant to the Voting Agreement, as of the date hereof, none of Parent or
Merger Sub, or their respective executive officers, directors or Affiliates, has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any of the executive officers,
directors or Affiliates of the Company relating in any way to the Transactions or the operations of the Company.

Section 5.13    Investment Intention.     Parent is acquiring through the Transactions the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account, for
investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution (as such term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof. Parent understands that the shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation have not been registered under the Securities Act or any "blue sky" Laws and cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under
the Securities Act, any applicable "blue sky" Laws or pursuant to an exemption from any such registration.

Acquired Companies made available to any Third Party shall, to the extent not previously made available to Parent, be made available to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is made available to such Third Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the

(c)   Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.02(c), Section 6.02(d) or Section 6.02(e), until the earlier of the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company

to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; (iii) fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within four (4) Business Days of receipt of
a written request from Parent to do so (it being agreed that neither the delivery of a notice by the Company described in Section 6.02(d) nor any public announcement thereof
shall constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change); (iv) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, fail to recommend against any Company Acquisition Proposal
within four (4) Business Days of receipt of a written request from Parent to do so (it being agreed that neither the delivery of a notice by the Company described in
Section 6.02(d) nor any public announcement thereof shall constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change); (v) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a

stockholders); (vi) approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of
the actions described in clause (i) through clause (vi) of this Section 6.02(c), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"); or (vii) adopt or approve, or cause or permit the
Company to enter into or otherwise resolve or agree to any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 6.02(b)(iii).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if at any time prior to the receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval, (A) the Company Board
may, subject to first complying with Section 6.02(d) or Section 6.02(e) , as applicable, make an Adverse Recommendation Change (i) in response to an Intervening Event or
(ii) if the Company Board receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.02 (other
than any breach that is both immaterial and unintentional) and, in the case of each of clause (i) and clause (ii), the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial and outside legal advisors, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties to the
Company's stockholders under Applicable Law and (B) in the event the Company Board receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal after the date of this
Agreement that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.02 (other than any breach that is both immaterial and unintentional) and the Company Board determines in good

Section 9.01(h) and enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement in connection with such Superior Proposal, if and only if the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties to the Company's stockholders under Applicable Law, subject to the Company first complying with Section 6.02(d) and substantially concurrently with entering into any
such definitive agreement (1) the Company validly terminates this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.01(h) and (2) the Company pays the Company
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 9.03(b).

(d)   The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal or validly terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.01(h) unless (i) the Company has provided, at least three (3) Business Days in advance, written notice (a "Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change") to
Parent that the Company intends to take such action (it being understood that the delivery of a Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, amendment or update will not, by itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice includes,
written notice of the material terms of the Superior Proposal which enabled the Company Board to make the determination that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal; (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period following the time of Parent's receipt of the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Commitment Letters and the Transactions so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal such that the failure to take such action
would no longer be inconsistent with the director's fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under Applicable Law; and (iii) following the end of the three (3) Business
Day period described in the preceding clause (ii), the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, after
considering in good faith any changes to this Agreement, the Commitment Letters and the Transactions offered by Parent in response to the Notice of Adverse
Recommendation Change or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change continues to constitute a Superior Proposal
and that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the director's fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under Applicable Law. In the event of any
amendment or modification to the amount or form of consideration payable in connection with the Superior Proposal or any material amendment or modification to any other
term of the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to issue a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change or otherwise comply again with the requirements of
this Section 6.02(d); provided, however, that for purposes of this sentence, references to the three (3) Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to a two
(2) Business Day period from the time of Parent's receipt of such new Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change.

(e)   Other than in connection with effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal or causing the Company to validly terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(h) and enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement (which, in each case, shall be subject to Section 6.02(d) and shall not be subject
to this Section 6.02(e) ), the Company Board may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, only if, prior to such action (i) the
Company has provided, at least three (3) Business Days in advance, a Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change to Parent that the Company intends to take such action
(it being understood that the delivery of a Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change and any amendment or update thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice,
amendment or update will not, by itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), which notice includes, a reasonably detailed summary of the facts, events and/or
circumstances of and relating to the Intervening Event and the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change; (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period following the
time of Parent's receipt of the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its

Commitment Letters and the Transactions such that the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the director's fiduciary duties to the Company's
stockholders under Applicable Law; and (iii) following the end of the three (3) Business Day period described in the preceding clause (ii), the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, after considering in good faith any changes to this Agreement, the Commitment

Party, the Company shall provide Parent with written notice of the identity of such Third Party and the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request,
offer or inquiry and, in the case of written materials (including any financing commitments received), provide Parent copies of all such materials, (ii) as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) make available to Parent copies of all materials provided by the Company to such Third Party but not previously

Parent informed of material oral or written communications regarding, and the status and material details (including material amendments or proposed material amendments)
of, any such Acquisition Proposal or other request, offer or inquiry.

(g)   Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i) disclosing to the
Company's stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or
any similar communication to the Company's stockholders) (provided that such disclosure does not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), (ii) making any "stop,
look and listen" communication to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (iii) making any other legally required
communication to the Company's stockholders with regard to the Transactions if (in the case of this clause (iii)) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
Applicable Law; provided, however, that (A) in no event shall this Section 6.02(g) affect the obligations specified in Section 6.02(c) and (B) any such disclosure (other than
making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) that addresses or relates to
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board with respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change, unless the Company Board in connection with such communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this

sole cost and expense; provided, further, that nothing herein shall require the Acquired Companies to disclose any information to Parent or its Representatives if such
disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) violate Applicable Law or the provisions of any Contract (including any confidentiality agreement or similar
agreement or arrangement) to which any Acquired Company is a party or (ii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege (it being agreed that, with respect to

consents and clearances as may be necessary, proper or advisable under any Applicable Laws and (B) prevent the entry in any action or proceeding brought by a
Governmental Authority or any other Person of any Governmental Order which would prohibit, make unlawful or delay the consummation of the Transactions. Each party
hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted pursuant to this Section 7.01(b) to a Governmental Authority in connection with the
Merger or any of the other Transactions. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by Applicable Law, in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding, each party hereto will permit Representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted
pursuant to this Section 7.01 to any Governmental Authority in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding.

(c)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent related to any Applicable Law, Parent shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to) cooperate in good faith with the Governmental Authorities and shall undertake (and cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to undertake)
promptly any and all action to complete lawfully the Transactions as soon as practicable (but in any event prior to the End Date) and any and all action necessary or advisable
to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual or threatened commencement of any Proceeding in any forum by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority or the issuance
of any Governmental Order that would (or to obtain the agreement or consent of any Governmental Authority to the Transactions the absence of which would) delay, enjoin,
prevent, restrain or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger, including (i) proffering and consenting and/or agreeing to a Governmental Order or other agreement
providing for the sale, licensing or other disposition, or the holding separate of, or other limitations or restrictions on, or limiting any freedom of action with respect to, particular
assets, categories of assets or lines of business and (ii) promptly effecting the disposition, licensing or holding separate of assets or lines of business, in each case, at such
time as may be necessary to permit the lawful consummation of the Transactions on or prior to the End Date. The entry by any Governmental Authority in any Proceeding of a
Governmental Order permitting the consummation of the Transactions but requiring any assets or lines of business to be sold, licensed or otherwise disposed or held
separate thereafter (including with respect to the business and assets of the Acquired Companies) shall not, individually, or in the aggregate (together with one or more other
changes, events, circumstances, developments or facts) be deemed a failure to satisfy any condition specified in Article VIII.

(d)   Each party hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate with the other parties as to any Government Contract administration matters that may arise prior
to the Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate with the other (or its designee) in addressing
inquiries from CMS regarding the Transaction and, in the event CMS requests an updated organizational conflict of interest disclosure, will reasonably consult with the other
(or its designee) to prepare and submit such updated disclosure.

(e)   Parent shall be solely responsible for and pay all filing costs associated with all required filings under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law.

Section 7.02    Proxy Statement     

(a)   As promptly as reasonably practicable, but, assuming Parent's timely performance of its obligations under Section 7.02(b), the Company shall prepare a proxy statement
in preliminary form, as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") and shall cause the Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
such filing to be made with the SEC within fifteen (15) Business Days following the date of this Agreement. Except as contemplated by Section 6.02, the Proxy Statement
shall include the Company Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or
the staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand. Each of the parties hereto shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts so that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as of the record date
established for the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in no event more than five Business Days after the date on
which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Company stockholders (if applicable) and at
the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or
misleading; provided, however that (i) notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and (ii) updates thereafter in responses to claims shall not per se be deemed to be a
breach for purposes of this Section 7.02(a). Prior to filing and prior to mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments
(whether written, oral or otherwise) of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and its Representatives a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response in advance (including the proposed final version of such document or response) to the extent
not prohibited by Applicable Law, and no amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement shall be filed without the approval of the Company and Parent, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that the Company may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement without the review or
comment of Parent in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with this Agreement.

(b)   Parent shall furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of
comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC). Parent will, upon request of the Company, confirm and/or supplement the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub
supplied by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, such that at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of
the Company Stockholders Meeting, such information shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(c)   In accordance with the Company's organizational documents, Applicable Law and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (but subject to the timing contemplated in Section 7.02(a)), (x) establish a record date for, duly call and give notice of a meeting of its stockholders, for
the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "Company Stockholder Meeting") and (y) mail to the
holders of Company Common Stock as of the record date established for the Company Stockholders Meeting a Proxy Statement. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to duly call, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting on or around the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to
Company stockholders; provided, however, that the Company may postpone, recess or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting: (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the
absence of a quorum, (iii) if the Company reasonably believes it is necessary to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Required Company Stockholder
Approval, or (iv) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is necessary under Applicable Laws and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and
reviewed by the Company's stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. In no event will the record date of the Company Stockholder Meeting be changed
without Parent's prior written consent, unless required by Applicable Law. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter
(other than matters of procedure and matters required by Applicable Law to be voted on by the Company's stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement)
that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Unless the Company Board shall have effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to secure the Required Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a
reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following dissemination of the definitive Proxy Statement. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to and in accordance with Section 9.01, the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder
Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement, whether or not the Company Board at any time subsequent to the date hereof shall have effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change.

(d)   If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of the Company's or Parent's Subsidiaries,
or their respective officers or directors, is discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, such party shall promptly inform
the others, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared by the Company and (subject to Parent's review and comment as
described above) filed with the SEC, and to the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

(e)   If the Company determines that it is required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant to Applicable Law
(such document, as amended or supplemented, an "Other Required Company Filing"), then the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file
such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. Any and all Other Required Company
Filings shall be subject to same right of review, comment and notice of Parent provided above with respect to the Proxy Statement.

Section 7.03    Confidentiality; Public Announcements.     The parties shall issue a joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement and agree that such
initial press release shall be in the form agreed to by the parties. Thereafter, prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise expressly contemplated by Section 6.02 (and for
the avoidance of doubt nothing herein shall limit the rights of the Company or the Company Board under Section 6.02), prior to any Adverse Recommendation Change made
in accordance with this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or public announcement with respect
to this Agreement or the Transactions, and none of the parties or their Affiliates shall issue any such press release or public announcement prior to obtaining the other parties'
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except that no such consent shall be necessary (a) to the extent disclosure may be required by
Applicable Law, Governmental Order or applicable national stock exchange rule, (b) for disclosures made in the ordinary course by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates to their existing or prospective investors and limited partners, in each case who are subject to customary confidentiality restrictions, or (c) in connection with any
actions by the Company or the Company Board expressly permitted by Section 6.02. The Company may, without Parent's or Merger Sub's consent, communicate to its
employees, customers, suppliers and consultants in a manner consistent with prior communications of the Company or consistent with a communications plan previously
agreed to by Parent and the Company in which case such communications may be made only to the extent such communications are substantially consistent with such prior
communications or such plan, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth therein or herein, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect until the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the foregoing nor any other provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to limit any customary disclosure made
by Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates to the Financing Sources and rating agencies in connection with efforts or activities by Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the
Financing.

Section 7.04    Indemnification of Officers and Directors.     

(a)   From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of the Acquired
Companies against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Acquired Companies, as the case may be, would have
been required by Applicable Law and their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws, indemnification agreements or other organizational documents, in each case, in
effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person. Parent also agrees to advance expenses as incurred by each present and former director, officer and
employee of the Acquired Companies to the fullest extent required by Applicable Law and their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws, indemnification agreements or
other organizational documents, in each case, in effect on the date of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall cause the Acquired Companies with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time: (i) to maintain for a period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions in their respective
certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents concerning the indemnification and exculpation (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of the Acquired Companies' former and current officers, directors and employees that are no less favorable to those Persons than the requirements under
Applicable Law and the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, indemnification agreements, and other organizational documents of the Acquired Companies, as applicable, in
each case, as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely affect in any material
respect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Applicable Law.

(b)   The Company shall cause coverage to be extended under the current directors' and officers' liability insurance by obtaining at or prior to the Closing Date a prepaid, non-
cancelable six (6)-year "tail" insurance policy with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.

(c)   Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 7.04 shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding,
jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04.

(d)   Parent shall cause the Acquired Companies to honor, each of the covenants in this Section 7.04.

Section 7.05    Section 16 Matters.     Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as are required to cause the disposition of Company Common Stock,
Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards, Company RSU Awards or other securities in connection with the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act.

Section 7.06    Stockholder Litigation.     The Company shall reasonably promptly advise Parent of, and keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis regarding, any
stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors or officers relating to the Transactions, whether commenced prior to or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement; provided, that, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity (at Parent's sole cost and expense) to participate in the defense or settlement of any such
stockholder litigation; provided, further, that the Company shall not settle or offer to settle any such stockholder litigation without the prior written consent of Parent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 7.07    Employee Matters     

(a)   For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain for each employee who continues in the employ
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (each, a "Continuing Employee"), (i) base salary, target cash incentive opportunity
and severance benefits (with respect to severance benefits, to the extent set forth in an Employee Plan listed in Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter), in each
case, that are not less than those provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefits (including retirement, health and welfare
benefits, but excluding defined benefit pension benefits, retiree health and life insurance benefits and equity compensation) which are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing. This Section 7.07 shall not limit the obligation of Parent to maintain any
compensation arrangement or benefit plan that, pursuant to an existing Contract, must be maintained for a period longer than one (1) year. No provision of this Agreement
shall be construed as a guarantee of continued employment of any Continuing Employee and this Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee, provided that any such termination is effected in accordance with Applicable
Law.

(b)   From and after the Closing, Parent shall give each Continuing Employee full credit for his or her years of service with the Company for all purposes (including for
purposes of eligibility to participate, level of benefits, early retirement eligibility and early retirement subsidies, vesting and benefit accrual) under any

employee benefit plans, arrangements, collective agreements and employment-related entitlements (including under any applicable pension, 401(k), savings, medical, dental,
life insurance, vacation, long-service leave or other leave entitlements, termination indemnity, severance or separation pay plans) provided, sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for such Continuing Employee's service with any Acquired Company, and with any predecessor employer, to the same
extent recognized by the Acquired Companies, except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent permitted under Applicable Law, Parent shall not be required to provide credit for such service for benefit accrual or eligibility purposes under any
employee benefit plan of Parent that is a defined benefit pension plan or a post-retirement health and life insurance plan.

(c)   Parent shall (i) waive for each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents, any waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-existing
condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under the welfare plans of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other restriction would
not have been applicable to such Continuing Employee under the terms of the welfare plans of the Acquired Companies, and (ii) give full credit under the welfare plans of
Parent and its Subsidiaries applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same
plan year as the Closing, and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single continuous employer.

(d)   If requested by Parent at least ten (10) Business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company's tax-qualified
defined contribution retirement plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan"), or cause such plan to be terminated, effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, and provide that participants in the Company 401(k) Plan shall become fully vested in any unvested portion of their
Company 401(k) Plan accounts as of the date such plan is terminated. If such request to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan is made, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated (effective no later than immediately prior to the Closing Date and contingent on the Closing) pursuant to
resolutions of the Company. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to prior review by Parent. If the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated, Parent shall
designate a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan with a cash or deferred arrangement that is sponsored by the Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (the "Parent
401(k) Plan") that will cover Continuing Employees effective as of the Effective Time. In connection with the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, Parent shall cause the
Parent 401(k) Plan to accept from the Company 401(k) Plan the "direct rollover" of the account balance (including the in-kind rollover of promissory notes evidencing all
outstanding loans) of each Continuing Employee who participated in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan is terminated and who elects such direct rollover in
accordance with the terms of the Company 401(k) Plan and the Code. The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to take any and all commercially
reasonable actions needed to permit each Continuing Employee with an outstanding loan balance under the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan is terminated to
continue to make scheduled loan payments to the Company 401(k) Plan after the Closing, pending the distribution and in-kind rollover of the promissory notes evidencing
such loans from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan, as provided in the preceding sentence, such as to prevent, to the extent reasonably possible, a deemed
distribution or loan offset with respect to such outstanding loans.

(e)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) require Parent to continue any incentive or
benefit plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time or (ii) be treated as an amendment or other modification of any incentive or
benefit plan. The provisions of this Section 7.07 are solely for the benefit

Transactions pursuant to the terms of any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Parent so
requests and at the sole expense of Parent, the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to pay any such fee or grant any such concession (subject in the case of
concessions to being conditioned on Closing) in order to obtain any such consents (and Parent shall provide the Company with such amounts in order to make any such
payment).

Section 7.09    Notices of Certain Events.     The Company shall, after becoming aware, give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub in writing of: (i) (x) any representation

Agreement or the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, and (ii) any Proceedings
commenced or, to such party's Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to this

reasonably necessary to cause the Company's securities to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act following the Effective Time in compliance
with Applicable Law (provided, that such de-listing and de-registration shall not be effective until after the Effective Time).

on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business, or incur or guarantee any
indebtedness or make any investments, other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise as required in connection with the Transactions.

Section 7.12    Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger.     Parent and Merger Sub covenant and agree that, between the date of this Agreement and the
earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall not permit any of
their controlled Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other
manner, any business of any Person or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets if such business competes in any
line of business of the Acquired Companies and the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation could
reasonably be expected to (a) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or material increase in the risk of not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order, declaration or
approval of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (b) materially increase
the risk of any Governmental Authority entering a Governmental Order prohibiting the consummation of Transactions, (c) materially increase the risk of not being able to

Holding shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefor, (ii) obtain alternative financing from alternative Financing Sources (on
terms containing no new or additional conditions to the consummation of such financing), in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, Option

modification, supplement or replacement that does not (A) add new (or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any
portion of the Debt Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent, or make less likely to occur, the funding of
the Debt Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing) on the Closing Date,
(B) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or the Preferred Equity Financing below the amount (together with the amount from the Equity Financing) required to

(d)    Parent Termination Fee.    If, but only if, this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(f) or Section 9.01(i), or (y) by Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 9.01(b) under circumstances when this Agreement is terminable by the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(f) or Section 9.01(i), then Parent
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Parent Termination Fee within five (5) Business Days following such termination (but, in the case of valid termination
pursuant to Section 9.01(b), within five (5) Business Days of the good faith written claim that termination could have occurred under Section 9.01(f) or Section 9.01(i)).

(e)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to (x) the indemnification and reimbursement obligations set forth in Section 7.13(c) and (y) an
order of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by Section 10.02, the Company's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this
Article IX and receive from Parent the Parent Termination Fee, if due pursuant to Section 9.03(d), shall, in the event Parent and Merger Sub fail to effect the Closing or
otherwise breach this Agreement or fail to perform hereunder (whether willful, intentional or otherwise), constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against
(i) Parent, (ii) Merger Sub, (iii) any of Parent's and any of its Subsidiaries' (including Merger Sub's) former, current and future Affiliates and (iv) any of their respective
assignees, stockholders, general or limited partners, equityholders, members, managers, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Financing
Sources and other Representatives (the Persons described in clause (i), clause (ii), clause (iii) and clause (iv) collectively, the "Parent Parties") for any breach, loss, claim,
liability, cost, fee, expense, judgment, inquiry, fine or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions (including the Commitment Letters, but excluding the Confidentiality Agreement (solely
subject to the terms therein, as may have been modified by this Agreement from time to time)), and upon payment of (A) the Parent Termination Fee (if payable), plus (B) the
reimbursement obligations set forth in Section 7.13(c), plus (C) such indemnification and reimbursement and interest amounts, if any, referenced in Section 9.03(g), no
Person shall have any rights or claims against the Parent Parties under this Agreement or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in contract in tort or otherwise, and the Parent
Parties shall not have any other liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transaction. Nothing in this Section 9.03(e) shall in any way expand or be deemed or
construed to expand the circumstances in which Parent or any other Parent Party may be liable under this Agreement or the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) the
amounts the Company is entitled to collect, if due, are those specified in clause (A), clause (B), and clause (C), as applicable and are intended to serve as a cap on the
maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Parties under this Agreement in the event Parent fails to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 2.01 or otherwise breaches
this Agreement or fails to perform hereunder and under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to collect, if due, more than the amounts specified in such clauses,
and (y) while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 10.02 and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 9.03(d), as the case may be, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to
consummate the Transaction pursuant to Section 10.02 and monetary damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee.

(f)    Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in Section 9.02 and Section 9.03 are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor the Company would enter into this Agreement. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall (x) the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee or any other amounts due under Section 9.03(g) on more than one occasion or (y) Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee or any of the reimbursement, interest or other amounts due under Section 7.13(c) and Section 9.03(g) on more than one occasion.

(g)   Any amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.03(a), Section 9.03(b), Section 9.03(d) or this Section 9.03(g) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with this Section 9.03 to an account designated by Parent or the Company, as applicable (at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date such fee is to be paid).
If the Company or Parent, as applicable, fails to pay when due any amount payable under Section 9.03(a), Section 9.03(b) or Section 9.03(d), as applicable, and in order to
collect such amount, Parent or the Company, as applicable, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the Company Termination Fee or Parent for
the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, then such party shall (x) reimburse the other for all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with such suit and (y) pay interest on the applicable reimbursement or fee to the other party at the prime lending rate
prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to the date of actual payment.

Section 10.02    Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance.     

(a)   The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur, and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including, subject to Section 10.02(b), failing to take such actions as
are required of it hereunder to consummate the Transactions). It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be, subject to Section 10.02(b) (including the limitations therein),
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity. Subject to the
terms of Section 10.02(b), each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other
party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to

prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. To the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or
proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that expressly
survives termination of this Agreement), the End Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of such action, suit or
proceeding or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding (it being understood that this Section 10.02 is not intended
and shall not be construed to limit in any way the provisions of Section 9.03(c) or Section 9.03(e).

(b)   Notwithstanding Section 10.02(a) or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction or specific performance, prior to
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX, of Parent's obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and thereafter to cause the Closing to occur
if, and only if: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but provided that such conditions are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur on such date and the date on
which the Closing would occur if the remedy herein were granted), (ii) the Preferred Equity Financing and the Debt Financing (including any alternative financing that has
been obtained in accordance with Section 7.13) has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof, or are capable of being funded in accordance with the terms thereof at
the Closing upon delivery of a drawdown notice by Parent or notice from Parent that the Equity Financing will be funded at the Closing, (iii) Parent and Merger Sub are
required to consummate the Transactions in accordance with Section 2.01 and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that it is ready, willing and able
to consummate the Closing and if such specific performance is granted pursuant to this Section 10.02 and if the Equity Financing, Preferred Equity Financing and Debt
Financing are funded, then the Closing would occur.

Section 10.03    No Survival of Representations and Warranties.     The representations and warranties and covenants and agreements (to the extent such covenant or
agreement contemplates or requires performance prior to the Closing) in this Agreement and in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto by any Person shall
terminate at the Effective Time, except that this Section 10.03 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates performance in whole
or in part after the Effective Time.

Section 10.04    Amendments and Waivers     

(a)   Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of
an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, however, that no amendment
or waiver shall be made subsequent to receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval which requires further approval of the stockholders of the Company pursuant
to the DGCL or the organizational documents of the Company without such further stockholder approval; provided, further, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, this Section 10.04, and Section 10.06, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 and Section 10.13 (and any related definitions to the extent a modification,
waiver or termination of such definitions would modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is
adverse in any material respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources party to the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the
Debt Commitment Letter.

(b)   No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 10.05    Disclosure Letter References.     The parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure
Letter, as the case may be, shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants,
as applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other representations and warranties (or covenant, as
applicable) of such party that are contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties (or covenant, as applicable) would be reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other
representations and warranties (or covenant, as applicable) notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross reference thereto. The listing of any information on a party's
Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information or any similar
information in such Disclosure Letter, by such party, or to otherwise imply, that such information or any similar information is material, is required to be disclosed by such party
under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in a party's Disclosure Letter relating to
any possible breach or violation by such party of any Contract or Applicable Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or
has actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in a party's Disclosure Letter be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of such party's representations,
warranties and/or covenants set forth in this Agreement.

Section 10.06    Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.     

(a)   This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure solely to the benefit of and be enforceable by each party hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the past, present and future officers, directors and employees of the Acquired Companies (and
their successors and heirs) are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, Section 7.04 applicable to such Persons and (ii) from and after the Effective Time, the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock and holders of Company Compensatory Awards shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, the rights of
such Persons to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and RS/RSU Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to and in accordance with Article III;
(iii) the Company Parties and Parent Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries with respect to Section 9.03; and (iv) the Financing Sources are hereby made express third-
party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on this Section 10.06 and Section 10.04, Section 10.07, Section 10.08, Section 10.09 and Section 10.13.

(b)   Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto by operation of Applicable Law or otherwise
without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub (or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) may assign any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations hereunder to one or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or a combination thereof, and Parent shall have the right, without
the prior written consent of the Company, to assign all or any portion of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to Verscend Holding or one or more Subsidiaries of
Verscend Holding, provided that such assignment would not materially delay, impair or prevent consummation of the Merger and shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub (or,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section 10.06(b) shall be null and void.

(c)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or Merger Sub may assign any or all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without prior written consent to any Financing
Source (provided that any such assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder) pursuant to the terms of the Financing (or any credit
agreements, loan documents or indentures of Parent or Merger Sub or their Affiliates) for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning collateral in
respect of the Financing.

Section 10.07    Governing Law.     This Agreement and all Proceedings (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, or related to this Agreement, the
Transactions, or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would
require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto agrees that any Proceeding of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to any Debt Commitment Letter or Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflict of laws provision thereof that would cause the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

Section 10.08    Jurisdiction.     Each of the parties hereto hereby expressly, irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any Federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any
appellate court from any appeal thereof, in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the Transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees
not to commence any such Proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such Proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such Federal court and
(iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to seek any
post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this Section 10.08 in any such Proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified U.S. mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to Section 10.01. However, nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to
serve process on the other party in any other manner permitted by Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees (i) that any
Proceeding of any kind or nature, whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, against a Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing,
the Preferred Equity Financing or the Transactions, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York,
New York and any appellate court thereof and each party hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts, (ii) not to bring or permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such action or proceeding in any other courts, (iii) that a

Section 10.09    Waiver of Jury Trial.     EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT FINANCING CONTEMPLATED BY
THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER AND THE PREFERRED EQUITY FINANCING CONTEMPLATED BY THE PREFERRED EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTER). EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.09.

Section 10.10    Counterparts; Effectiveness.     This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts (which counterparts may be delivered in original, or by
electronic transmission in .PDF or similar electronic format or by facsimile), each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto
were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
here to. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts
or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF or similar electronic format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Section 10.11    Entire Agreement.     This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and each of the documents, instruments and agreements delivered in connection with
the Transactions, including each of the Exhibits attached hereto and thereto, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, constitute the entire agreement
of the parties and supersede and cancel all prior agreements, undertakings, arrangements, communications and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 10.06(a), are not intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies hereunder.

Section 10.12    Severability.     If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, illegal or incapable
of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in a mutually acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 10.13    No Recourse to Financing Sources.     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
and its and their Representatives that none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Company or any of its or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives relating to this Agreement, any commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or

costs, expenses, fines or penalties to the Company or any of its Affiliates and its or their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.
This Section 10.13 is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Financing Sources and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Company.

(b)   Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties hereto by operation of Law or otherwise without
the prior written consent of the other Parties, except that Parent shall have the right, without the prior written consent of the other Parties, to assign all or any portion of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more of its Subsidiaries. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section 6.9(b) shall be null and void.

Section 6.10    Headings; Interpretation.

(a)   The Parties hereto have participated collectively in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted collectively by the Parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue
of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

(b)   The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "herewith" and words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision
of this Agreement. References to articles, sections, paragraphs and schedules are to the articles, sections and paragraphs of, and schedules to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified, and the headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation." Words describing
the singular number shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa, words denoting any gender shall be deemed to include all genders, words denoting natural persons
shall be deemed to include business entities and vice versa and references to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. The term "or" is not exclusive. The
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The phrases "the date
of this Agreement" and "the date hereof" and terms or phrases of similar import shall be deemed to refer to the date first set forth above, unless the context requires
otherwise. Terms defined in the text of this Agreement have such meaning throughout this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated in this Agreement, and all terms defined in
this Agreement shall have the meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. Any Law
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws (provided that for purposes of any representations and warranties contained in this Agreement that are
made as of a specific date or dates, references to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute, as amended, and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder,
in each case, as of such date). All references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States.

Section 6.11    Governing Law. This Agreement and all Proceedings (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, or related to this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or the actions of Parent or the Stockholders in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would
require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction.

Section 6.12    Specific Performance. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur, and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law, in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction

or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which any Party is entitled at law or in equity. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. The
Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.

Section 6.13    Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties hereto hereby expressly, irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any Federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware,
and any appellate court from any appeal thereof, in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such Proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such Proceeding may be heard and
determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or such Federal court and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such
Proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such Federal court. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law; provided, however, that nothing in the
foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment. Each Party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this Section 6.13 in any such Proceeding by mailing copies thereof by
registered or certified U.S. mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to Section 6.5. However, nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to serve process on any other Party in any other manner permitted by law.

Section 6.14    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 6.14.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Verscend Technologies, Inc. ("Verscend") and its affiliates) of the

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for
the two years ended December 31, 2017; the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the prospectus contained therein dated May 25, 2016 relating to the
Shares; certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders;
certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as
approved for our use by the Company (the "Forecasts"). We have also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment
of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares;
compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded;
reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the healthcare information technology industry and in other industries; and performed such other
studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.

For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax,
accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we
have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of the Company. We have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-
balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that
all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected
benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be

consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our
analysis.

Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any
strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This opinion addresses only the fairness
from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Verscend and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the $44.75 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or
aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including, the fairness of the
Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as
to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, in
connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $44.75 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Verscend and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the
Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or Verscend or the ability of the
Company or Verscend to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in
effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion based on
circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and
assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how
any holder of Shares should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $44.75 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Verscend and its
affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

Board of Directors
Cotiviti Holdings, Inc.
One Glenlake Parkway
Suite 1400
Atlanta, GA 30328

Ladies and Gentlemen:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the
"Shares") of Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. (the Company") (other than (i) holders who have properly exercised dissenters' rights ("Dissenting Shares") and (ii) Verscend
Technologies, Inc. ("Parent"), Rey Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub") or the Company (collectively, "Excluded Shares")) of the $44.75 per
Share in cash (the "Merger Consideration") proposed to be paid to the Stockholders by Parent pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated as of June 17, 2018 (the "Merger Agreement") by and among Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. Pursuant
to the terms of and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Company will be merged into Merger Sub (the "Merger") and each Share will be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon consummation of the Merger.

In connection with our review of the proposed Merger and the preparation of our opinion herein, we have examined: (a) the Merger Agreement; (b) certain audited historical
financial statements of the Company for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2017; (c) the unaudited financial statements of the Company for the three months ended
March 31, 2018 and 2017; (d) certain internal business, operating and financial information and forecasts of the Company for the fiscal years December 31, 2018 through
December 31, 2022 (the "Forecasts"), prepared by the senior management of the Company; (e) information regarding publicly available financial terms of certain other
business combinations we deemed relevant; (f) the financial position and operating results of the Company compared with those of certain other publicly traded companies
we deemed relevant; (g) current and historical market prices and trading volumes of the Shares; and (h) certain other publicly available information on the Company. We have
also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company to discuss the foregoing, have considered other matters which we have deemed relevant to
our inquiry and have taken into account such accepted financial and investment banking procedures and considerations as we have deemed relevant.

In rendering our opinion, we have assumed and relied, without independent verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of all the information examined by or otherwise
reviewed or discussed with us for purposes of this opinion, including without limitation the Forecasts provided by senior management. We have not made or obtained an
independent valuation or appraisal of the assets, liabilities or solvency of the Company. We have been advised by the senior management of the Company that the Forecasts
examined by us have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the senior management of the Company. In that
regard, we have assumed, with your consent, that, (i) the Forecasts will be achieved in the amounts and at the times contemplated thereby and (ii) all material assets and
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company are as set forth in the Company's financial statements or other information made available to us. We express no opinion
with respect to the Forecasts or the estimates and judgments on which they are based. We did not consider and express no opinion as to the amount or nature of the
compensation to any of the Company's

officers, directors or employees (or any class of such persons) relative to the compensation to other Stockholders. We were not asked to consider, and our opinion does not
address, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies that might exist for the Company or the effect of any other transaction in which
the Company might engage. Our opinion herein is based upon economic, market, financial and other conditions existing on, and other information disclosed to us as of, the
date of this letter. It should be understood that, although subsequent developments may affect this opinion, we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this
opinion. We have relied as to legal matters related to the Merger on advice of counsel to the Company, and have assumed that the Merger will be consummated on the terms
described in the Merger Agreement, without any waiver of any material terms or conditions by the Company.

William Blair & Company has been engaged in the investment banking business since 1935. We continually undertake the valuation of investment securities in connection
with public offerings, private placements, business combinations, estate and gift tax valuations and similar transactions. In the ordinary course of our business, we may from
time to time trade the securities of the Company for our own account and for the accounts of customers, and accordingly may at any time hold a long or short position in such
securities. We are familiar with the Company, having provided certain investment banking services to the Company from time to time, including serving as a co-manager for a
public offering of 10,000,000 Shares in August 2017 and a book-running manager for a public offering of 9,683,000 Shares in March 2017, for which we received aggregate
underwriting fees of approximately $1.3 million from the Company. We have acted as an investment banker to the Company in connection with the Merger and will receive a
fee from the Company for our services, a significant portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us
against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.

We are expressing no opinion herein as to the price at which the Shares will trade at any future time or as to the effect of the announcement of the Merger on the trading price
of the Shares.

Our investment banking services and our opinion were provided for the use and benefit of the Strategy Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and, at its
direction, the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Our opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Stockholders (other than Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares) of the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, and
we do not address the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger and this opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any Stockholder
as to how such Stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger. It is understood that this letter may not be disclosed or otherwise referred to without prior written
consent, except that the opinion may be included in its entirety in a proxy statement mailed to the Stockholders by the Company with respect to the Merger. This opinion has
been reviewed and approved by our Fairness Opinion Committee.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as investment bankers that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to
the Stockholders (other than Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares).

Appendix D 

Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law 

(a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to
such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section
and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word
"stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words
"depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a
corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

(b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251
(other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258,
§ 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of
the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record
by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a
merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a
constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257,
258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect
thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of
record by more than 2,000 holders;

c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in

(3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the
parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as
contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly
as practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent
corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting corporation."

(c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as
a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e),
and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders,
the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or
such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to
subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice
a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for
appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such
a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of
such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this
subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the
effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or
series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are
available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of
the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within
20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the
offer contemplated by § 251(h) of

this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares.
Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent
corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of
such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation
shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more
than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the
consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to
each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of
the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the
absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each
constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is
given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given
prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a)
and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding
a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such
stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the
corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation
and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the
stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration
of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who
is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request
from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after
such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have
demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition
shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a

duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified
mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court
deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting
corporation.

(g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The
Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which
appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled
to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of
the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of
this title.

(h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except
as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at
5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date
of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value
of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any
stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the
stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section
and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled
thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by
certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery
may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a
stockholder, the Court may order all or a

portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and
expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be
entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to
stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within
the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's
demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in
subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or
consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
