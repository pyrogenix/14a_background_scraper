CALLIDUS SOFTWARE INC.
4140 Dublin Boulevard, Suite 400

Dublin, California 94568
February 22, 2018

Dear Stockholder:

       You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders of Callidus Software Inc. ("Callidus" or "we," "us," or "our") to be held on March 29, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific
Time, at our headquarters located at 4140 Dublin Boulevard, Suite 400, Dublin, California 94568.

       At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt an agreement and plan of merger ("Merger Agreement") by and among SAP America, Inc.
("SAP"), Emerson One Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAP, and Callidus.

       If the Merger Agreement is adopted and the merger is completed, Callidus will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAP and each share of Callidus common stock that you own as of the
date of the merger will be converted into the right to receive $36.00 in cash, without interest and less any withholding taxes required by applicable law (unless you have properly demanded
your statutory rights of appraisal with respect to the merger).

       Our board of directors ("Board") considered a number of factors in evaluating the terms of the Merger Agreement. Based on its review, our Board unanimously determined that the terms
and conditions of the merger and the Merger Agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Callidus and our stockholders. Accordingly, our Board has unanimously approved
the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the adoption of the
Merger Agreement.

       The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the special meeting, the Merger Agreement and the merger. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to
the proxy statement. We encourage you to read the proxy statement carefully in its entirety. The proxy statement is dated February 22, 2018, and is first being mailed to Callidus stockholders
on or about February 26, 2018.

       Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own.    The proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement must be approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of
Callidus common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Only stockholders who owned shares of Callidus common stock at the close of business on February 15, 2018, the record date
for the special meeting, will be entitled to vote at the special meeting.

       To vote your shares, you may return your proxy card, submit a proxy via the Internet or by telephone, as specified in the Internet and telephone voting instructions contained in the proxy
statement, or attend the special meeting and vote in person. If your shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, you must instruct the brokerage firm, bank,
trust or other nominee how to vote your shares or obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from that record holder in order to vote at the special meeting. Even if you plan to attend the special
meeting, we urge you to promptly submit a proxy for your shares via the Internet or by telephone or by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card.

       If you fail to return your proxy, attend the special meeting and vote in person, or give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, then your shares
will not be counted for determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and your decision not to respond will have the same effect as if you voted "AGAINST" the
adoption of the Merger Agreement.

       If you attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you may revoke your proxy and vote in person.

       Thank you for your continued support of Callidus.

Dublin, California
February 22, 2018

  Sincerely,

  

  
ROXANNE OULMAN
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

CALLIDUS SOFTWARE INC.

Dublin, California 94568

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS AND PROXY STATEMENT

To the Stockholders of Callidus Software Inc.:

       Callidus Software Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Callidus" or "we," "us," or "our"), will hold a special meeting of stockholders at our headquarters located at 4140 Dublin Boulevard,
Suite 400, Dublin, California 94568, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Time, on March 29, 2018, to consider and vote upon the following proposals:

1. To adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 29, 2018, by and among SAP America, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("SAP"), Emerson One Acquisition Corp.,
a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of SAP ("Merger Sub"), and Callidus, as such agreement may be amended from time to time ("Merger Agreement"); 

2. To approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Callidus's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates
to the merger ("compensation proposal"); and 

3. To approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date, if our board of directors ("Board") determines that it is necessary or appropriate and is permitted by the
Merger Agreement, to solicit additional proxies if there is not a quorum present or there are not sufficient votes in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the time of
the special meeting ("adjournment proposal").

       Only record holders of Callidus common stock at the close of business on February 15, 2018, are entitled to receive notice of, and will be entitled to vote at, the special meeting, including
any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of Callidus common stock you own.

       The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Callidus common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the Merger Agreement is required to adopt the Merger
Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Callidus common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the
compensation proposal at the special meeting is required to approve the compensation proposal, and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Callidus
common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the adjournment proposal at the special meeting is required to approve the adjournment proposal.

       In the event that a quorum is not present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, it is expected that the Board will recommend adjournment of the special meeting to
solicit additional proxies if permitted by the Merger Agreement. If there is not a quorum of stockholders at the special meeting and the vote with respect to the adjournment proposal fails, our
Board, if permitted by the Merger Agreement, may set a new record date and meeting date for a special meeting to consider the Merger Agreement, compensation proposal and adjournment
proposal.

       If the merger is completed, Callidus stockholders who (i) submit a written demand for an appraisal of their shares prior to the stockholder vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement,
(ii) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consent thereto in writing, (iii) take certain actions and meet certain conditions under Delaware law and (iv) do not
thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of their shares of Callidus common stock or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with Delaware law, will have the
right to have such shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment of the fair value of such shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, as

that if your shares are held in the name of your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee and you wish to vote at the special meeting, you must instruct the brokerage firm, bank, trust or
other nominee how to vote your shares or obtain a proxy issued in your name from that record holder.

       If you sign, date and return your proxy card or submit a proxy via the Internet or by telephone without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted "FOR" the adoption of the
Merger Agreement, "FOR" the compensation proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal. If you do attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you may revoke your proxy and
vote in person. You may revoke your proxy in the manner described in the enclosed proxy statement at any time before it has been voted at the special meeting.

       Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" adoption of the Merger Agreement, "FOR" the advisory compensation proposal and "FOR" the adjournment
proposal.

       The merger is described in the accompanying proxy statement, which we urge you to read carefully. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER

       The following Q&A is intended to address some commonly asked questions about the special meeting of stockholders and the merger. These questions and answers may not address all
questions that may be important to you as a Callidus stockholder. We urge you to read carefully the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this
proxy statement and the documents we refer to in this proxy statement.

       Except as otherwise specifically noted in this proxy statement, "we," "our," "us" and similar words in this proxy statement refer to Callidus Software Inc. In addition, throughout this proxy
statement, we refer to Callidus Software Inc., as "Callidus," to Emerson One Acquisition Corp. as "Merger Sub," to SAP America, Inc. as "SAP," and to SAP SE as "SAP SE."

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement? 

A: You are receiving this proxy statement because you were a Callidus stockholder as of February 15, 2018, the record date for the special meeting. To complete the merger, Callidus's
stockholders holding a majority of the shares of Callidus common stock outstanding as of February 15, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, must vote to adopt the Merger
Agreement. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.

The Merger 

Q: What will happen to my Callidus common stock as a result of the merger? 

A: If the merger is completed, each share of Callidus common stock that you hold at the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive $36.00 in cash, without
interest, less any withholding taxes required by applicable law. This does not apply to shares of Callidus common stock held by any Callidus stockholders who have properly demanded
their appraisal rights under Delaware law (as more fully described below under the heading "The Merger — Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 53 of this proxy statement). 

Q: What will happen to Callidus generally as a result of the merger? 

A: If the merger is completed, Callidus will cease to be an independent public company and will be a company wholly-owned by SAP. As a result, you will no longer have any ownership
interest in Callidus. Upon completion of the merger, shares of Callidus common stock will no longer be listed on any stock exchange or quotation system, including The Nasdaq Stock
Market. In addition, following the completion of the merger, the registration of Callidus common stock and our reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended ("Exchange Act"), will be terminated. 

Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to me? 

A: The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Callidus common stock pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, you
will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash you receive and the adjusted tax basis of your shares of Callidus common stock. If you are a U.S. holder,
you generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the merger. If you are a non-U.S. holder, you generally will not be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on any gain recognized in connection with the merger unless you have certain connections to the United States. The tax consequences of the merger to you will
depend on your particular circumstances, and you should consult your own tax advisors to determine how the merger will affect you. For a more detailed summary of the U.S. federal
income tax

consequences of the merger, see "The Merger — Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 57 of this proxy statement.

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger? 

A: Statutory appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger will be available to stockholders who (i) submit a written demand for an appraisal of their shares prior to
the stockholder vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consent thereto in writing, (iii) take certain actions
and meet certain conditions under Delaware law and (iv) do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of their shares of Callidus common stock or otherwise lose their
appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with Delaware law. For a more detailed discussion of your appraisal rights, see the section entitled "The Merger — Appraisal Rights"
beginning on page 53 of this proxy statement. 

A copy of the full text of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") is included as Annex C to this proxy statement. Failure to precisely follow any of the
statutory procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed? 

A: We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible; however, the merger is subject to various closing conditions, including Callidus stockholder approval, the
expiration or earlier termination of the required waiting period under the HSR Act and obtaining applicable foreign antitrust approvals. We cannot assure you that all conditions to the
merger will be satisfied or, if satisfied, the date by which they will be satisfied.

The Special Meeting 

Q: When and where will the special meeting of stockholders be held? 

A: The special meeting of Callidus stockholders will be held at our headquarters located at 4140 Dublin Boulevard, Suite 400, Dublin, California 94568, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Time, on
March 29, 2018. 

Q: What are the proposals that will be voted on at the special meeting? 

A: You will be asked to consider and vote on (i) a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (ii) a proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid
or become payable to our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger ("compensation proposal"); and (iii) a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a
later date or time, if our Board determines that it is necessary or appropriate and is permitted by the Merger Agreement, including to solicit additional proxies if there is not a quorum
present or there are not sufficient votes in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting ("adjournment proposal"). 

Q: How does our Board recommend that I vote on the proposals? 

A: Our Board unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and determined that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable, fair to and in
the best interests of Callidus and our stockholders and unanimously recommends that you vote: 

• "FOR" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; 

• "FOR" the advisory compensation proposal; and

Table of Contents

• "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

You should read the section entitled "The Merger — Recommendation of Callidus Board and Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 34 of this proxy statement.

Q: Who is entitled to attend and vote at the special meeting? 

A: The record date for the special meeting is February 15, 2018. If you own shares of Callidus common stock as of the close of business on the record date, you are entitled to notice of,
and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournment of the special meeting. As of the record date, there were approximately 66,460,419 shares of Callidus common stock issued and
outstanding held collectively by approximately 19 stockholders of record. 

Q: How many votes are required to adopt the Merger Agreement? 

A: Under Delaware law, adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative approval of the holders of a majority of the shares of Callidus common stock outstanding and entitled
to vote on the Merger Agreement. 

Q: How many votes are required to approve the compensation proposal? 

A: In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), stockholders have the opportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to compensation
that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers based upon or otherwise relating to the merger, as reported in the "Golden Parachute Compensation" table on
page 51 of this proxy statement. The vote to approve the compensation proposal is advisory and therefore will not be binding on Callidus or SAP, nor will it overrule any prior decision
or require the Callidus Board (or any committee of the Board) to take any action, regardless of whether the merger is completed. The compensation that may be paid in connection with
the proposed merger is contractual with respect to Callidus's named executive officers. Accordingly, if Callidus's stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and the merger is
completed, the compensation based on or otherwise relating to the merger will be paid to Callidus's named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their compensation
agreements and arrangements, regardless of whether Callidus's stockholders approve the compensation proposal. 

Callidus's Board will consider the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Callidus common stock that are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote on the compensation proposal at the special meeting as advisory approval of the compensation proposal.

Q: How many votes are required to adopt the adjournment proposal? 

A: Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Callidus common stock that are present in person or represented by
proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal at the special meeting (even if less than a quorum). 

Q: How are votes counted? Why is my vote important? What happens if I abstain? 

A: If you do not submit a proxy or voting instructions or vote in person at the special meeting, it will be more difficult for us to obtain the necessary quorum to hold the special meeting. 

Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the special meeting, who will separately count "FOR" and "AGAINST" votes and abstentions.

If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, or fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have the same
effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

If you abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against the advisory compensation proposal and adjournment proposal.

If you fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, or fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have no effect on the advisory
compensation proposal or adjournment proposal.

Q: Do any Callidus directors or executive officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Callidus stockholders? 

A: In considering the recommendation of our Board with respect to the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that
may be different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our Board was aware that these interests existed
and considered them, among other matters, when it approved the Merger Agreement and made its recommendation that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. You should read
the section entitled "The Merger — Interests of Callidus Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 47 of this proxy statement. 

Q: What do I need to do now? 

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, including the annexes and the other documents referred to in this proxy statement, please vote
your shares in one of the manners described below. You have one vote for each share of Callidus common stock you own as of the record date. 

Q: How do I vote if I am a stockholder of record? 

A: You may vote: 

• by following the Internet voting instructions printed on your proxy card; 

• by following the telephone voting instructions printed on your proxy card; 

• by completing, signing and dating each proxy card you receive and returning it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope; or 

• by appearing and casting your vote in person at the special meeting.

If you are voting via the Internet or by telephone, your voting instructions must be received by the date and time indicated on the applicable proxy card(s).

Voting via the Internet, by telephone or by mailing in your proxy card will not prevent you from voting in person at the special meeting. You are encouraged to submit a proxy via the
Internet, by telephone or by mail even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, to ensure that your shares of Callidus common stock are present in person or represented at
the special meeting.

If your shares are held by a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, you may direct your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee to submit a proxy card by following the
instructions that

the brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee provides to you with these materials. If you hold shares through a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee and wish to vote your
shares in person at the special meeting, you must instruct the brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote your shares or obtain a proxy from your brokerage firm, bank,
trust or other nominee and present it to the inspector of elections with your ballot when you vote at the special meeting.

If you return a properly signed and dated proxy card but do not mark the box showing how you wish to vote, your shares will be voted "FOR" the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, "FOR" the compensation proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal. Please do not send your stock certificate with your proxy card.

Q: How do I vote if my shares are held by my brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee? 

A: If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee, such as a bank or trust, then the brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee is considered to be the stockholder
of record with respect to those shares. However, you still are considered to be the beneficial owner of those shares, with your shares being held in "street name." "Street name" holders
generally cannot vote their shares directly and must instead instruct the brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote their shares. Your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other
nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares for you at the special meeting if you instruct it how to vote. Therefore, it is important that you promptly follow the directions
provided by your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee regarding how to instruct them to vote your shares. If you wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you must bring a
proxy from your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee authorizing you to vote at the special meeting. 

In addition, because any shares you may hold in "street name" will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares you hold of record, shares held in "street name" will
not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. To be sure your shares are voted, you should instruct your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee to vote
your shares that you hold in "street name." Shares held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity.

Q: May I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy? 

A: Yes. If you are the stockholder of record of Callidus common stock, you have the right to change or revoke your proxy at any time before the vote being taken at the special meeting: 

• by delivering to our General Counsel a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of the proxy, stating that the proxy is revoked; 

• by attending the special meeting and voting in person (your attendance at the meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy, so you must vote in person at the meeting to
revoke your proxy); 

• by signing and delivering a new proxy, relating to the same shares of Callidus common stock and bearing a later date; or 

• by submitting another proxy by telephone or via the Internet after the date of your prior proxy and by the date and time indicated on the applicable proxy card(s).

Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of any proxies should be addressed to:

Callidus Software Inc.
4140 Dublin Boulevard, Suite 400

Dublin, California 94568
Attn: General Counsel

If you are a "street name" holder of Callidus common stock, you should contact your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee to obtain instructions as to how to change or revoke
your proxy.

Q: What is the deadline for voting my shares? 

A: If you are a stockholder of record, your proxy must be received via the Internet or by telephone by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on March 28, 2018, in order for your shares to be voted at
the special meeting. However, if you are a stockholder of record, you may instead mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card, which must be received before the polls close at
the special meeting, in order for your shares to be voted at the special meeting. If you are a beneficial owner, please read the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker, trust or
other nominee for information on the deadline for voting your shares. 

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now? 

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will be sent a letter of transmittal with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of Callidus common stock for the merger
consideration. If your shares are held in "street name" by your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other
nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your "street name" shares in exchange for the merger consideration. PLEASE DO NOT SEND IN YOUR CERTIFICATES NOW. 

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of Callidus common stock after the record date but before the special meeting? 

A: The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the expected closing date of the merger. If you transfer your
shares of Callidus common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the special meeting but
will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares. 

In addition, if you sell your shares prior to the special meeting or prior to the effective time of the merger, you will not be eligible to exercise your appraisal rights in respect of the
merger. For a more detailed discussion of your appraisal rights and the requirements for properly demanding your appraisal rights, see "The Merger — Appraisal Rights" beginning on
page 53 of this proxy statement and Annex C to this proxy statement.

Q: What happens if the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is not approved by our stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason? 

A: If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is not approved by our stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any payment
for their shares in connection with the merger. Instead, we will remain a stand-alone public company and Callidus common stock will continue to be listed and traded on The Nasdaq
Stock Market. Under specified

circumstances, we may be required to pay to SAP a termination fee, as described below under "The Merger Agreement — Termination Fee and Expenses" beginning on page 87 of this
proxy statement.

Q: How do our directors and executive officers intend to vote their shares of common stock in respect of the merger proposal? 

A: We currently expect that our directors and executive officers will vote their shares of common stock in favor of the merger proposal. At the close of business on the record date for the
special meeting, directors and executive officers of Callidus and their affiliates were entitled to vote 601,659 shares of common stock at the special meeting, or approximately 0.91% of
the shares of common stock outstanding on such date. 

Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 

A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the
"stockholder of record." If you are a stockholder of record, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on behalf of Callidus. 

If your shares are held through a brokerage firm, bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares of common stock held in "street name." If you are
a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in "street name," this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with
respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your brokerage firm, bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares
by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in
person by ballot at the special meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from your brokerage firm, bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special
meeting.

Q: What happens if I return my proxy card but I do not indicate how to vote? 

A: If you properly return your proxy card but do not include instructions on how to vote, your shares of common stock will be voted "FOR" the approval of the merger proposal, "FOR"
the approval of the compensation proposal and "FOR" the approval of the adjournment proposal. We do not currently intend to present any other proposals for consideration at the
special meeting. 

Q: Do I need to attend the special meeting? 

A: No. While our stockholders of record may exercise their right to vote their shares in person at the special meeting, it is not necessary for you to attend the special meeting in order to
vote your shares of common stock. 

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials? 

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards, if your shares are
registered differently or are held in more than one account. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction form
for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy
card. Please sign, date and return (or grant your

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?

to be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Callidus files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned "Where You Can Find More Information."

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

       This proxy statement contains "forward-looking statements," as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended ("Exchange Act"), that are based on our current expectations, assumptions, beliefs, estimates and projections about the proposed merger, Callidus and our industry. The forward-
looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Generally, these
forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "intend," "plan," "project," "should,"
"could" and similar expressions. Factors that may affect those forward-looking statements include, among other things:

• the parties' inability to consummate the merger due to failure to satisfy conditions to the completion of the transaction, including the receipt of stockholder approval or
the regulatory approvals required for the transaction, which may not be obtained on the terms expected, on the anticipated schedule or at all; 

• the failure to recruit or retain Callidus employees; 

• the intense competition facing SAP and Callidus, which may pose unexpected future challenges; 

• the risk that the Merger Agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay SAP a termination fee of $75 million in connection therewith; 

• the costs, fees, expenses and charges we incur related to the merger; 

• risks arising from the merger's diversion of management's attention from our ongoing business operations; 

• the outcome of lawsuits that have been or may be brought by certain purported stockholders seeking to rescind the Merger Agreement or enjoin the consummation of the
merger; 

• the effect of the announcement or pendency of the merger on our business relationships, operating results and business generally; 

• adverse effects on the market price of our common stock and on our operating results because of a failure to complete the merger; 

• the risk that our financial results differ from those set forth in the projections described in this proxy statement; and 

• other risks detailed in Callidus's filings with the SEC, including Callidus's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which
discuss these and other important risk factors concerning our operations.

       We caution you that reliance on any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and that, although we believe that the assumptions on which our forward-looking
statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions could be incorrect. In
light of these and other uncertainties, you should not conclude that we will achieve any plans and objectives or projected financial results referred to in any of the forward-looking statements.
We do not undertake to revise any of these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.

Special Meeting of Callidus's Stockholders (page 22)

       Date, Time and Place.    A special meeting of our stockholders will be held on March 29, 2018, at our headquarters located at 4140 Dublin Boulevard, Suite 400, Dublin, California 94568,
at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Time, to consider and vote upon:

• a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; 

• a proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Callidus's named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the merger ("compensation proposal"); and 

• a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if our Board determines that it is necessary or appropriate and is permitted by the Merger Agreement, to solicit
additional proxies if there is not a quorum present or there are not sufficient votes in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting
("adjournment proposal").

       Record Date and Voting Power.    You are entitled to vote at the special meeting if you owned shares of our common stock at the close of business on February 15, 2018, the record date for
the special meeting. You will have one vote at the special meeting for each share of our common stock you owned at the close of business on the record date. There are 66,460,419 shares of
our common stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the special meeting.

       Quorum.    A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid special meeting. Under our bylaws, a quorum is present at the special meeting if the holders of a majority of the shares of
our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders are represented in person or by proxy.

       Vote Required.    The adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the
Merger Agreement.

       Approval of the non-binding, advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock present in person or

       Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy
and entitled to vote on the adjournment proposal at the special meeting (even if less than a quorum).

solicit additional proxies if

permitted by the Merger Agreement. If there is not a quorum of stockholders at the special meeting and the vote with respect to the adjournment proposal fails, then our Board, if permitted by
the Merger Agreement, may set a new record date and meeting date for a special meeting to consider the Merger Agreement, compensation proposal and adjournment proposal.

Treatment of Outstanding Common Stock (page 63)

       The Merger Agreement provides that each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted at the effective time of the
merger into the right to receive $36.00 in cash, without interest and less any withholding taxes required by applicable law.

       After the merger is completed, as a result of the merger, you will have the right to receive the merger consideration but you will no longer have any rights as a Callidus stockholder. Each
Callidus stockholder will receive the merger consideration in exchange for the shares of Callidus common stock in accordance with the instructions contained in the letter of transmittal to be
sent to Callidus stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the closing of the merger, unless the Callidus stockholder has properly demanded appraisal of its shares and not withdrawn
the demand.

Treatment of Outstanding Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (page 63)

       Stock Options.    Each stock option (whether vested or unvested) that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding at the effective time of the merger, without any further action of the parties
or the optionholder, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares subject to such stock option and
(ii) the excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration of $36.00 over the applicable per share exercise price of such stock option (without interest and less any withholding taxes required
by applicable law).

       Vested RSUs and PSUs.    Each time-based restricted stock unit ("RSU") or performance-based restricted stock unit ("PSU") that is vested (but not released or otherwise settled) at the
effective time of the merger will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive the per share merger consideration of $36.00 for each share of our common stock underlying such RSU or
PSU (without interest and less any withholding taxes required by applicable law).

       Unvested RSUs.    Each RSU granted prior to January 29, 2018 (other than RSUs held by our non-employee directors), that remains outstanding immediately prior to, and is not vested
immediately prior to, the effective time of the merger will be cancelled in exchange for the unvested right to receive in cash the per share merger consideration of $36.00 for each share of our
common stock underlying such RSU (without interest and less any withholding taxes required by applicable law), with such right to vest and become payable on the date upon which each such
corresponding RSU would have vested under the time-based vesting terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreement or change of control agreement governing such RSU. If
such terms and conditions are not satisfied and such right does not otherwise vest pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement or change of control agreement, no cash payment
will be made with respect to such RSU.

       Unvested 2018 RSUs.    Each RSU granted on or after January 29, 2018, the Merger Agreement date (the "2018 RSUs") will be converted into a cash-settled restricted stock unit
denominated in shares of SAP SE, pursuant to an exchange ratio determined based on SAP SE's average trading price over the five days immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
and will remain subject to the time and service-based vesting terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreement governing such 2018 RSU. Upon a given vesting date, the
payment amount for the portion of each such 2018 RSU that vests will be determined based on SAP SE's average trading price over the five days immediately prior to the date upon

which such portion would have vested under the time-based vesting terms and conditions set forth in the award agreement governing such 2018 RSU. Each such cash payment will be paid in
the next practical payroll date after the applicable vesting date set forth in the award agreement governing the 2018 RSU, but not later than the month following such vesting date.

       Unvested PSUs.    Each PSU that remains outstanding immediately prior to, and is not vested immediately prior to, the effective time of the merger will be (i) deemed earned and credited
for performance, as described in the section entitled "The Merger — Interests of Callidus Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Interests of Executive Officers" beginning on
page 48 of this proxy statement, with respect to any uncompleted performance period as of the date of the Merger Agreement and (ii) cancelled in exchange for the unvested right to receive in
cash the per share merger consideration of $36.00 for each share of our common stock underlying such PSU (after giving effect to the foregoing crediting of performance metrics), without
interest and less any withholding taxes required by applicable law, with such payment to vest and become payable on the date upon which each such PSU would have vested under the time-
based vesting terms and conditions applicable to such PSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. The pay-out levels set forth in the Merger Agreement (which were determined
based on actual performance levels through 2017, except that uncompleted performance periods for PSUs granted in 2017 will be deemed to be earned at 100% of target, resulting in assumed
92% achievement for the full performance cycle). If such terms and conditions are not satisfied and such right does not otherwise vest pursuant to the terms of the applicable change of control
agreement, no cash payment will be made with respect to such PSU.

       Unvested RSUs Held by Non-Employee Directors.    Each RSU held by our non-employee directors that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, whether
vested or unvested, will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the per share merger consideration of $36.00 for each share of our common stock underlying such RSU (without
interest), to be paid in cash in a single lump sum payment as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 30 days) following the effective time of the merger.

Treatment of Purchase Rights under Employee Stock Purchase Plan (page 64)

       Each current offering period in progress as of the date of the Merger Agreement under our Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") will continue after the date of
the Merger Agreement and shares will be issued to participants thereunder on the next currently scheduled purchase dates that occur after the effective date of the Merger Agreement (subject
to the terms and conditions of the ESPP). However, any offering period in progress as of the effective time of the merger will be shortened such that the last day of each such offering period
will be two business days before the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs and each then outstanding purchase right under the ESPP will be exercised automatically at such
time. No new offering period will commence under the ESPP at or after the date of the Merger Agreement, except following a valid termination of the Merger Agreement. Each purchased
share under the ESPP will be converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive in cash the per share merger consideration of $36.00, without interest and less any
withholding taxes required by applicable law. As of, or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, we will terminate the ESPP.

Recommendation of Callidus's Board and Reasons for the Merger (page 34)

       At a meeting of our Board on January 29, 2018, our Board unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the merger are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Callidus
and its stockholders and unanimously approved the Merger Agreement. Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the adoption of the Merger Agreement, "FOR" the
compensation proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

Table of Contents

       In the course of reaching its decision, our Board consulted with our senior management, reviewed a significant amount of information and considered a number of factors. For a discussion
of the factors considered by our Board in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and recommend that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, see "The Merger —
Recommendation of Callidus's Board and Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 34 of this proxy statement.

Opinion of Callidus's Financial Advisor (page 39 and Annex B)

       We retained Qatalyst Partners LP ("Qatalyst Partners") to act as our financial advisor in connection with the merger. We selected Qatalyst Partners to act as our financial advisor based on
Qatalyst Partners' qualifications, expertise, reputation, its knowledge of our business and affairs and the industry in which we operate and its close familiarity with the Board, our business and
management team, as well as Qatalyst Partners' prior experience representing other companies in transactions with SAP. Qatalyst Partners delivered its written opinion, dated as of January 29,
2018, that as of such date and based upon and subject to the considerations, limitations, qualifications, assumptions and other matters set forth therein, the $36.00 per share cash consideration
to be received by the holders of Callidus common stock, other than SAP or any affiliates of SAP, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders.

       The full text of the written opinion of Qatalyst Partners, dated as of January 29, 2018, is attached as Annex B and is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement in its entirety. See
also "The Merger — Opinion of Callidus's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 39 of this proxy statement. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion. You should read the opinion carefully in its entirety.
Qatalyst Partners' opinion was provided to our Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness from a financial point of view of the $36.00 per share cash consideration to
be received by the holders of Callidus common stock, other than SAP or any affiliates of SAP, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement, and it does not address
any other aspect of the merger. It does not constitute a recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter and does not in any manner
address the price at which our common stock will trade at any time. For a further discussion of Qatalyst Partners' opinion, see "The Merger — Opinion of Callidus's Financial Advisor"
beginning on page 39 of this proxy statement.

Interests of Callidus Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 47)

       When considering the recommendation of our Board, you should be aware that members of our Board and our executive officers have interests in the merger in addition to their interests as
Callidus stockholders generally, as described below. These interests may be different from, or in conflict with, your interests as a Callidus stockholder, including interests arising from the
following:

• the Merger Agreement provides for cash merger consideration with respect to all stock options; 

• each of our non-employee directors is entitled to full acceleration of any unvested restricted stock units pursuant to the terms of his or her respective change of control
agreement; 

• letter agreements between Callidus and certain of our executive officers executed in connection with the Merger Agreement clarify how performance goals will be
measured at the effective time of the merger for purposes of determining pay-out levels; 

• certain of our executive officers are party to agreements with us that provide for cash severance and other benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations of
employment, including the

acceleration of all unvested equity awards, in connection with a qualifying termination within 18 months of the merger; and

• our directors and officers are entitled to continued indemnification and liability insurance following completion of the merger.

       The members of our Board were aware of the material facts as to these additional interests, and considered them, among other things, when they approved the Merger Agreement. For a
discussion of the interests of Callidus directors and executive officers in the merger, see "The Merger — Interests of Callidus Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on
page 47 of this proxy statement.

Conditions to the Closing of the Merger (page 83)

       As more fully described in this proxy statement and in the Merger Agreement, the completion of the merger depends on a number of conditions being satisfied or waived (where legally
possible). Our, SAP's and Merger Sub's obligations to effect the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver at or prior to the effective time of the merger of each of the following conditions
(among others):

• the adoption of the Merger Agreement by an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock; 

• the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act; 

• the receipt of approval under certain other antitrust laws or the expiration of any mandatory waiting period related thereto; and 

• the absence of any order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) of a court of competent jurisdiction or any other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction
restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the merger and the absence of any law that prevents the consummation of the merger.

       SAP's and Merger Sub's obligations to effect the merger are further subject to the satisfaction or waiver by SAP or Merger Sub at or prior to the effective time of the merger of the
following conditions (among others):

• the continued accuracy (subject to an enumerated dollar threshold) of certain of our representations and warranties related to our capitalization; 

• the continued accuracy in all material respects of certain "fundamental representations"; 

• the continued accuracy of our representations and warranties other than those certain above-referenced representations and warranties, except as would not have a
material adverse effect on us; 

• our performance in all material respects of all obligations and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement to be performed or complied with by us prior to or on the
closing date; and 

• that a material adverse effect has not occurred and is not continuing.

       Our obligations to effect the merger are further subject to the satisfaction or waiver by us at or prior to the effective time of the merger of the following conditions:

• the continued accuracy of the representations and warranties of SAP and Merger Sub, except for such failures as would not prevent the closing of the merger; and

Table of Contents

• SAP's and Merger Sub's performance in all material respects of all obligations and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement to be performed or complied with by
them prior to or on the closing date.

No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals (page 76)

       The Merger Agreement restricts our ability to initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or induce an acquisition proposal with respect to Callidus, or engage in discussions or negotiations with
a third party regarding specified transactions involving Callidus. Notwithstanding these restrictions, prior to the time that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, our Board may
respond to a bona fide written acquisition proposal that our Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, an acquisition proposal superior to the merger with SAP (as described under "The Merger Agreement — Covenants — No
Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals" beginning on page 76) and with respect to which our Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that failure to take action would be inconsistent with the Board's fiduciary duties, by furnishing information with respect to Callidus and by
entering into discussions with the party or parties making the acquisition proposal, so long as we comply with the terms of the Merger Agreement.

       In addition, prior to the time our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, our Board may withdraw its recommendation of the Merger Agreement in connection with a superior proposal
if it concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that in light of such superior proposal, the failure to
change its recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to our stockholders, so long as we comply with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Our Board may also withdraw
its recommendation of the Merger Agreement prior to the time our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances unrelated to an acquisition proposal if it concludes in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that in light of an intervening event, the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to our stockholders, so long as we comply with the terms of the Merger Agreement.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 85)

       The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances by both SAP and Callidus jointly and under other circumstances by either SAP or Callidus alone. The Merger
Agreement may be terminated prior to the effective time under the following circumstances:

       by mutual written consent of Callidus and SAP;

       by either SAP or Callidus if:

• the effective time of the merger has not occurred on or before the "Outside Date," which means July 30, 2018, except that the date may be extended for up to three
months if all conditions to the consummation of the merger have been satisfied or waived, other than (i) the termination or expiration of any waiting period under the
HSR Act, (ii) receipt of other antitrust or competition law approvals required under the Merger Agreement, (iii) existence of an order under any antitrust law prohibiting
the closing of the merger, or (iv) existence of a pending action by a governmental entity that asserts, or the enactment or enforcement of a law that would result in, the
illegality of, or placement of certain prohibitions or limitations on, the consummation of the merger or the ownership of Callidus by SAP;

• a court or governmental entity has issued a final order or taken a final action to permanently prohibit the merger; or 

• we fail to obtain stockholder approval of the merger;

       by Callidus if:

• at any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, our Board determines to accept a superior proposal, and we are permitted to accept such
superior proposal pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, provided that we concurrently pay the termination fee to SAP as described below under the heading
"— Termination Fee and Expenses;" or 

• an SAP representation or warranty is breached or SAP fails to perform a covenant contained in the Merger Agreement that would prevent closing of the merger and such
breach or failure has not been or cannot be remedied within the specified cure period in the Merger Agreement;

       by SAP if:

• our Board changes its recommendation with respect to adoption of the Merger Agreement or approves or recommends any acquisition proposal; 

• we fail to issue a press release that expressly reaffirms our Board recommendation within five business days after our receipt of a written request by SAP to provide such
reaffirmation following a third party's acquisition proposal or declaration of its intent to issue an acquisition proposal, provided that SAP will be permitted only one such
reaffirmation request per acquisition proposal; 

• a tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes an acquisition proposal is commenced, and our Board does not recommend that our stockholders reject the tender offer
or exchange offer within a specified timeframe; 

• we breach the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement in any material respect; 

• we fail to include in this proxy statement our Board's recommendation for our stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement; 

• we or our Board (or any committee thereof) resolves, authorizes or publicly proposes to do any of the actions specified above; 

• a Callidus representation or warranty is breached or Callidus fails to perform a covenant contained in the Merger Agreement so that the related closing conditions would
not be satisfied and such breach or failure has not been or cannot be remedied within the specified cure period in the Merger Agreement; or 

• we experience a material adverse effect that cannot be remedied, or at least 20 business days have elapsed since the material adverse effect occurred.

Termination Fee and Expenses (page 87)

       We will be required to pay a termination fee of $75 million to SAP if at any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, our Board determines to terminate the
Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that

Table of Contents

such termination will not be effective unless we, concurrently with such termination, enter into the alternative acquisition agreement and pay the required termination fee. See "The Merger
Agreement — Termination Fee and Expenses" beginning on page 87 of this proxy statement.

       We will be required to pay a termination fee of $75 million to SAP if the Merger Agreement is terminated by SAP for any of the reasons set forth in the first six bullets under the header
above captioned "— Termination of the Merger Agreement — by SAP if."

       We will also be required to pay a termination fee of $75 million to SAP if:

• the Merger Agreement is terminated by either SAP or us for any of the following reasons: 

o the Outside Date is reached, and (1) our stockholders have not adopted the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders or (2) SAP would then be
entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement as a result of our willful breach of the Merger Agreement; 

o our stockholders do not adopt the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders; or 

o a willful breach of the Merger Agreement by us; and 

• prior to the date of such termination of the Merger Agreement, an acquisition proposal has been made known to us or publicly disclosed (and not publicly withdrawn
prior to such termination) and concurrently with, or within 12 months after, such termination, we either (i) consummate a transaction that constitutes an acquisition
proposal, or (ii) enter into a definitive agreement to engage in a transaction or a tender offer is commenced that, in either case, constitutes an acquisition proposal, and
such transaction or tender offer is subsequently consummated or completed (whether or not such consummation or completion occurs before or after the 12-month
period following such termination). However, if the party with which a transaction or tender offer is ultimately consummated is the same party that made an acquisition
proposal prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the requirement that a breach by us be "willful," in the first and third sub-bullets of the preceding bullet will
be disregarded for purposes of determining if SAP if entitled to the termination fee.

       Solely for purposes of this paragraph, an acquisition proposal is an offer or proposal concerning, for or relating to (1) the purchase of, or commencement of a tender offer that if
consummated would result in the acquisition of, 50% or more of our equity interests of voting securities; (2) the acquisition of 50% or more of any class of equity or other voting security of
one or more of our subsidiaries, which subsidiaries individually or in the aggregate generate 50% or more of our consolidated net revenues or net income or constitute more than 50% of our
consolidated assets; (3) a merger, consolidation, business combination or another similar transaction, involving us or one or more of our subsidiaries, the businesses of which individually or in
the aggregate generate or constitute 50% or more of our consolidated net revenues or net income or assets, where our stockholders or the stockholders of our subsidiaries, as applicable,
immediately preceding such transaction would hold less than 50% of the stock or the voting securities in the surviving entity of such transaction; (4) the liquidation, dissolution,
recapitalization or reorganization of Callidus or any of our subsidiaries other than a wholly-owned subsidiary; (5) the sale of our or our subsidiaries' assets which assets generate 50% or more
of our consolidated net revenues or net income or constitute more than 50% of our consolidated assets; or (6) any combination of the foregoing.

Guaranty

       Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, SAP SE has absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed the payment and performance of SAP's and Merger Sub's obligations
under the Merger Agreement (including liabilities for a breach by SAP or Merger Sub of their obligations).

Regulatory Matters (page 60)

       The HSR Act prohibits us from completing the merger until we have furnished certain information and materials to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal
Trade Commission and the required waiting period has expired or been terminated. On February 12, 2018, the parties filed their respective notification and report forms pursuant to the HSR
Act with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. On February 22, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
terminated the waiting period under the HSR Act.

       The merger is also subject to review by the governmental authorities of various other jurisdictions under the antitrust or competition laws of those jurisdictions. Affiliates of SAP and
Callidus conduct business outside of the United States.

• German Antitrust Law: The Act against Restraints of Competition requires SAP and Callidus to file a notification with the Federal Cartel Office ("FCO") and provides
that the merger shall not occur until a one-month waiting period has expired or otherwise been terminated. The parties filed such notification with the FCO in connection
with the merger on February 14, 2018. 

• Austrian Antitrust Law: Under the Austrian Cartel Act, the merger may not be completed until the expiration of a four-week waiting period following the filing of a
notification with the Austrian Federal Competition Authority ("FCA"), unless the waiting period is terminated early. The parties filed such notification with the FCA in
connection with the merger on February 15, 2018. 

• Cyprus Antitrust Law: The Control of Concentrations Between Undertakings Law No. 83(I) of 2014 (Concentrations Law) requires SAP and Callidus to file a
notification with the Commission of the Protection of Competition ("CPC") and provides that the merger shall not occur until a one-month waiting has expired or
otherwise been terminated. The parties filed such notification with the CPC in connection with the merger on February 15, 2018.

Based on a review of the information currently available relating to the countries and businesses in which SAP and Callidus are engaged, SAP and Callidus believe that no other mandatory
antitrust premerger notification filing is required.

Market Prices and Dividend Data (page 21)

       Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol "CALD." On January 29, 2018, the last full trading day before the public announcement of the merger, the
closing price for our common stock was $32.70 per share, and on February 21, 2018, the latest practicable trading day before the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price for our
common stock was $35.80 per share.

       We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock.

Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 57)

       The conversion of shares of our common stock into the right to receive $36.00 per share of cash merger consideration generally will be a taxable transaction to our U.S. stockholders for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. See "The Merger — Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 57 of this proxy statement.

       Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular circumstances. We strongly recommend that you consult your own tax
advisor to determine how the merger will affect you.

Appraisal Rights (page 53)

       If the merger is completed, holders of Callidus common stock will be entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"). A holder who is
entitled to demand appraisal may elect to pursue his or her appraisal rights to receive the judicially determined fair value of his or her shares, which could be more or less than, or the same as,
the per share merger consideration for the common stock, but only if he or she has properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with, and complied in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL. For a more detailed discussion of appraisal rights and the requirements for properly demanding such rights, see "The Merger — Appraisal Rights" beginning on
page 53 of this proxy statement and Annex C to this proxy statement. An executed proxy that is not marked "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" will, unless revoked, be voted "FOR" the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and will disqualify the stockholder submitting that proxy from demanding appraisal rights.

       A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex C to this proxy statement.

       ANY CALLIDUS STOCKHOLDER WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS OR WHO WISHES TO PRESERVE HIS, HER OR ITS RIGHT TO DO SO
SHOULD REVIEW ANNEX C CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY AND SHOULD CONSULT HIS, HER OR ITS LEGAL ADVISOR, SINCE FAILURE TO TIMELY AND
PROPERLY COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH THEREIN WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF SUCH RIGHTS.

Additional Information (page 95)

       You can find more information about Callidus in the periodic reports and other information we file with the SEC. The information is available at the SEC's public reference facilities and at
the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov. For a more detailed description of the additional information available, see "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 95

Dividends

       We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. In the event that the merger is not consummated, we would expect to retain earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth
of our business and would not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In the event that the merger is not consummated, our payment of any future
dividends would be at the discretion of our Board after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, cash needs and growth plans.

amended from time to time ("Merger Agreement"); (ii) approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Callidus's named executive officers
based on or otherwise relating to the merger ("compensation proposal"); and (iii) approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date, if our Board determines that it is necessary or
appropriate and is permitted by the Merger Agreement, to solicit additional proxies if there is not a quorum present or there are not sufficient votes in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement at the time of the special meeting ("adjournment proposal").

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum

       Only holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on February 15, 2018, the record date, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. On the record date,
66,460,419 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and held by approximately 19 holders of record. Holders of record of our common stock on the record date are entitled to
one vote per share at the special meeting on each of the proposals.

       A majority of the outstanding shares of common stock must be present or represented at the special meeting in order to have a quorum for the conduct of business. Votes cast at the special
meeting, by proxy or in person, will be tabulated by the inspector of elections appointed for the special meeting. If shares are present at the special meeting in person or by proxy, but are not
voted, those shares will count toward determining whether or not a quorum is present for the conduct of business at the Meeting, as will all shares voted "for", "against" or "abstain" on a
proposal.

       In the event that a quorum is not present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, it is expected that the Board will recommend adjournment of the special meeting to
solicit additional proxies if permitted by the Merger Agreement. If there is not a quorum of stockholders at the special meeting and the vote with respect to the adjournment proposal fails, our
Board, if permitted by the Merger Agreement, may set a new record date and meeting date for a special meeting to consider the Merger Agreement, compensation proposal and adjournment
proposal.

Vote Required

       The adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the Merger
Agreement at the close of business on the record date. Adoption of the Merger Agreement is a condition to the closing of the merger.

       The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the compensation proposal at the special
meeting will constitute approval of the compensation proposal on an advisory basis. Our Board will consider the result of this vote, but because the proposal is advisory only it will not be
binding on either Callidus or SAP.

       Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote on the adjournment proposal at the special meeting (even if less than a quorum).

Voting by Callidus Directors and Executive Officers

       At the close of business on the record date, our directors and executive officers and their affiliates owned and were entitled to vote 601,659 shares of our common stock, which represented
approximately 0.91% of the shares of our outstanding common stock on that date. We expect that these directors and executive officers will vote all of their shares of our common stock "FOR"
adoption of the Merger Agreement, "FOR" the advisory compensation proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

       Certain members of our management and our Board have interests in the merger that are in addition to those of stockholders generally and may be different from, or in conflict with, your
interests as a Callidus stockholder. See the section entitled "The Merger — Interests of Callidus Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 47 of this proxy statement.

Voting of Proxies

       If your shares are registered in your name, you may cause your shares to be voted at the special meeting by returning a signed proxy card or voting in person at the meeting. Additionally,
you may submit a proxy authorizing the voting of your shares via the Internet at www.proxyvote.com or by telephone by calling (800) 690-6903. You must have the enclosed proxy card
available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to submit a proxy via the Internet or by telephone.

       If your shares are registered in your name and you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the meeting. If your shares are registered in
your name, you are encouraged to submit a proxy card even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person.

       Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in
accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted "FOR" the adoption of the Merger Agreement, "FOR" the
compensation proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal; provided, however, that no proxy that is specifically marked "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will be
voted "FOR" the compensation proposal or "FOR" the adjournment proposal unless it is specifically marked "FOR" the compensation proposal or "FOR" the adjournment proposal,
respectively.

       If your shares are held in "street name" through a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, you may provide voting instructions by completing and returning the voting form provided
by your nominee or via the Internet or by telephone through your nominee, if such a service is provided. To provide voting instructions via the Internet or telephone, you should follow the
instructions on the voting form provided by your nominee. If you plan to attend the special meeting, you will need a proxy from your nominee in order to be given a ballot to vote the shares. If
you do not return your nominee's voting form, provide voting instructions via the Internet or by telephone through your nominee or attend the special meeting and vote in person with a proxy
from your nominee, it will have the same effect as if you voted

"AGAINST" the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and will have no effect on the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.

Revocability of Proxies

       Any proxy you give pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by you at any time before it is voted. Proxies may be revoked as follows:

       If you have sent a proxy directly to Callidus, you may revoke it by:

• delivering a written revocation of the proxy or a later dated, signed proxy card, to our General Counsel at 4140 Dublin Boulevard, Suite 400, Dublin, California 94568,
on or before the business day prior to the special meeting; 

• delivering a new, later dated proxy via the Internet or by telephone until the date set forth in the instructions for voting via the Internet or by telephone; 

• delivering a written revocation or a later dated, signed proxy card to us at the special meeting prior to the taking of the vote on the matters to be considered at the special
meeting; or 

• attending the special meeting and voting in person.

       If you have instructed a broker or nominee to vote your shares, you may revoke your proxy only by following the directions received from your broker or nominee to change those
instructions.

       Your attendance at the special meeting does not alone automatically revoke your proxy. If you have instructed your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote your shares,
the above-described options for revoking your proxy do not apply. Instead, you must follow the directions provided by your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee to change your vote.

Board's Recommendations

       Our Board has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and determined that the Merger Agreement and the merger are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Callidus and its
stockholders. Our Board unanimously recommends that Callidus stockholders (i) vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) vote "FOR" the advisory
compensation proposal and (iii) vote "FOR" the adjournment proposal. See "The Merger — Recommendation of Callidus's Board and Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 34 of
this proxy statement. Callidus stockholders should carefully read this proxy statement in its entirety for more detailed information concerning the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the merger. In addition, Callidus stockholders are directed to the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.

Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

       Abstentions and shares not in attendance at the special meeting and not voted by proxy will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. Shares not in attendance at the special meeting and not voted
by proxy will have no effect on the advisory compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal. Because brokerage firms, banks, trusts or other nominees holding shares of Callidus common
stock in "street name" may not vote your shares of Callidus common stock on the adoption of the Merger Agreement, the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal unless you
provide instructions on how to vote, your failure to provide instructions will result in your shares not being present at the meeting and not being voted on those proposals. It is very important

interview, mail, e-mail, telephone, facsimile or other means of communication. These persons will not be paid additional remuneration for their efforts. We have also retained D.F.

certificates with your proxy card. A letter of transmittal with instructions for the surrender of your stock certificates, if any, will be mailed to our stockholders as soon as practicable after
completion of the merger.

THE MERGER

       The following discussion describes material aspects of the merger. While we believe that the following description covers the material terms of the merger, the description may not contain
all of the information that may be important to you. The discussion of the merger in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. We encourage you to read carefully this entire proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, for
a more complete understanding of the merger.

Background to the Merger

       Our Board, together with our management and with the assistance of our advisors, has from time to time reviewed and considered various strategic and other opportunities available to
Callidus to enhance stockholder value. These reviews included discussions as to whether the continued execution of our strategy as a standalone company or the possible sale of Callidus to a
third party offered the best avenue to maximize stockholder value, and the potential benefits and risks of any such course of action.

       At the end of the second quarter of 2016, SAP became a customer of Callidus pursuant to a services subscription agreement, and in the second half of 2016, we entered into a strategic
OEM agreement with SAP to integrate certain Callidus solutions with SAP solutions to drive sales performance. As part of these commercial relationships, our management team regularly
communicated and met with SAP.

       On July 20, 2017, in Walldorf, Germany, Christian Klein, executive vice president and chief operating officer at SAP, met with Leslie Stretch, our president and chief executive officer, and
Martin Schleipfer, our senior account executive. At the meeting, Mr. Klein discussed the success of the SAP-Callidus commercial partnership and his belief that SAP and Callidus share
common cultural values. Mr. Klein did not make any specific proposal regarding a potential transaction at that time.

       On July 27, 2017, our Board held a regularly scheduled board meeting, with participation from representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West. Qatalyst Partners had been
invited to the meeting in order to deliver a presentation updating our Board on the market environment and providing a perspective on potential strategic combinations within the sector, but
had not been formally engaged to represent Callidus in any such transaction at such time. During the meeting, Mr. Stretch discussed his conversations with SAP and updated our Board on our
strategic relationship with SAP. Our Board discussed establishing a process, including a subcommittee of our Board, to facilitate any consideration of an offer by SAP, if received.
Representatives of Qatalyst Partners delivered their presentation and led a discussion regarding other companies that could have a strategic interest in acquiring Callidus.

       On August 29, 2017, in Danville, California, Arlen Shenkman, SAP's executive vice president, global business development and ecosystems, met with Mr. Stretch. At the meeting,
Mr. Shenkman indicated that SAP might be interested in pursuing an acquisition of Callidus. However, Mr. Shenkman did not provide a specific proposal or initiate formal discussions
regarding such a transaction.

       On September 19, 2017, in Las Vegas, Nevada, at a business conference hosted by Callidus for its customers, executives from SAP and Callidus met to discuss the existing commercial
partnership between the two companies and also publicly announced the launch of an integrated solution combining the CallidusCloud Configure Price Quote and the SAP Hybris Cloud for
Customer solutions. On the same date, Mr. Stretch met with Mr. Shenkman and Rob Enslin, SAP executive board member and president, business cloud group. Mr. Shenkman and Mr. Enslin
indicated that SAP was considering making a proposal to acquire Callidus. Mr. Stretch stated that he would discuss any such offers with our Board. Mr. Shenkman asked Mr. Stretch for a
meeting with our executive team, including Mr. Stretch, Roxanne Oulman, our chief financial officer and Giles House, our chief product officer, to review our business in

more detail and confirm their view of our business. The next day, Mr. Shenkman sent Mr. Stretch a draft agenda for the meeting and, noting that they would like to discuss non-public
information, a draft mutual non-disclosure agreement. On September 21, 2017, SAP and Callidus negotiated and entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement, which included a 12-month
standstill. The standstill provision did not restrict SAP from making confidential proposals to, or from requesting a waiver of the standstill from, our Board.

       On September 22, 2017, Mr. Stretch and Ms. Oulman spoke with representatives of Qatalyst Partners about the discussions with SAP. Also on September 22, 2017, our Board held a
special meeting, together with representatives of Qatalyst Partners. At the meeting, Mr. Stretch updated our Board on discussions with SAP. Additionally, representatives of Qatalyst Partners
provided our Board with an overview of the market landscape, including recent trends and market outlook as well as the mergers and acquisitions environment for technology companies,
particularly SaaS companies. Our Board further discussed SAP's interest in Callidus and the possibility that it would make a formal proposal. At the meeting, our Board established a Strategic
Advisory Committee of the Board, consisting of Chuck Boesenberg, Kevin Klausmeyer and Mr. Stretch, to work with our management and our outside advisors, and to facilitate our Board's
consideration and review of strategic options for Callidus.

       On September 25, 2017, Mr. Stretch, Ms. Oulman and Mr. House met with representatives of SAP to provide a confidential overview of our operations, customers and financial
performance.

       On September 26, 2017, the Strategic Advisory Committee held a meeting, together with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and members of our management. At the meeting, Mr. Stretch
updated the Strategic Advisory Committee on the management meeting with SAP on September 25. Additionally, representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed customary process steps in a
potential strategic combination, including outreach to potentially interested parties, due diligence and negotiation of a definitive agreement.

       On September 27, 2017, our Board held a special meeting, during which Mr. Stretch updated our Board on the September 25 meeting with SAP. Our Board further discussed retaining a
financial advisor to represent Callidus in our negotiations with SAP and our investigation of potential alternative strategic transactions. Our Board considered Qatalyst Partners' qualifications,
expertise and reputation, its knowledge of our industry and its close familiarity with the Board, our business and management team, as well as Qatalyst Partners' prior experience representing
other companies in transactions with SAP. Following such consideration, our Board determined to engage Qatalyst Partners as its financial advisor with respect to any sale, transfer or other
disposition of majority ownership of the capital stock of Callidus or a majority of the assets of Callidus.

       On October 11, 2017, we entered into an agreement to formally engage Qatalyst Partners as our exclusive financial advisor with respect to a potential change of control transaction.

       On October 23, 2017, at its regularly scheduled board meeting, our Board discussed, among other things, the prospects for a potential sale transaction. Representatives of Fenwick & West
attended the meeting and reviewed with our Board its fiduciary duties in considering a potential change of control transaction.

       The board meeting continued on October 24, 2017, with participation from representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West. At the meeting, our management and the Board
discussed our financial plan for fiscal years 2017 through 2020. In addition, representatives of Qatalyst Partners made a presentation regarding a preliminary valuation of Callidus. Our Board,
with input from representatives of Qatalyst Partners, discussed our business prospects on a stand-alone basis. Our Board also discussed raising additional capital as a means of expanding our
operations.

       On October 26, 2017, Mr. Stretch spoke with Mr. Enslin, and Mr. Enslin reiterated SAP's interest in a strategic transaction with Callidus. However, Mr. Enslin did not provide a specific
proposal at this time.

       On November 6, 2017, Mr. Stretch contacted Mr. Shenkman to follow up on the management meeting of September 25, 2017. Mr. Shenkman indicated that SAP was still evaluating the
opportunity and did not have any further update at that time, but indicated that SAP would respond within two weeks.

       On November 24, 2017, Mr. Stretch again followed up with Mr. Shenkman, and Mr. Shenkman indicated that SAP would send a proposal by the end of the following week.

       On November 30, 2017, SAP delivered to us a written non-binding preliminary indication of interest proposing an all-cash acquisition of Callidus at a price of $34.00 per share. The
indication of interest noted that this valuation represented a premium of 28% to our 90-day volume-weighted average price and a premium of 13% to our 52-week high price. The indication of
interest stated that SAP's proposed transaction would not be subject to any financing contingency. The indication of interest also stated that in order for SAP to proceed with its due diligence of
Callidus and negotiation of a potential transaction, SAP would require that we agree to a 30-day exclusivity period. Later that day, our Strategic Advisory Committee held a special meeting,
with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West in attendance, to discuss the indication of interest submitted by SAP, and scheduled a special meeting of our full Board on the
following day. On November 30, 2017, the closing price for shares of our common stock was $29.28, and the $34.00 offer price represented a 16% premium to the closing price.

       On December 1, 2017, our Board held a meeting, together with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West. The representatives of Fenwick & West reviewed with our Board
its fiduciary duties in the context of evaluating the SAP proposal. Our Board discussed with our management our business prospects on a stand-alone basis. The representatives of Qatalyst
Partners made a presentation regarding a preliminary valuation of Callidus, and the financial aspects of SAP's proposal of $34.00 per share. Following such discussion, our Board determined
that SAP's proposal of $34.00 per share represented insufficient value and instructed Mr. Stretch and Qatalyst Partners to negotiate with SAP to seek a higher purchase price, and that a higher
price was necessary in order for Callidus to agree to enter into an exclusivity agreement at this time. Our Board also discussed other potential companies that might have the strategic interest
and financial resources to acquire Callidus, and determined that only four other parties would likely have sufficient strategic interest and financial resources to consider acquiring Callidus,
which we refer to in this proxy statement as Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D. Our Board further concluded that it was not advisable to contact additional parties that would be less likely
to have such resources or interest, because such contacts would be unlikely to result in an attractive offer and would increase the risk of a public disclosure regarding our consideration of a
potential acquisition transaction, resulting in potentially significant adverse effects on our business. Accordingly, our Board directed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to reach out to each of
those companies regarding a potential acquisition transaction. Later that day, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted Party A, Party B, Party C and Party D via email. Later that same
evening, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke to a representative of Party A by phone regarding their interest in a potential acquisition of Callidus.

       On December 2, 2017, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke to a representative of Party C by phone regarding their interest in a potential acquisition of Callidus.

       On December 4, 2017, representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke to a representative of Party B by phone regarding their interest in a potential acquisition of Callidus. Later the same day,
representatives of Qatalyst Partners spoke by phone a second time with a representative of Party B and had a separate phone call with a representative of Party A. Representatives of both Party
A and Party B informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that they were not interested in pursuing an acquisition of Callidus.

       On December 5, 2017, Mr. Stretch called Mr. Shenkman and informed him that SAP's offer of $34.00 per share represented insufficient value for our shareholders, and noted that our
Board anticipated that it would report strong performance for our fourth fiscal quarter. Mr. Stretch emphasized our Board's belief in our prospects as a standalone company and execution of our
strategic vision. Mr. Shenkman reiterated SAP's interest in acquiring Callidus.

       On December 6, 2017, a representative of Qatalyst Partners contacted Mr. Shenkman and reiterated this message. The parties discussed the elements of a proposal that might be acceptable
to our Board, including an increased purchase price, expedited deal timing and key protections around the certainty of closing the transaction. Later on the same day, representatives of Qatalyst
Partners spoke with a representative of Party D by phone regarding its interest in a potential acquisition of Callidus.

       On December 8, 2017, Party C informed representatives of Qatalyst Partners that it was not interested in pursuing an acquisition of Callidus.

       On December 8, 2017, a reporter attempted to contact a representative of Qatalyst Partners to indicate that she had heard rumors about a potential sale transaction and to solicit feedback
about such rumors. No representative of Qatalyst Partners responded to this inquiry.

       Also on December 8, 2017, a representative from Party E, a financial sponsor, contacted representatives of Qatalyst Partners and indicated that Party E had heard that Callidus was engaged
in discussions with potential acquirors about a potential sale, and that Party E would like to participate in such discussions. A representative of Qatalyst Partners responded that while it
regularly advised Callidus on strategic matters, Qatalyst Partners would not comment on whether Callidus was engaged in such discussions, but that our Board would consider a compelling
offer from Party E with respect to an acquisition proposal. Later that day, Party E reached out to Mr. Stretch, and he responded similarly that our Board would consider any compelling offer.

       Later on December 8, 2017, the Strategic Advisory Committee held a special meeting, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West. The committee discussed Party E's
communications with Mr. Stretch and representatives of Qatalyst Partners, and the Strategic Advisory Committee instructed Qatalyst Partners to engage with Party E to determine their interest
in an acquisition of Callidus.

       On December 9, 2017, at the direction of the Strategic Advisory Committee, a representative from Qatalyst Partners discussed a potential acquisition of Callidus with Party E.

       On December 11, 2017, our Board held a meeting, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West. Mr. Stretch reported to the Board on his discussions with Mr. Shenkman
on December 5, 2017 and reviewed the events of December 8, 2017. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners also provided an update on the outreach to parties potentially interested in a potential
acquisition of Callidus. Our Board also discussed the recent communications with the other parties contacted regarding a potential acquisition of Callidus, and the fact that each of the parties
(other than Party D, who had not responded to our inquiries) had stated that they were not interested in pursuing an acquisition of Callidus.

       On December 12, 2017, Party E informed a representative of Qatalyst Partners that Party E did not intend to pursue an acquisition of Callidus.

       On December 13, 2017, representatives of Qatalyst Partners contacted Mr. Shenkman to ask for a revised indication of interest. On December 15, 2017, Mr. Shenkman responded that SAP
would have a meeting of its Executive Board, and that Callidus should expect a response from SAP on December 18, 2017.

       On December 18, 2017, SAP delivered to us a revised written non-binding preliminary indication of interest proposing an all-cash acquisition of Callidus at a price of $35.00 per share. In
its revised indication of interest, SAP stated that it would not proceed with the negotiation of a transaction at the increased price of $35.00 per share or start their due diligence exercise unless
Callidus agreed to a 30-day exclusivity period, and attached a proposed exclusivity agreement.

       Later that day, our Board held a meeting, together with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed with our Board the
financial aspects of SAP's proposal of $35.00 per share. Our Board discussed with our management our business prospects on a stand-alone basis. Our Board determined that SAP's proposal of
$35.00 per share represented insufficient value, and instructed representatives of Qatalyst Partners to submit a counteroffer to SAP at $37.50 per share.

       On December 19, 2017, representatives of Qatalyst Partners delivered a counteroffer to SAP at $37.50 per share.

       On December 21, 2017, Mr. Shenkman contacted Mr. Stretch and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and informed them that SAP would submit a best and final offer of $36.00 per share.
A representative of Qatalyst Partners reached out to Mr. Shenkman later in the day and encouraged Mr. Shenkman to consider a higher offer, and indicated that the Board may find an offer of
$36.00 per share to represent insufficient value for our stockholders. Mr. Shenkman reiterated that the $36.00 per share was SAP's best and final offer. Subsequently, SAP delivered to us a final
written non-binding preliminary indication of interest proposing an all-cash acquisition of Callidus at a price of $36.00 per share. The final indication of interest again insisted that Callidus
agree to a 30-day exclusivity period, and said that SAP would not proceed with the negotiation of a transaction at the increased price of $36.00 unless we entered into an exclusivity agreement
with SAP.

       Later that day, our Board held a meeting, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West participating. The representatives of Qatalyst Partners discussed with our Board the
financial aspects of SAP's revised proposal of $36.00 per share. Our Board and Qatalyst Partners discussed whether there were any other potential acquirers for Callidus that would be in a
position to consummate a transaction on better terms than those offered by SAP and, following such discussion, our Board determined that the parties already contacted by Callidus and
Qatalyst Partners were the most likely candidates for any such transaction with Callidus. Our Board discussed the merits and risks of contacting other parties, including the risk of SAP
withdrawing its indication of interest and the likelihood of being able to find a potential buyer that would make a higher offer at this time, as well as the risk of a public disclosure that could
harm our business. Our Board also discussed SAP's requirement that Callidus agree to a 30-day exclusivity arrangement in order for SAP to proceed. Our Board and representatives of
Fenwick & West discussed the circumstances under which Callidus would be entitled to negotiate with third parties making an acquisition proposal after an agreement with SAP was signed,
and the circumstances under which our Board could exercise its fiduciary duties to terminate an executed merger agreement with SAP and accept a competing proposal. After further
discussion, and taking into consideration its discussions with our management and representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West, and the increase in price offered by SAP, our
Board determined that it would be in the best interests of Callidus's stockholders to proceed with negotiations with SAP based on its indication of interest on an exclusive basis. Our Board
approved the indication of interest containing the price per share of $36.00, including the obligation to negotiate exclusively with SAP for 30 days, and authorized our management team to
negotiate and enter into an exclusivity agreement with SAP. Late on December 21, 2017, Mr. Stretch informed Mr. Shenkman of our Board's decision.

       On December 22, 2017, representatives of Callidus and Fenwick & West discussed the exclusivity agreement with a representative of Jones Day, outside counsel to SAP, and in the course
of that discussion,

the representative of Jones Day indicated that SAP would not be able to proceed to due diligence and negotiation of a merger agreement if we did not enter into the exclusivity agreement.
During such discussions, SAP requested that the terms of the exclusivity agreement provide that we would negotiate the terms of a potential acquisition exclusively with SAP until 11:59 pm
on January 30, 2018. We agreed to that request and executed the exclusivity agreement on December 23, 2017, and SAP executed it on December 26, 2017. On December 26, 2017, SAP
delivered to Callidus a due diligence request list requesting documents and information relating to our business, products and technology, finance, accounting and tax, legal matters,
procurement, employee benefits and other matters.

       On December 29, 2017, representatives and advisors for SAP were granted access to an online data room for purposes of SAP's due diligence review of Callidus. During the period from
December 29, 2017 to January 28, 2018 representatives of SAP and its legal and financial advisors engaged in extensive due diligence activities with Callidus and our legal and financial
advisors.

       On January 3, 2018, our Board held a meeting, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West participating, to discuss the due diligence process with SAP.

       On January 4 and January 5, 2018, representatives of Callidus and SAP, together with their outside legal advisors, held a series of due diligence meetings at the offices of Jones Day,
outside counsel to SAP, in Palo Alto regarding our business, products and technology, finance, accounting and tax, legal matters, procurement, employee benefits and other topics. At these
meetings, our management provided SAP with a subset of the financial projections prepared by our management and summarized below under "— Financial Projections". These projections
were based on the financial plan previously discussed with our Board, updated for the impact of the acquisition of Learning Seat on December 4, 2017 (as well as certain other minor updates
as a result of our recently completed budget review) and included prospective financial information about the fourth quarter of our 2017 fiscal year, our 2018 fiscal year and our 2019 fiscal
year. Following these meetings, Callidus and its representatives continued to respond to additional diligence requests and hold numerous follow-up calls and meetings to discuss further
questions raised and requests made by SAP and its representatives.

       On January 8, 2018, representatives of Allen & Overy LLP ("Allen & Overy") and Jones Day, outside co-counsel to SAP, delivered a draft of the Merger Agreement to Fenwick & West,
reflecting proposed definitive terms of the transaction, including a proposed termination fee of 4.5% of the equity value of the transaction. The draft included customary restrictions on
soliciting other proposals that allowed us to negotiate with respect to unsolicited alternative proposals, and to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to a
superior proposal.

       On January 9, 2018, our Board held a meeting, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West participating. Representatives of Fenwick & West discussed the terms of the
draft Merger Agreement, including, among other things, the size and terms of the proposed termination fee, our Board's ability to consider unsolicited alternative proposals, and conditions to
closing.

       On January 11, 2018, our Board held a meeting, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West participating. Representatives of Fenwick & West discussed the terms of the
draft Merger Agreement with our Board in further detail, advised our Board of their fiduciary duties in considering the Merger Agreement and led a discussion with our Board regarding our
negotiations with SAP. Our Board provided guidance on the terms of the draft Merger Agreement, and instructed management to negotiate a termination fee closer to 3% of the equity value of
the transaction.

       On January 14, 2018, Fenwick & West provided to Jones Day and Allen & Overy proposed revisions to the draft Merger Agreement, including among other terms, a proposed termination
fee equal to 2.5% of the equity value of the transaction.

       On January 15, 2018, the Strategic Advisory Committee met, together with representatives of Fenwick & West. The Strategic Advisory Committee discussed the terms of the proposed
Merger Agreement, including the outside date for consummating the merger, the treatment of our outstanding equity awards and the regulatory approvals that would be required to consummate
the transaction.

       On January 17, 2018, our Board met, with advisors from Fenwick & West participating. Later that day, Allen & Overy provided to Fenwick & West proposed revisions to the draft Merger
Agreement, including among other terms, a proposed termination fee equal to 4.5% of the equity value of the transaction.

       On January 18, 2018, the closing price for shares of our common stock increased to $30.40. The same day, our Strategic Advisory Committee met, together with representatives of
Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West. Our Strategic Advisory Committee discussed the rising stock price of Callidus. Following a discussion, our Strategic Advisory Committee directed
representatives of Qatalyst Partners to approach SAP and ask it to increase the purchase price for the proposed transaction.

       On January 19, 2018, representatives of Fenwick & West and Drew Grasham, our general counsel, as well as representatives of SAP, Jones Day and Allen & Overy met at the offices of
Jones Day in Palo Alto, California, to discuss the open issues in the draft Merger Agreement, including the termination fee payable by Callidus, the triggers for payment of the termination fee,
the regulatory approvals required for closing of the transaction, the representations and warranties to be made by Callidus and the restrictions on Callidus's activities, and other covenants
applicable to the parties, between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the earlier of the closing of the transaction and the termination of the Merger Agreement. In addition,
representatives of Fenwick & West and Callidus proposed a termination fee of 2.5% of the equity value of the transaction and the representatives of SAP, Allen & Overy and Jones Day
expressed a strong desire for the termination fee to be in the region of 4.0%.

       On January 20, 2018, Fenwick & West provided to Jones Day and Allen & Overy proposed revisions to the draft Merger Agreement, including among other terms, a proposed termination
fee of 2.5% of the equity value of the transaction. The parties and their legal counsel continued to negotiate the terms of the Merger Agreement through January 29, 2018.

       On January 21, 2018, a representative of Qatalyst Partners spoke with Mr. Shenkman of SAP and indicated that our Board may be unwilling to approve the transaction unless SAP raised
its price beyond $36.00 per share, and encouraged SAP to increase the per share offer price.

       On January 22, 2018, Mr. Shenkman contacted a representative of Qatalyst Partners and said that SAP was unwilling to raise its price, and reiterated that SAP's offer to purchase Callidus
at a price of $36.00 per share was its best and final offer. Later that day, the Strategic Advisory Committee met, together with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West. A
representative of Qatalyst Partners informed the members of the Strategic Advisory Committee about the communications it had with SAP and SAP's refusal to increase the proposed price for
the transaction. The members of the Strategic Advisory Committee directed our management and advisors to continue negotiating the draft Merger Agreement, and also instructed Qatalyst
Partners to again approach SAP with a proposal to raise its price.

       On January 23, 2018, Mr. Stretch and Mr. Shenkman discussed the proposed transaction. Mr. Stretch reiterated the request that SAP raise the price beyond $36.00 per share, which
Mr. Shenkman rejected. The next day, a representative of Qatalyst Partners contacted Mr. Shenkman and again asked SAP to raise the per share price and also proposed that SAP accept a
termination fee of $75 million, which represented approximately 2.96% of the equity value of the transaction. Mr. Shenkman stated that $36.00 was SAP's best and final offer, but agreed to
accept a termination fee of $75 million. Mr. Stretch subsequently informed members of our Board of the discussions with Mr. Shenkman.

       On January 28, 2018, our Board met, together with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West, to discuss the transaction terms. Our Board reviewed the recent discussions
between Mr. Shenkman of SAP and Mr. Stretch and a representative of Qatalyst Partners. Representatives of Qatalyst Partners reviewed with our Board their financial analysis of the $36.00
per share cash consideration to be received by holders of shares of Callidus common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and indicated to our Board that Qatalyst Partners was prepared to
deliver an opinion to the effect that, as of the date such opinion was delivered and based on and subject to the considerations, limitations, qualifications and other matters set forth in such
opinion, the $36.00 per share cash consideration to be received by holders of shares of Callidus common stock (other than SAP or any of its affiliates) pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
terms of the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Members of our Board discussed the value of the proposed transaction to Callidus stockholders,
including various transaction multiples implied by the purchase price, the premium to Callidus's current and historical stock price and the execution risks of our operating plan as a standalone
company and the other factors described under "— Recommendation of Callidus's Board and Reasons for the Merger". Members of our Board also discussed their belief that the negotiated
termination fee of $75 million (2.96% of the equity value of the transaction, calculated using the treasury method) would not preclude any offers by interested third parties.

       On January 29, 2018, legal counsel for Callidus and SAP completed their negotiations of the Merger Agreement and related documents. Later that evening, the supervisory board of SAP
SE approved the acquisition of Callidus pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

       Later on January 29, 2018, our Board held a meeting, with representatives of Qatalyst Partners and Fenwick & West participating, to consider approval of the potential transaction.
Representatives of Qatalyst Partners updated their financial analysis of the $36.00 per share cash consideration to be received by holders of shares of Callidus common stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement that they had provided at the January 28, 2018 Board meeting. The Qatalyst Partners representatives informed our Board that there had been no material change in any of
the financial analyses previously provided by Qatalyst Partners at the January 28 Board meeting. The full text of the written opinion of Qatalyst Partners, with respect to the financial fairness
of the merger, dated January 29, 2018, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review
undertaken in connection with, such opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. See also "— Opinion of Callidus's Financial Advisor." Following review of the proposed terms of
the Merger Agreement and further discussions with management and its legal and financial advisors, our Board unanimously adopted resolutions that determined and declared that the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the merger, were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of, Callidus and its stockholders, approved and declared advisable
the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, authorized Callidus to execute, deliver and perform the Merger Agreement and recommended that our
stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. Our Board also unanimously approved the amendment and restatement of our bylaws to adopt an exclusive Delaware forum selection bylaw, having
determined that such amendment and adoption was in the best interests of our stockholders.

       Callidus, SAP and Merger Sub then executed the Merger Agreement and, shortly thereafter, released a joint press release announcing the signing of the Merger Agreement.

Recommendation of Callidus's Board and Reasons for the Merger

       At a meeting of our Board on January 29, 2018, our Board unanimously (1) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, (2) approved the execution, delivery and performance
of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and (3) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are
advisable, fair to and in the best

interests of Callidus and our stockholders. Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote (i) "FOR" the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (ii) "FOR" the advisory
compensation proposal and (iii) "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

       In evaluating the Merger Agreement and reaching its decision to declare that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable, fair to and in the best interests
of Callidus and our stockholders, and to approve the Merger Agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, our Board consulted with our
management and its financial advisor, Qatalyst Partners. Our Board also consulted with outside legal counsel regarding its fiduciary duties and the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement and other related matters. The following discussion includes the material reasons and factors that our Board considered in making its recommendation that Callidus stockholders
vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement, but is neither exhaustive nor intended to be exhaustive.

       Our Board considered the following factors in favor of the merger (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):

       Merger Consideration.    With respect to the merger consideration to be received by our stockholders, our Board considered:

• that our stockholders will be entitled to receive merger consideration of $36.00 per share in cash upon the closing of the merger, providing liquidity and certainty of
value as compared to the uncertain future long-term value that our stockholders might or might not realize if we remained an independent public company, enabling
them to realize value that had been created by Callidus, while eliminating the long-term business and execution risk; 

• the fact that the $36.00 per share value of the cash merger consideration represented a multiple of 9.8 times our revenue for the last twelve months ended September 30,
2017, a multiple of 8.3 times our projected revenue for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2018 (based on consensus analyst estimates as of January 26,
2018) and a multiple of 7.9 times our projected revenue for the calendar year 2018, and the fact that these revenue multiples exceeded the revenue multiples in
comparable merger transactions; 

• the fact that the $36.00 per share value of the cash merger consideration is a premium of 10% over the $32.70 closing price of our common stock on The Nasdaq Stock
Market on January 29, 2018, which was the 52-week and all-time high closing price of our common stock; 

• the fact that the $36.00 per share value of the cash merger consideration represents a 21% premium over the 30-day volume weighted average closing price of our
common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market as of January 29, 2018 (the last trading day prior to our Board's approval of the Merger Agreement) and a 28% premium
over the 90-day volume weighted average closing price; 

• the recent and historical market prices of our common stock, including the market price performance of our common stock relative to that of other industry participants
over the last 12 months, and the financial market conditions during that period (See "Market Prices and Dividend Data" beginning on page 21 of this proxy statement for
information about our common stock prices over time); 

• its belief, based on the course of negotiations between Callidus and SAP and the input from management and its financial advisor with respect to SAP's statements made
and positions taken during repeated negotiations, that $36.00 per share (which SAP increased from an initial

offer of $34.00 per share to the final offer of $36.00 per share during the course of negotiations, as more fully described under the section entitled "— Background of the
Merger" beginning on page 27 of this proxy statement) was the highest price SAP would be willing to pay for our common stock; and

• its belief, based on discussions with parties other than SAP and the understanding of our Board of the financial ability and likelihood that another counterparty having a
potential strategic interest would emerge, that it was unlikely that any other party would be willing to pay more than $36.00 per share in cash or otherwise engage in a
transaction with us that would be more favorable to Callidus and its stockholders than the merger.

       Solicitation of Interest.    Our Board considered the fact that, prior to entering into an exclusivity agreement with SAP SE, our Board, with the assistance of Qatalyst Partners considered
other potential acquirers, including an inbound inquiry from a financial sponsor, and actively solicited interest from other parties that our Board determined would likely have the financial
ability and strategic interest to be potentially interested in a business combination with us, and that each of the parties declined to pursue an acquisition of Callidus.

       Likelihood of Completion.    Our Board believed the business reputation of and existing relationship with SAP supported the conclusion that a transaction with SAP could be completed
relatively quickly and in an orderly manner and posed a relatively low risk of non-completion. Our Board considered the business reputation of SAP, including its history of successful
acquisitions, and the substantial financial resources of SAP. It also considered SAP's strong strategic interest in Callidus and its familiarity with Callidus and our products based on the existing
commercial partnerships between the companies, and its belief that SAP was highly likely to complete the acquisition.

       Prospects in Remaining Independent.    Our Board considered the possibility of us continuing to operate as an independent public company, including our relative strengths in the SaaS
industry and anticipated growth, in light of the risks and uncertainties of achieving elements of our business plan over the foreseeable future, as well as market and general economic risks. In
considering this alternative, our Board considered the following factors:

• the financial projections prepared by our management and summarized below under "— Financial Projections" beginning on page 45 of this proxy statement; 

• the potential for increased competition in the SaaS industry, including from larger competitors that have greater financial resources, larger sales forces, more extensive
international presence and the ability to bundle services that compete with ours with their other product and service offerings (and which could potentially include SAP),
as well as the importance of scale to compete in the SaaS industry and the trend of consolidation within the industry; 

• our historical revenue and operating results and financial prospects and the risks associated with achieving the Projections, including the difficulty of recruiting and
retaining qualified personnel in a highly-competitive staffing market, the risk that we might be unable to continue to increase our sales force to achieve desired
productivity levels and the significant investments we would have to make to continue our growth rate, including with respect to our learning and enablement solutions;
and 

• the fact that, even if we were to achieve our operating objectives, there would be no assurance that the implied present value of our future stock price would exceed the
$36.00 per share cash consideration to be paid in the merger.

       Opinion of Qatalyst Partners.    Our Board received the opinion of Qatalyst Partners that as of January 29, 2018, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners as set forth in its written opinion, the $36.00 per share cash consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of our common stock, other than SAP or any affiliates of SAP, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to such holders. The full text of the written opinion of Qatalyst Partners, dated as of January 29, 2018, is attached as Annex B and is incorporated by reference in this
proxy statement in its entirety. See also "— Opinion of Callidus's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 39 of this proxy statement.

       Timing of the Proposal; No Comparable Offer.    Our Board considered the timing of the merger and the risk that if Callidus did not accept the SAP offer now, it might not have another
opportunity to do so or a comparable opportunity might not arise because other potential acquirers may not value the diversity of our product offerings to the same extent as SAP.

       Terms of the Merger Agreement.    Our Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the course of robust, arms' length negotiations thereof, with the assistance
of advisors, including:

• the structure of the transaction as a merger, requiring approval by our stockholders, which would provide a period of time prior to stockholder approval during which an
unsolicited competing proposal could be made; 

• our ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with a third party, if our Board determines in good faith that the third party
has made an acquisition proposal that is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a superior proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement); 

• the ability of our Board, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, to consider and to accept an unsolicited superior proposal and
terminate the Merger Agreement, upon the payment to SAP of a termination fee of $75 million, in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior
proposal, as long as we have complied with the notice and other requirements (including SAP's matching rights) described under "The Merger Agreement —
Covenants — No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals; Change of Board Recommendation or Termination" beginning on page 76 of this proxy statement; 

• the ability of our Board, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, to withdraw or modify its recommendation that our stockholders
vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances in response to its receipt of a superior proposal, as long as we have complied with the
notice and other requirements (including SAP's matching rights) described under "The Merger Agreement — Covenants — No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals;
Change of Board Recommendation or Termination" beginning on page 76 of this proxy statement, and SAP's corresponding right to terminate the Merger Agreement
and be paid a fee of $75 million by us; 

• the ability of our Board, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, to change its recommendation in favor of adoption of the Merger
Agreement, under certain circumstances, in response to an intervening event (as defined in the Merger Agreement) as long as we have complied with the notice and
other requirements (including SAP's matching rights) described under "The Merger Agreement — Covenants — No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals; Change of
Board Recommendation or Termination"

beginning on page 76 of this proxy statement, and SAP's corresponding right to terminate the Merger Agreement and be paid a fee of $75 million by us;

• our Board's belief that the termination fee of $75 million would not preclude or substantially impede a possible competing proposal; 

• our ability to specifically enforce SAP's obligations under the Merger Agreement, including SAP's obligations to consummate the merger; 

• our Board's belief that we will retain sufficient operating flexibility to conduct our business in the ordinary course between the execution of the Merger Agreement and
consummation of the merger; 

• the conditions to SAP's obligation to complete the merger, including the absence of a financing condition, the absence of a need for a vote of SAP's stockholders and the
definition of material adverse effect as described on page 83 of this proxy statement; and 

• that our stockholders will be entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law.

       In the course of its deliberations, our Board also considered a variety of risks and factors weighing against the merger, including:

       Risks of Announcement; Risks of Closing.    Our Board considered:

• the risks and contingencies related to the announcement and pendency of the merger, including the potential impact on our employees and our relationships with existing
and prospective customers and business partners, as well as other third parties; 

• the conditions of SAP's obligation to complete the merger and the right of SAP to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain specified circumstances; 

• our risks and costs if the merger is not completed, including the diversion of management and employee attention, potential employee attrition, the potential impact on
our stock price and the effect on our business relationships, including with SAP; 

• the risks of a delay in receiving, or a failure to receive, the necessary antitrust approvals and clearances to complete the merger in the United States, Germany, Austria
and Cyprus, and the extent of SAP's obligations to expend efforts in seeking such approvals and clearances; 

• our obligations not to solicit proposals or offers that constitute, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, acquisition proposals; the limited circumstances in which we
may enter into, continue, or otherwise participate in any discussions regarding acquisition proposals, or agree to, accept, or recommend any acquisition proposals other
than as described above with respect to superior proposals; the ability of SAP to match a superior proposal; and the requirement that we pay a $75 million termination
fee to SAP related to a termination of the Merger Agreement in connection with a superior proposal in the circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, all of
which could dissuade another party from making an acquisition proposal for us.

       Cash Transaction.    Our Board considered that the merger consideration is cash and, as a result, our stockholders will forego any potential future increase in our value that might result
from our possible growth, and that gains realized as a result of the merger generally will be taxable to our stockholders.

       Limitations on Our Business.    Our Board considered the potential limitations on our pursuit of business opportunities due to pre-closing covenants in the Merger Agreement whereby we
agreed that we will carry on our business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and, subject to specified exceptions, not to take certain actions related to the conduct of
our business without the prior written consent of SAP.

       Interests of Directors and Officers.    Our Board was aware of, and considered, the interests that our directors and executive officers may have with respect to the merger in addition to their
interests as our stockholders generally, as described in "— Interests of Callidus Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 47 of this proxy statement.

       Exclusivity.    The fact that we entered into an exclusivity agreement, the execution of which SAP made a condition to its willingness to increase its offer price to $36.00 per share and
proceed with its proposal for a possible acquisition of Callidus at such increased price, limited the Board's ability to solicit bids from other potential buyers or to conduct a formal auction
process prior to entering into the Merger Agreement. However, in light of SAP's insistence on Callidus agreeing to pre-signing exclusivity obligations in order to proceed with the transaction
and the market check process conducted by the Board prior to signing the exclusivity agreement, the Board was of the view, after discussion with Callidus's legal and financial advisors, that
the risk of losing SAP's pursuit of a potential acquisition outweighed the possibility of receiving a more favorable proposal from another party.

       The foregoing discussion is not intended to be exhaustive, but we believe it addresses the material information and principal factors considered by our Board in its consideration of the
merger.

       In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, our Board did not find it practicable to, and did not,
quantify or otherwise attempt to assign relative weights to the various factors considered in reaching its determination, and individual directors may have given different weight to different
factors. In addition, our Board did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered. Instead, our Board conducted an overall analysis of the factors and
reasons described above and determined that, in the aggregate, the potential benefits considered outweighed the potential risks or possible negative consequences of approving the Merger
Agreement and based on the totality of the information presented to it and considered by it, accordingly recommends that our stockholders vote "FOR" the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

Opinion of Callidus's Financial Advisor

       We retained Qatalyst Partners to act as financial advisor to our Board in connection with a potential transaction such as the merger and to evaluate whether the $36.00 per share cash
consideration to be received by the holders of our common stock, other than SAP or any affiliates of SAP, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders. We selected Qatalyst Partners to act as our financial advisor based on Qatalyst Partners' qualifications, expertise, reputation, its knowledge of
the business and affairs of Callidus and the industry in which it operates and its close familiarity with the Board, our business and management team, as well as Qatalyst Partners' prior
experience representing other companies in transactions with SAP. Qatalyst Partners has provided its written consent to the reproduction of Qatalyst Partners' opinion in this proxy statement.
Qatalyst Partners delivered its written opinion, dated January 29, 2018, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the considerations, limitations, qualifications, assumptions and other
matters set forth therein, the $36.00 per share cash consideration to be received by the holders of our common stock, other than SAP or any affiliates of SAP, pursuant to, and in accordance
with, the terms of the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

       The full text of Qatalyst Partners' written opinion, dated January 29, 2018, to our Board is attached hereto as Annex B and is incorporated by reference herein. The opinion sets forth,
among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications of the review undertaken by Qatalyst Partners in rendering its opinion.
You should read the opinion carefully in its entirety. Qatalyst Partners' opinion was provided to our Board and addresses only, as of the date of the opinion, the fairness from a financial point of
view of the $36.00 per share cash consideration to be received by the holders of our common stock, other than SAP or any affiliates of SAP, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of
the Merger Agreement, and it does not address any other aspect of the merger. It does not constitute a recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote with respect to the merger or any
other matter and does not in any manner address the price at which our common stock will trade at any time. The summary of Qatalyst Partners' opinion set forth herein is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

       In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the Merger Agreement, certain related documents, and certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial
information of Callidus. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to Callidus prepared by our management, including financial projections and operating
data prepared by our management ("Company Projections") and which are described below in the section entitled "— Financial Projections." Additionally, Qatalyst Partners discussed our past
and current operations and financial condition and prospects with senior executives of Callidus. Qatalyst Partners also reviewed the historical market prices and trading activity for our
common stock and compared our financial performance and the prices and trading activity of our common stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their
securities. In addition, Qatalyst Partners reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such
other information and considered such other factors as Qatalyst Partners deemed appropriate.

       In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or
supplied or otherwise made available to, or discussed with, Qatalyst Partners by Callidus. With respect to the Company Projections, Qatalyst Partners was advised by our management, and
Qatalyst Partners assumed, that the Company Projections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of our management of our
capitalization and future financial performance and other matters covered thereby. Qatalyst Partners assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the
Merger Agreement, without any modification, waiver or delay. In addition, Qatalyst Partners assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed merger,
no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on Callidus or Parent or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed
merger. Qatalyst Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of our assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise), nor was Qatalyst Partners furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Qatalyst Partners relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of our management as to our existing and future technology and products
and the risks associated with such technology and products. Qatalyst Partners' opinion has been approved by Qatalyst Partners' opinion committee in accordance with its customary practice.

       Qatalyst Partners' opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion.
Events occurring after the date of the opinion may affect Qatalyst Partners' opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Qatalyst Partners has not assumed any obligation to update,
revise or reaffirm its opinion. Qatalyst Partners' opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Callidus to engage in the merger, or the relative merits of the merger as compared
to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Callidus. Qatalyst Partners' opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the $36.00

per share cash consideration to be received by the holders of our common stock, other than SAP or any affiliates of SAP, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger
Agreement, and Qatalyst Partners expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount, nature or timing of the compensation to any of our officers, directors or employees, or any
class of such persons, relative to the $36.00 per share cash consideration.

       The following is a brief summary of the material analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in connection with its opinion dated January 29, 2018. The analyses and factors described below
must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses or factors, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process
underlying Qatalyst Partners' opinion. For purposes of its analyses, Qatalyst Partners utilized both the consensus of third-party research analysts' projections ("Analyst Projections") and the
Company Projections. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully
understand the financial analyses used by Qatalyst Partners, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering the
full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Qatalyst Partners'
financial analyses.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

       Qatalyst Partners performed an illustrative discounted cash flow ("DCF") analysis, which is designed to imply a potential, present value of per share values for our common stock as of
December 31, 2017 by:

• adding:

       (a)  the implied net present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows of Callidus, based on the Company Projections, for calendar year 2018 through calendar
year 2022 (which implied present value was calculated by using a range of discount rates of 9.0% to 15.0%, based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital for
Callidus);

       (b)  the implied net present value of a corresponding terminal value of Callidus, calculated by multiplying the estimated unlevered free cash flow in calendar year 2023,
based on the Company Projections (assuming an effective tax rate of 17.5%, as provided by Callidus' management, and which tax rate excludes the effect of Callidus' estimated
remaining tax attributes for 2023, as such tax attributes were separately valued, as described in item (c) below), by a range of multiples of enterprise value to next-twelve-
months estimated unlevered free cash flow of 25.0x to 30.0x selected by Qatalyst based on its professional judgment, and discounted to present value using the same range of
discount rates used in item (a) above;

       (c)  the implied net present value of Callidus' forecasted tax attributes outstanding as of December 31, 2022 based on the Company Projections (which implied present
value was calculated by using the same range of discount rates used in item (a) above and the statutory tax rate applicable to us, as provided by Callidus' management); and

       (d)  the net cash of Callidus as of December 31, 2017, as estimated by Callidus' management;

• applying a dilution factor of approximately 12%, as projected by Callidus' management, to reflect the dilution to current stockholders over the projected period due to
the effect of future equity compensation grants; and 

• dividing the resulting amount by the number of fully-diluted shares of our common stock outstanding (calculated utilizing the treasury stock method), adjusted for
restricted stock units (including equity awards expected to be granted by Callidus in February 2018), performance stock units, and stock options outstanding as of
January 26, 2018, as well as shares of common stock expected to be purchased under the Callidus employee stock purchase plan in February 2018, all of which amounts
were provided by Callidus' management (the "Fully Diluted Shares").

Based on the calculations set forth above, this analysis implied a range of per share values of approximately $29.46 to $43.70.

Selected Companies Analysis

       Qatalyst Partners compared selected financial information and public market multiples for Callidus with publicly available information and public market multiples for selected companies.
The companies used in this comparison included those companies listed below, which were selected by Qatalyst Partners in its professional judgment, based on factors including that they are
publicly traded companies in similar lines of business to Callidus, having a similar business model, having similar financial performance, or having other relevant or similar characteristics.

       Based upon research analyst consensus estimates for calendar year 2018, and using the closing prices as of January 26, 2018 for shares of the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners
calculated, among other things, the implied fully-diluted enterprise value divided by the estimated consensus revenue for calendar year 2018 (the "CY2018E Revenue Multiples"), for each of
the selected companies.

       The CY2018E Revenue Multiple for Callidus was 7.0x based on the Analyst Projections and the fully-diluted enterprise value of Callidus was calculated using the closing price of Callidus
as of January 26, 2018.

       Based on an analysis of the CY2018E Revenue Multiples for each of the selected companies and the application of its professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative
range of 5.5x to 7.5x and applied this range to our estimated calendar year 2018 revenue based on each of the Company Projections and the Analyst Projections. Based on the Fully Diluted
Shares, this analysis implied a range of per share values for our common stock of approximately $26.63 to $35.54 based on the Company Projections and approximately $25.92 to $34.42
based on the Analyst Projections.

       No company included in the selected companies analysis is identical to Callidus. In evaluating the selected companies, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and assumptions with regard to
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond our control, such as the impact of competition on our
business and the industry in general, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in our financial condition and prospects or our industry or in the financial markets in
general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the arithmetic mean, median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data. In addition, certain
publicly available information and data that was used in the selected companies analysis might not, in whole or in part, reflect the impact of recent changes in U.S. tax laws.

the target company ("LTM Revenue Multiple"), and (b) the next-twelve months revenue of the target company ("NTM Revenue Multiple"), as reflected in certain publicly available financial
statements, research analyst reports and press releases.

       Based on an analysis of the LTM Revenue Multiple for each of the selected transactions, and the application of its professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range
of 5.5x to 12.6x and applied that range to our last-twelve months (ending September 30, 2017) revenue. Based on the Fully Diluted Shares, this analysis implied a range of per share values for
our common stock of approximately $21.25 to $45.43.

       Based on an analysis of the NTM Revenue Multiple for each of the selected transactions, and the application of its professional judgment, Qatalyst Partners selected a representative range
of 4.5x to 10.2x and applied that range to our next-twelve months (ending September 30, 2018) estimated revenue reflected in the Analyst Projections. Based on the Fully Diluted Shares, this
analysis implied a range of per share values for our common stock of approximately $20.75 to $43.84.

       No company or transaction utilized in the selected transactions analysis is identical to Callidus or the merger. In evaluating the selected transactions, Qatalyst Partners made judgments and
assumptions with regard to general business, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond our control, such as the impact of competition on our business or the
industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in our financial condition or the industry or in the financial markets in general, which could affect the public
trading value of the companies and the aggregate value of the transactions to which they are being compared. Because of the unique circumstances of each of these transactions and the merger,
Qatalyst Partners cautioned against placing undue reliance on this information.

Miscellaneous

       In connection with the review of the merger by our Board, Qatalyst Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The
preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Qatalyst Partners considered the
results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Qatalyst Partners believes that selecting any portion of its analyses,
without considering all analyses as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Qatalyst Partners may have given
various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the
ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Qatalyst Partners' view of the actual value of Callidus. In performing its analyses, Qatalyst
Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond our
control. Any estimates contained in Qatalyst Partners' analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by such estimates.

       Qatalyst Partners conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the $36.00 per share cash consideration to be
received by the holders of our common stock, other than SAP or any affiliates of SAP, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement, and in connection with the
delivery of its opinion to our Board. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the price at which our common stock might actually trade.

Table of Contents

in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement to our Board was one of many factors considered by our Board in deciding to approve the Merger Agreement. Consequently, the
analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of our Board with respect to the $36.00 per share cash consideration to be received by our stockholders
pursuant to the merger or of whether our Board would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. The $36.00 per share cash consideration was determined through arm's-length
negotiations between Callidus and SAP and was approved by our Board. Qatalyst Partners provided advice to Callidus during these negotiations. Qatalyst Partners did not, however,
recommend any specific consideration to Callidus or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.

       Qatalyst Partners provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may
arise. In the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst Partners may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity
securities or loans of Callidus, SAP or certain of their respective affiliates. During the two year period prior to the date of Qatalyst Partners' opinion, no material relationship existed between
Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates and Callidus or SAP pursuant to which compensation was received by Qatalyst Partners or its affiliates; however, Qatalyst Partners and/or its affiliates
may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to Callidus or SAP and their respective affiliates for which Qatalyst Partners or they would expect to receive
compensation.

       Under the terms of its engagement letter, Qatalyst Partners provided Callidus with financial advisory services in connection with the proposed merger for which it will be paid
approximately $32 million, $125,000 of which was payable upon the execution of such engagement letter and $2,000,000 of which was payable upon delivery of its opinion (regardless of the
conclusion reached in the opinion), and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, consummation of the merger. We have also agreed to reimburse Qatalyst Partners for
its expenses incurred in performing its services. We have also agreed to indemnify Qatalyst Partners and its affiliates, their respective members, directors, officers, partners, agents and
employees and any person controlling Qatalyst Partners or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under federal securities law, and certain expenses related to or
arising out of Qatalyst Partners' engagement.

Financial Projections

       Our management made available prospective financial information about Callidus ("Projections") for use in connection with the financial analyses performed by Qatalyst Partners in
connection with delivering its fairness opinion to our Board. Our management provided the same projections to Qatalyst Partners and our Board. A subset of this information, including
prospective financial information about the fourth quarter of our 2017 fiscal year, our 2018 fiscal year and our 2019 fiscal year, was delivered to SAP to assist with its due diligence review.

       These Projections did not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared, including the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or
the announcement thereof. Further, these Projections did not take into account the effect of any failure of the merger to occur, and should not be viewed as applicable or continuing in that
context.

       We do not as a matter of course make public projections as to future revenues, operating income or other results beyond the current fiscal year. The Projections are included in this proxy
statement only because (1) a subset of the Projections was made available to SAP in connection with the due diligence review of Callidus as described above; (2) the Projections were made
available to Qatalyst Partners for use in connection with its financial analysis as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "— Opinion of Callidus's Financial Advisor"

Projections were made available to our Board in connection with their consideration of a potential acquisition of Callidus and other strategic alternatives available to us. The information was
not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or GAAP, or the guidelines established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information. In the view of our management, the information was prepared on a reasonable basis,
reflected the best estimates and judgments available to our management at the time and presented, to the best of our management's knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and our
expected future financial performance as of the date such information was prepared. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future
results.

       Although the Projections are presented with numerical specificity, they reflect numerous estimates and assumptions made by us with respect to industry performance, general business,
economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to our business, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many
of which are beyond our control. The Projections reflect subjective judgment in many respects and thus are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual
experience and business developments. As such, the Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially from the results forecasted in the Projections, including, but not limited to, our performance, industry performance, general business and economic conditions, customer
requirements, staffing levels, competition, adverse changes in applicable laws, regulations or rules, and the various risks set forth in our reports filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance
that the Projections will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than forecast. The Projections cover several years and such information by its nature becomes
less reliable with each successive year. In addition, the Projections will be affected by our ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. The Projections
reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. The Projections cannot, therefore, be considered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information
should not be relied on as such. The inclusion of the Projections should not be regarded as an indication that we and our financial advisors or anyone who received this information then
considered, or now considers, them a reliable prediction of future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. The inclusion of the Projections herein should not be deemed
an admission or representation by us that we view such Projections as material information; in fact we view the Projections as non-material because of the inherent risks and uncertainties
associated with such long-range forecasts. The inclusion of the Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that the Projections will be necessarily predictive of
actual future events. No representation is made by us or any other person regarding the Projections or our ultimate performance compared to such information. The Projections should be
evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information about us contained in our public filings with the SEC. See "Where You Can Find Additional
Information" on page 95 of this proxy statement. In light of the foregoing factors, and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections, stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any,
reliance on the Projections.

       Neither our independent auditor nor any other independent accountant has compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the Projections, nor have they expressed any
opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.

       Some of the Projections are "non-GAAP financial measures," which are financial performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-GAAP
financial measures used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures, because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be
included in a GAAP presentation. Accordingly, these

non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not as an alternative to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The summary of such information
below is included solely to give stockholders access to the information that was made available to Qatalyst Partners, SAP and our Board, and is not included in this proxy statement in order to
influence any stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the merger, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to the shares of our common stock.

       The following table presents selected unaudited financial information for the fiscal years ending 2017 through 2023:

       In addition, the Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date they were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement, and except as
required by applicable securities laws, Callidus does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date
when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error.

Financing of the Merger 

       We estimate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the merger and related transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is approximately $2.4 billion. SAP intends to
obtain such funds by means of a capital contribution and/or a loan from SAP SE or another affiliate. SAP SE intends to fund such amounts through cash on hand and may elect to utilize the
proceeds of a new term loan or bond financing. The merger is not subject to a financing condition. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, SAP SE has absolutely, irrevocably and
unconditionally guaranteed the payment and performance of SAP's and Merger Sub's obligations under the Merger Agreement.

Interests of Callidus Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

       When considering the recommendation of our Board, you should be aware that our Board members and executive officers have interests in the merger in addition to their interests as
Callidus stockholders generally. These interests are described below and may be different from, or in conflict with, your interests as a Callidus stockholder. Our Board members were aware of
the material facts as to these additional interests, and considered them, among other matters, when they approved the Merger Agreement.

Overview

       A description of the interests of our directors and executive officers, including interests in equity-based awards and other compensation and benefit arrangements, is set forth below. The
dates used to quantify these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes only, and do not necessarily reflect the dates on which certain events will or may occur.

acquisition-related costs and other non-recurring expenses.
(3) Using the information set forth in the Projections, Qatalyst Partners calculated Unlevered Free Cash Flow for fiscal years 2018 through 2023, which calculations were approved by Callidus for Qatalyst

Partners' use. Unlevered Free Cash Flow is calculated as Non-GAAP Operating Income less (i) cash taxes, less (ii) capital expenditures, plus (iii) depreciation, less (iv) investment in working capital. The
Unlevered Free Cash Flow in terminal year 2023 assumes an effective tax rate of 17.5%.

Interests of Non-Employee Directors

       The general treatment of stock options and restricted stock units ("RSUs") in the merger, including such awards held by our non-employee directors, is described below under "The Merger
Agreement — The Merger — Treatment of Outstanding Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units" beginning on page 63 of this proxy statement.

       Under the terms of their existing change of control agreements, outstanding unvested RSUs held by our non-employee directors will become fully vested upon a "change of control" as
defined in the applicable change of control agreements, which includes the merger. As of February 15, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, there were no unvested stock options held
by our non-employee directors. The Merger Agreement provides that stock options, including stock options held by each of our non-employee directors, will be cashed out in an amount equal
to (i) the excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration of $36.00 over the applicable exercise price per share of such stock options multiplied by (ii) the number of shares subject to each
such stock option (without interest and less any withholding taxes required by applicable law). The Merger Agreement also provides that RSUs held by each of our non-employee directors will
be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the per share merger consideration of $36.00 multiplied by the number of shares subject to such RSUs (without interest and less any
withholding taxes required by applicable law).

       The following table summarizes, as of February 15, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, the outstanding stock options held by each of our non-employee directors (all of which
are vested), the weighted-average exercise price of such stock options, the number of unvested RSUs and vested but unreleased RSUs, and the consideration that each of them will become
entitled to upon closing of the merger pursuant to the terms of their outstanding equity awards.

(1) All currently outstanding unvested RSUs and vested but unreleased RSUs held by non-employee directors will accelerate in connection with the consummation of the merger, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
(2) The dollar value of stock options is calculated by multiplying (i) the number of shares subject to the stock options by (ii) the excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration of $36.00 over the per-share exercise price of each

stock option. The dollar value of RSUs is calculated by multiplying the number of shares subject to the RSUs by the per share merger consideration of $36.00.

Interests of Executive Officers

       Our current executive officers are Leslie J. Stretch (our Chief Executive Officer), Roxanne Oulman (our Chief Financial Officer) and Jimmy Duan (our Chief Technology Officer). These
executive officers are also our named executive officers ("NEOs") in the proxy statement for our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders ("2017 Proxy Statement"). We described the 2016
compensation for our NEOs in our 2017 Proxy Statement.

       The general treatment of stock options, RSUs and performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs") in the merger, including such awards held by our NEOs, is described below under

Agreement — The Merger — Treatment of Outstanding Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units" beginning on page 63 of this proxy statement.

Stock Options and RSUs

       We have granted stock options and RSUs to our NEOs that remain outstanding. As of February 15, 2018, all stock options held by our NEOs had already vested. The following table
summarizes, as of February 15, 2018, the record date for the special meeting, the outstanding vested stock options held by each of our NEOs, the weighted-average exercise price of those
stock options, the number of unvested RSUs, and the consideration that each of them will become entitled to in connection with the closing of the merger pursuant to the terms of their
outstanding equity awards.

(1) Each stock option held by our executive officers will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash consideration as set forth in footnote 3 below.
(2) Each of the RSUs held by our executive officers granted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement that remains outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be cancelled in exchange

for the unvested right to receive the per share merger consideration of $36.00 in respect of each underlying share of our common stock, less applicable withholding. The right will vest and become payable in accordance with the
vesting schedule and subject to such other terms and conditions as applicable to the RSU immediately prior to the effective date of the merger. However, RSUs granted after the date of the Merger Agreement, dated January 29,
2018, will be converted at an exchange ratio, determined based on SAP SE's trading price at the effective time of the merger, into restricted stock units denominated in shares of SAP SE. Such RSUs will be subject to the time and
service-based vesting and other terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of the merger.

(3) The dollar value of stock options is calculated by multiplying the number of shares subject to the stock options by the excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration of $36.00 over the per share exercise price of the stock
options. The dollar value of RSUs is calculated by multiplying the number of shares subject to the RSUs by the per share merger consideration of $36.00.

PSUs

       We granted PSUs to our NEOs in fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017 that currently remain outstanding. The PSUs granted in fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017 each (i) have a three-fiscal-
year performance period, (ii) are subject to the achievement of threshold and target performance metrics, (iii) provide for the opportunity to earn between 0% and 200% of the target number of
shares subject to the PSU depending on actual achievement, calculated based on linear interpolation, and (iv) generally vest subject to continued service over the performance period.

       In connection with the proposed merger, in order to clarify how the performance goals will be measured at the effective time of the merger for purposes of determining pay-out levels, we
have entered into a letter agreement ("PSU Letter Agreement") with each of our NEOs crediting each NEO with a number of PSUs deemed to be earned based on actual performance levels
through December 31, 2017, except that uncompleted performance periods for PSUs granted in 2017 will be deemed to be earned at 100% of target, resulting in assumed 92% achievement for
the full performance cycle. Each PSU Letter Agreement provides that (1) the PSUs held by such executive officer will be deemed earned and credited with the number of shares set forth
below; (2) each PSU held by such executive officer will convert into a right to receive the per share merger consideration of $36.00 for each share that is deemed earned and credited and will
remain subject to service-based vesting through the applicable performance period end date set forth below; and (3) any PSUs held by such executive officer that are not credited as described

below will be forfeited at the effective time of the merger for no consideration. Each PSU Letter Agreement will be null, void and have no force or effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated
and the proposed merger does not occur.

(1) This column sets forth the number of shares deemed earned and credited pursuant to the PSU Letter Agreements, described above, assuming the completion of the merger, representing 175% of target levels for the 2015 PSUs,
156% of target levels for the 2016 PSUs and 92% of target levels for the 2017 PSUs.

(2) The dollar value of the shares credited is calculated by multiplying the number of shares credited by the per-share merger consideration of $36.00.

Existing Severance Arrangements with Callidus

       Callidus's severance arrangement with Mr. Stretch provides that if he is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason, he will receive a lump sum severance payment equal to
18 months of his base salary, target bonus, and cost of COBRA health benefits contributions. Callidus's severance arrangement with Ms. Oulman provides that if she is terminated without
cause or resigns for good reason, she will receive a lump sum severance payment equal to 12 months of her base salary, target bonus, and cost of COBRA health benefits contributions.
Callidus's severance arrangement with Mr. Duan provides that if he is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason, he will receive a lump sum severance payment equal to nine months
of his base salary, target bonus, and cost of COBRA health benefits contributions. The severance amounts our NEOs are entitled to in the event that they are terminated without cause or resign
for good reason are set forth below in the section below entitled "— Potential Payments in Connection with a Change of Control." In each case, the named executive officer would be required
to timely execute a general release of claims prior to receiving the severance payments.

       In addition, if such qualifying termination without cause or for good reason occurs within 18 months after a change of control, including the completion of the merger, 100% of the NEOs'
existing awards of options, RSUs and PSUs would immediately vest and become payable, as applicable.

       For purposes of the severance arrangements with each of our named executive officers as described above, the term "cause" generally means the occurrence of any one or more of the
following (provided that, in the case of the first three events, the executive has been provided with 30 days after written notice from us to cure such action unless not reasonably susceptible to
cure): (1) any material act of misconduct or dishonesty by the executive in the performance of his or her duties; (2) any willful or material failure by the executive to perform his or her duties;
(3) any material breach of any employment agreement, confidentiality agreement or proprietary information agreement; or (4) the executive's conviction of (or pleading guilty or nolo
contendere to) a misdemeanor involving theft, embezzlement, dishonesty or moral turpitude, or a felony.

       For purposes of the severance arrangements with each of our named executive officers as described above, the term "good reason" generally means with respect to each such executive:
(1) any reduction in his or her base salary or annual target bonus; (2) any material reduction in other benefits applicable to such executive; (3) any material reduction in his or her duties,
responsibilities or authority; or (4) a

Arrangements between Our Executive Officers and SAP

       There are no employment agreements, retention arrangements, or other contractual rights between SAP and any of our NEOs as of February 15, 2018.

Potential Payments in Connection with a Change of Control

       The table below sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding payments and benefits that each of our NEOs would receive in connection with the merger
assuming that the merger is consummated on February 15, 2018 and each of our NEOs experiences a qualifying termination immediately after the effective date of the merger. The amounts
below were determined based on the per share merger consideration of $36.00 and the outstanding equity awards held by each named executive officer as of February 15, 2018 (with no further
vesting of such equity awards between February 15, 2018 and the consummation of the merger). Because the amounts below are based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by the NEOs may materially differ from the amounts set forth below. This compensation is referred to as "golden parachute" compensation by
the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section such term is used to describe the compensation payable to our NEOs as it relates to the merger. The "golden parachute" compensation
payable to these individuals is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of our stockholders.

       To the extent that the payments and benefits shown below constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
("Code") and would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the payments and benefits will be payable either (i) in full, or (ii) as to such lesser amount which
would result in no portion of such compensation being subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, whichever of the foregoing amounts (taking into consideration applicable
taxes, including the excise tax under Section 4999) would result in the receipt by such NEO on an after-tax basis of the greatest amount of benefits (even if some of such benefits are taxable
under Section 4999). The amounts set forth below do not take into effect any possible reduction due to the application of Section 280G of the Code as set forth above. No NEO is entitled to tax
gross ups on these payments and benefits.

applicable agreements) as described above in the section entitled " — Existing Severance Arrangements with Callidus." Amounts for Mr. Stretch reflect 18 months' base salary of $525,000 and a target
bonus of $525,000. Amounts for Ms. Oulman reflect 12 months' base salary of $367,500 and a target bonus of $238,875. Amounts for Mr. Duan reflect nine months' base salary of $363,825 and a target
bonus of $272,869. Such amounts would be payable upon a qualifying termination of the NEO whether or not the merger is completed.

(2) The amounts included reflect the acceleration of any outstanding unvested stock options, RSUs and PSUs, to which each of the NEOs would be entitled upon any qualifying "double-trigger" termination (a
qualifying termination that occurs within 18 months following the merger). As of the record date, none of our NEOs hold unvested stock options. Amounts reflected exclude the value of previously vested
options held by NEOs which will be cancelled in exchange for cash payment as described in the section entitled "— Interests of Executive Officers." The dollar value of unvested RSUs and

Indemnification and Insurance

       For a period of six years from and after the effective time of the merger, Callidus as the surviving corporation, will (and SAP will cause the surviving corporation to) indemnify and hold
harmless all of our and our subsidiaries' past and present directors, officers and employees to the same extent such persons were indemnified as of the date of the Merger Agreement by us
pursuant to applicable law, our and our subsidiaries' certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and specified indemnification agreements in existence on the date of the Merger Agreement,
arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as our and our subsidiaries' directors, officers or employees occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger. The surviving corporation
will (and SAP will cause the surviving corporation to) advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any actions with respect to the matters
subject to indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence in accordance with the procedures set forth in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and indemnification agreements, if any,
in existence on the date of the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that any of our and our subsidiaries' directors, officers or employees to whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to the
extent required by the DGCL or by the applicable indemnification agreement or organizational document, to repay such advanced expenses to the surviving corporation if it is ultimately
determined that such director, officer or employee is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law or pursuant to the applicable indemnification agreement or organization document.

       We have entered into indemnity agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. Each indemnity agreement provides that we will indemnify the director or officer to the
fullest extent permitted by law, including, without limitation, for all expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and settlement amounts paid or incurred by them in any action, suit
or proceeding on account of their services as our directors, officers, employees or agents or in similar capacities at our request. We are obligated pursuant to such agreements to indemnify or
advance expenses to an indemnified party, except with respect to certain proceedings or claims. A director or executive officer must reimburse us for expenses advanced only to the extent it is
ultimately determined that the director or executive officer is not entitled, under Delaware law, our bylaws, his or her indemnity agreement or otherwise to be indemnified for such expenses.

       In the event the surviving corporation or any of our subsidiaries consolidate with or merge into another entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to another entity, then proper provision will be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of
such assets, as the case may be, assumes the obligations described above (without relieving SAP of the obligations described above).

       Prior to the effective time of the merger, we will obtain a directors and officers runoff insurance policy, or "tail" insurance policy, with a claims period of six years from the effective time
of the merger with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who were, as of the date of the Merger Agreement, covered by our directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy, for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the merger, on terms that are no less favorable than our policies in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement.
Neither we nor the surviving corporation will be required to pay an annual premium for such tail policy in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid prior the date of the Merger
Agreement.

Appraisal Rights

       If the merger is consummated, Callidus stockholders who do not vote in favor of the merger proposal, who properly demand appraisal of their shares before the vote on the merger
proposal at the special meeting, who continuously hold their shares through the effective time of the merger and who otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL
("Section 262") (including with respect to certain aggregate ownership requirements describe below) will, subject to the conditions thereof, be entitled to have their shares appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the "fair value" of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be the fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery in connection with the
merger under Section 262. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262 and in this summary to a "stockholder" are to a record holder of common stock.

       The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that Callidus stockholders
exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in such holder's name. A
person or entity having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the
record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or
other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee.

       Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders of a corporation, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting,
must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Callidus's
notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the
merger, any holder of shares of common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder's right to do so, should review Annex C carefully. Failure to
strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A Callidus stockholder who loses his, her or its
appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration described in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek
appraisal of shares

of common stock, Callidus believes that if a Callidus stockholder is considering exercising such rights, such stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

       Callidus stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the following:

• the stockholder must not vote in favor of or consent to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; 

• the stockholder must deliver to Callidus a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting; 

• the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a Callidus stockholder will lose
appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the effective time of the merger); and 

• a stockholder or the surviving company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days
after the effective time of the merger. The surviving company is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.

       Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Agreement, a Callidus stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote its shares.

       CALLIDUS STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES WITH A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL
RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR
THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF SUCH SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN
SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE
RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

       All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Callidus Software Inc.
4140 Dublin Boulevard, Suite 400

Dublin, California 94568
Attention: General Counsel

       Any holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to Callidus
a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require written
approval of the surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court
of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this will not affect the right of any Callidus
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the merger
consideration within 60 days after the effective time of the merger.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation

       If the merger is completed, within ten days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify each holder of shares of common stock who has made a written
demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective
date thereof.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

       Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is
entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in
the case of a petition filed by a Callidus stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all Callidus stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation
is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to
the fair value of the shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their
appraisal rights in respect of their shares of common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of Callidus common stock to file such a petition
within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder's previous written demand for appraisal.

       Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon
written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect
to which Callidus has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder
within ten days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A
beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the surviving
corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a Callidus stockholder of record.

       If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation will then be
obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all Callidus stockholders who have
demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware
Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those Callidus stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal
rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the Callidus stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery
for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to
such stockholder.

       The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Callidus stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal
exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 or (b) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares
exceeds $1 million (the "ownership thresholds").

Determination of Fair Value

       After determining the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, and that at least one of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the Callidus stockholders
seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.
Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the "fair value" of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into
account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the
judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the
effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery's entry of
judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each Callidus stockholder seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to
subsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment
and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (ii) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v.
UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or
methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered, and that "[f]air price obviously requires consideration
of all relevant factors involving the value of a company." The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc.,
the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements
of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise,
which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered."

       Callidus stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as
or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a
financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262. Although Callidus believes that the
merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and Callidus stockholders
should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration. Neither Callidus nor SAP anticipate
offering more than the merger consideration to any Callidus stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Callidus and SAP reserves the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant
to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the "fair value" of a share of common stock is less than the per share merger
consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the Callidus stockholders seeking appraisal rights,
then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys' fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined

by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a Callidus stockholder, the
Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any Callidus stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.

       From and after the effective time of the merger, no Callidus stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of common stock for any purpose or to
receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder's shares of common stock, if any, payable to Callidus stockholders as of a
time prior to the effective time of the merger. If no petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in
respect of the Callidus stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of
the merger, either within 60 days after the effective time of the merger or thereafter with the written approval of the surviving corporation, then the right of such Callidus stockholder to an
appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any Callidus stockholder who
commenced the proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval of the court.

       Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a Callidus stockholder's statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any Callidus
stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

Delisting and Deregistration of Callidus Common Stock

       If the merger is completed, our common stock will be delisted from and will no longer be traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act. Following
the closing of the merger, we will no longer be an independent public company.

Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

       The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of Callidus common stock. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the
Code, the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial and administrative rulings, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change
or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such changes could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein.

       This discussion assumes that holders of Callidus common stock hold their shares as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment).
This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of Callidus common stock in light of such holder's particular circumstances, nor
does it discuss the special considerations applicable to holders of our common stock subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as, for example, financial
institutions or broker-dealers, mutual funds, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market
method of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, former citizens or residents of the United States, holders who acquired their Callidus common
stock through the exercise of options or otherwise as compensation, holders who hold their Callidus common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction,
holders who acquired Callidus common stock through a 401(k), deferred compensation plan or retirement plan, U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S.
dollar, non-U.S. holders who own, actually or constructively, more than 5% of Callidus's common stock, and holders who exercise appraisal rights. This discussion does not address any aspect
of non-U.S., state, local, alternative minimum, estate, gift or other tax law that may be applicable to a holder.

Table of Contents

       This discussion provides only a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of Callidus common stock. It is not a complete analysis or
description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. The U.S. federal income tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretation. Accordingly, the Internal
Revenue Service may not agree with the tax consequences described in this proxy statement. No ruling has been or will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service as to the tax consequences
of the merger.

       All holders should consult their own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to them (including the application and effect of any state, local or non-U.S. income
and other tax laws or tax treaties) of the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Callidus common stock pursuant to the merger.

       For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of Callidus common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• an individual citizen or individual resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

• a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 

• a trust if (i) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or 

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

       A "non-U.S. holder" is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or other entity classified as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes) of Callidus common stock that is not a U.S. holder.

       If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Callidus common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will
depend on the status of the partner and activities of the partnership. Partners holding Callidus common stock and partners in such partnerships should consult their own tax advisors.

U.S. Holders

       The conversion of shares of Callidus common stock into cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder generally will
recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the merger and such U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis
in the shares that are converted into cash pursuant to the merger. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder's holding period
for such shares exceeds one year as of the date of the merger. Long-term capital gains for certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income
tax at a maximum rate of 20%. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Callidus common stock at different times or different
prices, such U.S. holder must determine its tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss separately with respect to each block of Callidus common stock.

       U.S. holders who are individuals will be subject to the Medicare net investment income tax of 3.8%, if they have "net investment income" and have modified adjusted gross income that is
greater than $250,000 for taxpayers filing a joint return or as a surviving spouse, $125,000 for married taxpayers filing separately and $200,000 for other taxpayers. This tax is in addition to
any income taxes also imposed on such gain.

Table of Contents

"Net investment income" generally will include gain from the disposition of Callidus common stock in the merger.

Non-U.S. Holders

       Any gain recognized on the receipt of cash pursuant to the merger by a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

• the gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is also attributable to a
permanent establishment or, in certain cases involving individuals, a fixed base in the United States maintained by such non-U.S. holder), in which case the non-U.S.
holder generally will be subject to tax on such gain in the same manner as a U.S. holder and, if the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, such corporation may also
be subject to branch profits tax at the rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty); 

• the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and certain other
conditions are met, in which case the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to a 30% flat rate tax (unless reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty)
on the non-U.S. holder's net gain realized in the merger, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder recognized in the same taxable year, if
any; or 

• the non-U.S. holder owned, directly or under certain constructive ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of Callidus common stock at any time during the five-year
period preceding the merger, and Callidus is or has been a "U.S. real property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code at any time
during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held Callidus common stock, in which case gain recognized by
such non-U.S. holder will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates and payments made to such non-U.S. holder in exchange for shares of
Callidus common stock pursuant to the merger will be subject to U.S. withholding at a rate of 15% of the amount realized in the disposition. Callidus believes that it has
not been a "U.S. real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

       Payments made in exchange for shares of Callidus common stock generally will be subject to information reporting unless the holder is an "exempt recipient" and may also be subject to
backup withholding at a rate of 24% unless the holder properly establishes an exemption, certifies under penalties of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder (and the payer does not have actual
knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a U.S. person as defined under the Code), or provides its correct tax identification number and otherwise complies with the applicable
requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against
a holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.

       HSR Act.    The closing of the merger is subject to expiration or earlier termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as
amended ("HSR Act") and the rules thereunder. Under the HSR Act and the rules thereunder, the merger may not be completed unless certain information has been furnished to the Antitrust
Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and to the Federal Trade Commission and the applicable waiting period expires or is terminated. The HSR Act requires the parties to observe a 30-
day waiting period ("initial 30-day waiting period"), during which time the merger may not be consummated, unless that initial 30-day waiting period is terminated early. If, before the
expiration of the initial 30-day waiting period, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission issues a request for additional information (a "Second
Request"), the parties may not consummate the transaction until 30 days after Callidus and SAP have each substantially complied with such request for additional information (unless this
period is shortened pursuant to a grant of earlier termination or extended by agreement between the parties and the relevant antitrust agency). On February 12, 2018, Callidus and SAP filed
their respective notification and report forms pursuant to the HSR Act with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. On February 22, 2018,
the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission terminated the waiting period under the HSR Act.

       At any time before or after the effective time of the merger, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general or private
parties can file suit under the antitrust laws to enjoin consummation of the merger, to impose conditions on the merger, or to require divestitures. There can be no assurance that the merger will
not be challenged on antitrust grounds or, if such a challenge is made, that the challenge will not be successful.

       German Antitrust Laws.    The Act against Restraints of Competition requires SAP and Callidus to file a notification with the Federal Cartel Office ("FCO") and provides that the merger
shall not occur until a one-month waiting period, or in case of an in-depth investigation, a waiting period of four months, from submission of a complete notification to the FCO has expired or
otherwise been terminated. The parties filed such notification with the FCO in connection with the merger on February 14, 2018.

       Austrian Antitrust Laws.    Under the Austrian Cartel Act, the merger may not be completed until the expiration of a four-week waiting period following the filing of a notification with the
Austrian Federal Competition Authority ("FCA"), unless the waiting period is terminated early. The parties filed such notification with the FCA in connection with the merger on February 15,
2018. Under the Cartel Act, the required four-week waiting period will expire if neither the FCA nor the Federal Cartel Prosecutor has lodged an appeal for "Phase II" proceedings within such
four-week period. If a Phase II proceeding is undertaken, the waiting period with respect to the merger would be extended for an additional period of up to five months.

       Cyprus Antitrust Laws.    The Control of Concentrations Between Undertakings Law No. 83(I) of 2014 (Concentrations Law) requires SAP and Callidus to file a notification with the
Commission of the Protection of Competition ("CPC") and provides that the merger shall not occur until a one-month waiting period (which the CPC may extend for an additional fourteen
days), or in case of an in-depth investigation, a waiting period of four months, from submission of a complete notification to the CPC has expired or otherwise been terminated. The parties
filed such notification with the CPC in connection with the merger on February 15, 2018.

Table of Contents

       Based on a review of the information currently available relating to the countries and businesses in which SAP and Callidus are engaged, SAP and Callidus believe that no other
mandatory antitrust premerger notification filing is required. Further, based upon an examination of publicly available and other information relating to the businesses in which Callidus is
engaged, SAP and Callidus believe that the merger should not violate applicable antitrust laws. Nevertheless, SAP and Callidus cannot be certain that a challenge to the merger on antitrust
grounds will not be made, or, if such challenge is made, what the result will be.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

       The following summary describes certain material provisions of the Merger Agreement. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of
the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We urge you to read carefully the Merger Agreement in
its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you.

       The Merger Agreement and the following description have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and is not intended to modify or
supplement any factual disclosures about Callidus, SAP or Merger Sub in Callidus's or SAP SE's public reports filed with the SEC. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy
statement and in the other public filings Callidus and SAP SE make with the SEC, which are available, without charge, at www.sec.gov.

       In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of
specified dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, and are subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties to the Merger Agreement, including being qualified
by confidential disclosure schedules provided by Callidus to SAP and Merger Sub in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement. These disclosure schedules contain information
that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the
Merger Agreement have been made for the purposes of allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing matters of fact. Accordingly, the representations and
warranties in the Merger Agreement may not constitute the actual state of facts about Callidus, SAP or Merger Sub. The representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the Merger
Agreement may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable under federal securities laws or from what may be viewed as material to
stockholders. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, or covenants or any descriptions thereof as
characterizations of the actual state of facts or the actual condition of Callidus, SAP or Merger Sub, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the
subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in our public
disclosures. The Merger Agreement is described in this proxy statement and included as Annex A only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide
any other factual information regarding Callidus, SAP or Merger Sub, or their respective businesses.

The Merger

       Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with Delaware law, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAP and
a party to the Merger Agreement, will merge with and into Callidus; Callidus will survive the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAP and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
will cease.

Effective Time; Closing

       The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date and time as may be agreed upon by the
parties and specified in the certificate of merger. The filing of the certificate of merger will occur on the date of closing, which will take place on a date to be specified by the parties and which
will be no later than the third day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in New York, New York, San Francisco, California, London, United Kingdom or
Frankfurt am Main, Germany are authorized or required by law to be closed after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the closing of the merger set forth in the

Merger Agreement and described in this proxy statement, or at such other time as is agreed to between the parties. Although we expect to complete the merger as soon as possible following the
special meeting of our stockholders (if our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement) and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the closing of the merger set forth in the Merger
Agreement, we cannot specify when or assure that Callidus and SAP will satisfy or waive all of the conditions to the closing of the merger. See "— Conditions to the Closing of the Merger"
beginning on page 83 of this proxy statement.

Treatment of Outstanding Common Stock

       The Merger Agreement provides that each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted at the effective time of the
merger into the right to receive $36.00 in cash, without interest and less any withholding taxes required by applicable law, except that shares held by Callidus as treasury stock or by any of our
subsidiaries or by SAP or any of its subsidiaries will be cancelled and no payment will be made with respect to those shares, and shares held by stockholders who properly demand their
appraisal rights under Delaware law with respect to any such shares will be treated as described under "The Merger — Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 53 of this proxy statement.

Treatment of Outstanding Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units

       Stock Options.    Each stock option (whether vested or unvested) that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding at the effective time of the merger, without any further action of the parties
or the optionholder, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares subject to such stock option and
(ii) the excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration of $36.00 over the applicable per share exercise price of such stock option (without interest and less any withholding taxes required
by applicable law).

       Vested RSUs and PSUs.    Each time-based restricted stock unit ("RSU") or performance-based restricted stock unit ("PSU") that is vested (but not released or otherwise settled) at the
effective time of the merger will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive the per share merger consideration of $36.00 for each share of our common stock underlying such RSU or
PSU (without interest and less any withholding taxes required by applicable law).

       Unvested RSUs.    Each RSU granted prior to January 29, 2018, the Merger Agreement date (other than RSUs held by our non-employee directors) that remains outstanding immediately
prior to, and is not vested immediately prior to, the effective time of the merger will be cancelled in exchange for the unvested right to receive in cash the per share merger consideration of
$36.00 for each share of our common stock underlying such RSU (without interest and less any withholding taxes required by applicable law), with such right to vest and become payable on
the date upon which each such corresponding RSU would have vested under the time-based vesting terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreement or change of control
agreement governing such RSU. If such terms and conditions are not satisfied and such right does not otherwise vest pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement or change of
control agreement, no cash payment will be made with respect to such RSU.

       Unvested 2018 RSUs.    Each RSU granted on or after January 29, 2018 (the "2018 RSUs") will be converted into a cash-settled restricted stock unit denominated in shares of SAP SE,
pursuant to an exchange ratio determined based on SAP SE's average trading price over the five days immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and will remain subject to the time-
based vesting terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreement governing such 2018 RSU. Upon a given vesting date, the payment amount for the portion of each such 2018
RSU that vests will be determined based on SAP SE's average trading price over the five days immediately prior to the date upon which such portion would have

Table of Contents

vested under the time-based vesting terms and conditions set forth in the award agreement governing such 2018 RSU. Each such cash payment will be paid in the next practical payroll run
after the applicable vesting date set forth in the award agreement governing such 2018 RSU, but not later than the month following such vesting date.

       Unvested PSUs.    Each PSU that remains outstanding immediately prior to, and is not vested immediately prior to, the effective time of the merger will be (i) deemed earned and credited
for performance, as described in the section entitled "The Merger — Interests of Callidus Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Interests of Executive Officers" beginning on
page 48 of this proxy statement, with respect to any uncompleted performance period as of the date of the Merger Agreement and (ii) cancelled in exchange for the unvested right to receive in
cash the per share merger consideration of $36.00 for each share of our common stock underlying such PSU (after giving effect to the foregoing crediting of performance metrics), without
interest and less any withholding taxes required by applicable law, with such payment to vest and become payable on the date upon which each such PSU would have vested under the time-
based vesting terms and conditions applicable to such PSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and at the pay-out levels set forth in the Merger Agreement (which were
determined based on actual performance levels through 2017, except that uncompleted performance periods for PSUs granted in 2017 will be deemed to be earned at 100% of target, resulting
in assumed 92% achievement for the full performance cycle). If such terms and conditions are not satisfied and such right does not otherwise vest pursuant to the terms of the applicable
change of control agreement, no cash payment will be made with respect to such PSU.

       Unvested RSUs Held by Non-Employee Directors.    Each RSU held by our non-employee directors that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, whether
vested or unvested, will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the per share merger consideration of $36.00 for each share of our common stock underlying such RSU (without
interest), to be paid in cash in a single lump sum payment as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 30 days) following the effective time of the merger.

       Prior to the completion of the merger, we will take all actions necessary, and adopt all resolutions necessary, to effectuate the foregoing actions relating to outstanding stock options, RSUs
and PSUs, including, without limitation, adopting resolutions that prohibit the granting of new awards under any of our equity plans effective as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger.

Treatment of Purchase Rights under Employee Stock Purchase Plan

       Each current offering period in progress as of the date of the Merger Agreement under our Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") will continue after the date of
the Merger Agreement and shares will be issued to participants thereunder on the next currently scheduled purchase dates that occur after the date of the Merger Agreement (subject to the
terms and conditions of the ESPP). However, any offering period in progress as of the effective time of the merger will be shortened, and the last day of each such offering period will be two
business days before the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs and each then outstanding purchase right under the ESPP will be exercised automatically on the second business
day prior to the effective time of the merger. No new offering period will commence under the ESPP at or after the date of the Merger Agreement, except following a valid termination of the
Merger Agreement. Each purchased share under the ESPP will be converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive in cash the per share merger consideration of $36.00,
without interest and less any withholding taxes required by applicable law. As of or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, we will terminate the ESPP. We will also take any
actions necessary, and adopt all resolutions necessary, to give effect to the foregoing transactions.

Surrender of Stock Certificates; Payment of Merger Consideration; Lost Certificates

       Prior to the effective time of the merger, SAP or Merger Sub will designate a paying agent and, from time to time after the effective time of the merger, SAP will deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the paying agent funds in amounts and at times necessary to pay the merger consideration to which former holders of our common stock will be entitled at the effective time of
the merger (other than shares held by stockholders who properly demand appraisal rights with respect to any such shares and shares subject to unvested RSUs or PSUs). Promptly after the
effective time of the merger, SAP will cause Callidus to make available funds, or deposit funds with Callidus, in amounts and at times necessary to pay the consideration to which former
holders of options, RSUs and PSUs would be entitled at the effective time and thereafter.

       As promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger, the paying agent will mail to each person who was a holder of record of a certificate or certificates representing shares of
our common stock or shares held in book-entry with our transfer agent immediately prior to the effective time of the merger a letter of transmittal containing instructions for surrendering
certificates or book-entry shares formerly representing such shares of our common stock in exchange for merger consideration. After the effective time of the merger, each holder of a
certificate or book-entry shares previously representing such shares of our common stock will, upon surrender to the paying agent of a certificate (if such shares are certificated) and/or a
properly completed letter of transmittal in accordance with the instructions thereto, be entitled to receive the merger consideration of $36.00 in cash, without interest and less any withholding
taxes required by applicable law, for each share of our common stock formerly represented by such certificate or book-entry shares. Each certificate or book-entry share so surrendered will be
cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by the terms of the Merger Agreement, each certificate or book-entry share formerly representing such shares of our common stock will be
deemed at any time after the effective time to represent only the right to receive the merger consideration in cash as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, without interest.

       The cash paid upon surrender of any such certificate or book-entry shares will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of our common stock
formerly represented by such certificate or book-entry shares. At the effective time of the merger, our stock transfer books will be closed and we will not register transfers of shares on our
records.

       SAP, Merger Sub and Callidus (as the surviving entity) and the paying agent will have the right to deduct and withhold from the merger consideration such amounts as such parties are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to making such payment in accordance with applicable rules and regulations, including the Code, including any stock transfer taxes.

       If any such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the paying agent will pay the merger consideration with respect to each share of our common stock formerly represented by such
certificate upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by SAP, the posting by such person of a bond in an
amount as SAP may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the parties to the merger with respect to such certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

       At any time following the six-month anniversary of the closing date of the merger, the surviving corporation may require the paying agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
paid thereon) previously made available to the paying agent that have not been disbursed to holders of certificates or book-entry shares formerly representing shares of our common stock.
After that point, stockholders will no longer be able to receive the merger consideration from the paying agent. Instead, they will be required to seek to obtain the merger consideration from
only the surviving corporation and in so doing will be treated as general creditors with respect to the payment of any such merger consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding
taxes required by applicable law.

Directors and Officers

       The Merger Agreement provides that Merger Sub's directors and Callidus's officers immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will, from and after the effective time of the
merger, be the initial directors and continue as the officers, respectively, of the surviving corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
surviving corporation until his or her respective successors have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or his or her earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate

       Some of our representations and warranties are qualified by a material adverse effect standard. The Merger Agreement provides that a material adverse effect is any change, event,
development, occurrence, state of facts, circumstance or effect that:

• is, or would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate with all other effects, materially adverse to the business, financial condition, assets or results
of operations of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or 

• prevents, or would reasonably be expected to prevent, consummation of the merger or our performance of any of our material obligations under the Merger Agreement.

       For purposes of the first bullet point above, the Merger Agreement provides that none of the following will constitute or be taken into account in determining whether there has been or
reasonably would be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect:

• changes affecting the economies of or financial, credit or capital market conditions anywhere in the world in which we and our subsidiaries operate, to the extent such
changes do not adversely affect us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a disproportionate manner relative to other similarly situated participants in the industries in
which we and our subsidiaries operate; 

• changes in the trading volume or trading price of our common stock in and of itself (provided that the facts and circumstances giving rise to such changes in such
volume or price may be deemed to constitute, and may be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or would reasonably be expected to be, individually
or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect); 

• changes in the industries in which we and our subsidiaries operate, to the extent such changes do not adversely affect us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a
disproportionate manner relative to other similarly situated participants in the industries in which we and our subsidiaries operate; 

• national or international political conditions, acts of war (whether or not declared), the commencement, continuation or escalation of a war, acts of armed hostility,
sabotage or terrorism or other international or national calamity or any material worsening of such conditions threatened or existing as of the date of the Merger
Agreement, to the extent such changes do not adversely affect us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a disproportionate manner relative to other similarly situated
participants in the industries in which we and our subsidiaries operate; 

• changes in law or GAAP, to the extent such changes do not adversely affect us or our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a manner disproportionate to other similarly
situated participants in industries in which we and our subsidiaries operate;

Change of Board Recommendation or Termination

       The Merger Agreement provides that neither our Board nor any committee of our Board will, or will agree or resolve to:

• approve, adopt, endorse, declare advisable or recommend to our stockholders, or publicly propose to approve, adopt, endorse, declare advisable or recommend to our
stockholders, any acquisition proposal or publicly disclose that our Board or any committee of our Board has determined that any acquisition proposal constitutes a
superior proposal; or 

• fail to include our Board's recommendation to our stockholders in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement in this proxy statement, fail to recommend that
stockholders reject any tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes an acquisition proposal, or withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify or publicly propose to
withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to SAP or Merger Sub, our Board's recommendation to our stockholders in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement (any of the actions referred to in this bullet of the preceding bullet are deemed to constitute a "change of Board recommendation").

       Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the conditions described below, our Board may, at any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, in response to a
superior proposal or an intervening event (as defined in the Merger Agreement and as described below under this heading), effect a change of Board recommendation or, in the case of a
superior proposal, terminate the Merger Agreement and simultaneously enter into an alternative acquisition agreement implementing a superior proposal.

       At any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, our Board may (i) effect a change of Board recommendation in response to a superior proposal or
(ii) terminate the Merger Agreement and simultaneously enter into an alternative acquisition agreement implementing a superior proposal only if (1) we receive an acquisition proposal from a
party that our Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, constitutes a superior proposal,
(2) our Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to our stockholders under applicable law and (3) in the case of clause (ii) above, concurrently with such termination we pay the fee described below under
"— Termination Fee and Expenses" beginning on page 87 of this proxy statement. However, for any such change of Board recommendation or termination to be valid, the following must
occur:

• we must provide prior written notice to SAP, at least four business days in advance of the change of Board recommendation or termination of the Merger Agreement, of
our intention to effect such a change of Board recommendation (which notice itself will not constitute a change of Board recommendation) or to enter into a definitive
agreement implementing a superior proposal (which notice itself will not constitute a change of Board recommendation), which notice must specify the details of such
superior proposal, and provide the execution draft of the definitive agreement with respect to such superior proposal and other material documents with respect to such
superior proposal, and the basis upon which our Board intends to effect a change of Board recommendation or to terminate this Agreement; and 

• prior to effecting a change of Board recommendation or terminating the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement implementing a superior proposal, (i) if
requested by SAP, we must negotiate, and we must cause our representatives to negotiate, during such four business day period of notice, with SAP in good faith to
enable SAP to make a binding written order to effect such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that the

superior proposal would no longer be superior to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (ii) following the end of the four business days, the Board
must consider any such binding offer in good faith and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
determine that the alternative proposal is still a superior proposal.

       In the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material revisions to the superior proposal, we are required to deliver a new notice to SAP pursuant to the requirements
set forth above (including the start of a new notice period for a superior proposal), except that the notice period will be at least three business days rather than four business days as
contemplated above.

       At any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, our Board may effect a change of Board recommendation in response to an intervening event only if our
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
our Board's fiduciary duties to our stockholders under applicable law. However, for any such change of Board recommendation to be valid, the following must occur:

• we must provide prior written notice to SAP, at least four business days in advance of the change of Board recommendation of our intention to effect a change of Board
recommendation, which notice must specify the details of the intervening event and the basis upon which our Board intends to effect a change of Board
recommendation; and 

• prior to effecting a change of Board recommendation, (i) if requested by SAP, we must negotiate, and we must cause our representatives to negotiate, during the
foregoing four business day intervening event notice period, with SAP in good faith to enable SAP to make a binding written order to effect such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that a change of Board recommendation is no longer necessary, and (ii) following the end of the four business days,
the Board must consider any such binding offer in good faith and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, and determine that notwithstanding the terms of such binding written offer, it would continue to be inconsistent with the director's fiduciary duties to our
stockholders under applicable law to not effect the change of Board recommendation.

       Should any changes to the circumstances applicable to the intervening event occur after the start of the notice period for the intervening event, we are required to deliver a new notice to
SAP pursuant to the requirements set forth above (including the start of a new notice period for the intervening event), except that the notice period must be at least three business days rather
than four business days as contemplated above.

       The covenant in the Merger Agreement generally prohibiting us from soliciting takeover proposals does not prevent us from complying with Rules 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, in each case in response to a tender offer; provided, however, that except as otherwise permitted by the terms of the Merger Agreement, such disclosure is limited to:
(i) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) an express rejection of any applicable acquisition proposal, and/or
(iii) an express reaffirmation of the our Board recommendation, which disclosure may, in each of the foregoing cases, include a description of any acquisition proposal and related
communications and evaluations to the extent required by law for such a communication.

       An "acquisition proposal" means any offer or proposal (whether or not in writing) concerning, for or relating to any

the twelve month period ending on the last day of our most recently completed fiscal quarter) or assets (measured by the greater of book value or fair market value
thereof as of the date of such transaction), taken as a whole, pursuant to which our stockholders (as a group) or such subsidiary of ours or our subsidiaries, as applicable,
immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 85% of the equity interests in or voting securities of the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; 

• our or any of our subsidiaries' liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or reorganization, other than one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries; 

• direct or indirect sale, transfer or disposition of assets (including by any license or lease, other than licenses or leases under customer agreements entered into in the

of our and our subsidiaries' consolidated net revenues or net income (for the twelve month period ending on the last day of our most recently completed fiscal quarter) or
assets (measured by the greater of book value or fair market value thereof as of the date of such transaction), taken as a whole; or 

• any combination of the foregoing transactions that results in one of the effects referenced in foregoing bullets above; provided that in no event will the transactions
between SAP, Merger Sub and us (or any other transactions between SAP, Merger Sub or their affiliates, on the one hand, and us and our subsidiaries, on the other
hand), be deemed to be an "acquisition proposal."

       A "superior proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide written offer or proposal (that has not been withdrawn and that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the
Merger Agreement), to acquire all of our outstanding equity interests, that (i) is not subject to a financing condition (and if financing is required, such financing is then committed to the party
or "group" (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making such offer or proposal), (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms and conditions contemplated
thereby and (iii) the Callidus Board has determined in good faith after consultation with our outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation is more favorable
to our stockholders (in their capacity as such) from a financial point of view than the merger, in each case taking into account the legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the written offer or
proposal, including the financing terms thereof, the likelihood and timing of consummation, and the identity of the party making such written offer or proposal.

Special Meeting of Callidus's Stockholders

       We have agreed, subject to any applicable legal restraints, to convene and hold a special meeting of our stockholders, for the purpose of the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our
stockholders, no earlier than the 30th calendar day and no later than the 40th calendar day immediately following the date of mailing of the definitive proxy statement to our stockholders. We
have also agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to solicit from our stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and to secure any other vote or consent of our
stockholders as required by the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, the DGCL or other applicable law to effect the merger. We may not change the record date or postpone or adjourn the
special meeting without the prior written consent of SAP, except with written notice to, and in consultation with, SAP we may adjourn the special meeting by not more than ten calendar days
in order to comply with applicable law or obtain a quorum necessary for the special meeting and for obtaining stockholder approval of the merger, and SAP may cause us to postpone or
adjourn the special meeting by prior written notice to us.

       Unless the Merger Agreement is terminated, we are required to convene and hold the stockholders meeting regardless of whether our Board effects a change of Board recommendation.
Further, our obligation to hold the stockholders meeting will not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to us of any acquisition proposal or
acquisition inquiry (whether or not such acquisition proposal is a superior proposal). Unless the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, we have agreed that we will not
submit to the vote of our stockholders any acquisition proposal (whether or not a superior proposal) prior to the vote of our stockholders with respect to the merger at the special meeting.

Efforts to Consummate the Merger; Regulatory Matters

       We have agreed, upon the reasonable request of SAP, to use our reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers of third parties with respect to any of our or our
subsidiaries' contracts, as may be necessary or appropriate for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or required by the terms of any such contract
(including such consents as are necessary such that no third party will obtain additional rights under any such contract as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement) as a result of the execution, performance or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; provided that, we must coordinate with SAP and
cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers should be sought to be obtained from third parties (including under any of our material contracts) in connection
with consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

Termination Fee and Expenses

       Each party will generally pay its own fees and expenses in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, whether or not the merger
is consummated.

       We will be required to pay a termination fee of $75 million to SAP if at any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, our Board determines to terminate the
Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that such termination will not be effective unless we, concurrently with
such termination, enter into the alternative acquisition agreement and pay the termination fee.

       We will be required to pay a termination fee of $75 million to SAP if the Merger Agreement is terminated by SAP for any of the reasons set forth in the first six bullets above under the
header "— Termination of the Merger Agreement — by SAP if," starting on page 86 of this proxy statement.

       We will also be required to pay a termination fee of $75 million to SAP if:

• the Merger Agreement is terminated by either SAP or us for any of the following reasons: 

o the Outside Date is reached, and (1) our stockholders have not adopted the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of stockholders (or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof) that we have held and completed for such purpose, or (2) SAP would then be entitled to terminate the Merger Agreement as a result of
our willful breach of the Merger Agreement;

o a willful breach of the Merger Agreement by us; and 

• prior to the date of such termination of the Merger Agreement, an acquisition proposal has been made known to us or publicly disclosed (and not publicly withdrawn
prior to such termination) and concurrently with, or within 12 months after, such termination, we either (i) consummate a transaction that constitutes an acquisition
proposal, or (ii) enter into a definitive agreement to engage in a transaction or a tender offer is commenced that, in either case, constitutes an acquisition proposal, and
such transaction or tender offer is subsequently consummated or completed (whether or not such consummation or completion occurs before or after the 12-month
period following such termination). However, if the party with which a transaction or tender offer is ultimately consummated is the same party that made an acquisition
proposal prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the requirement that a breach by us be "willful," in the first and third sub-bullets of the preceding bullet will
be disregarded for purposes of determining if SAP if entitled to the termination fee.

Solely for purposes of this paragraph, an acquisition proposal is an offer or proposal concerning, for or relating to (1) the purchase of, or commencement of a tender offer that if consummated
would result in the acquisition of, 50% or more of our equity interests or voting securities; (2) the acquisition of 50% or more of any class of equity or other voting security of one or more of
our subsidiaries, which subsidiaries individually or in the aggregate generate 50% or more of our consolidated net revenues or net income or constitute more than 50% of our consolidated
assets; (3) a merger, consolidation, business combination or another similar transaction, involving us or one or more of our subsidiaries, the businesses of which individually or in the aggregate
generate 50% or more of our consolidated net revenues or net income or constitute more than 50% of our consolidated assets, where our stockholders or the stockholders of our subsidiaries, as
applicable, immediately preceding such transaction would hold less than 50% of the stock or the voting securities in the surviving entity of such transaction; (4) the liquidation, dissolution,
recapitalization or reorganization of Callidus or any of our subsidiaries other than a wholly-owned subsidiary; (5) the sale of our or our subsidiaries' assets which assets generate 50% or more
of our consolidated net revenues or net income or constitute more than 50% of our consolidated assets; or (6) any combination of the foregoing.

Indemnification and Insurance

       For a period of six years from and after the effective time of the merger, Callidus, as the surviving corporation, will (and SAP will cause the surviving corporation to) indemnify and hold
harmless all of our and our subsidiaries' past and present directors, officers and employees to the same extent such persons were indemnified as of the date of the Merger Agreement by us
pursuant to applicable law, our and our subsidiaries' certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and specified indemnification agreements in existence on the date of the Merger Agreement,
arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as our and our subsidiaries' directors, officers or employees occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger. The surviving corporation
will (and SAP will cause the surviving corporation to) advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any actions with respect to the matters
subject to indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence in accordance with the procedures set forth in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and indemnification agreements, if any,
in existence on the date of the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that any of our and our subsidiaries' directors, officers or employees to whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to the
extent required by the DGCL or by the applicable indemnification agreement or organization document, to repay such advanced expenses to the surviving corporation if it is ultimately
determined that such director, officer or employee is not entitled to

indemnification under applicable law or pursuant to the applicable indemnification agreement or organization document.

       In the event the surviving corporation or any of our subsidiaries consolidate with or merge into another entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to another entity, then proper provision will be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of
such assets, as the case may be, assumes the obligations described above (without relieving SAP of the obligations described above).

       We will obtain prior to the effective time of the merger a directors and officers runoff insurance policy, or "tail" insurance policy, with a claims period of six years from the effective time
of the merger with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who were, as of the date of the Merger Agreement, covered by our directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy, for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the merger, on terms that are no less favorable than our policies in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement.
Neither we nor the surviving corporation will be required to pay an annual premium for such tail policy in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid prior the date of the Merger
Agreement.

Employee Matters

       SAP has agreed to generally recognize the service of our employees (and employees of our subsidiaries) in the United States prior to the effective time of the merger for vesting, eligibility
and level of benefits purposes (but not for accrual purposes, except for vacation and severance, if applicable) in connection with certain employee benefit plans maintained by SAP or its
subsidiaries in which our employees will participate following the completion of the merger in each case except to the extent that recognizing such service would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, SAP has agreed to waive pre-existing condition limitations (to the extent satisfied under one of our benefit plans immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger), waive participation waiting periods (to the extent waived or satisfied under one of our benefit plans immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) and
credit co-payments and deductibles paid by our employees for the plan year in which the effective time of the merger occurs under certain welfare plans in which our employees may be
eligible to participate after the completion of the merger, to the extent that we provide relevant documentation reasonably requested by SAP within 20 days of such request. Until December 31,
2018, SAP or its subsidiaries will provide our employees in the United States who continue to be employed by SAP or a subsidiary of SAP with base salary and base wage rates, and target
annual cash performance bonus opportunities (but not equity or cash-settled equity based incentive opportunities) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate than such employees were
eligible to earn from us immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

Additional Agreements

       Except as would violate applicable law or securities exchange rules, we, SAP and SAP SE have agreed that no public release or announcement concerning the merger will be issued
without the prior written consent of SAP and us.

       We and SAP have agreed to promptly notify each other of the occurrence of any event that is reasonably likely to cause any condition to the obligations of SAP or us, respectively, to effect
the merger or any other transaction not to be satisfied.

       We and SAP have agreed, subject to applicable law, that our executive officers, including our chief executive officer, will, in response to reasonable requests from SAP, discuss with SAP,
in good faith, material operational developments, the status of relationships with customers, resellers, partners,

suppliers, licensors, licensees, distributors and others having material business relationships with Callidus, the status of ongoing operations and other matters relating to our business as
reasonably requested by SAP.

       We have agreed, subject to applicable law, to afford to SAP, Merger Sub and SAP SE and their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors,
agents and other representatives:

• upon reasonable prior notice to us, access to the officers, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of ours and our subsidiaries, and to the books and records thereof
(excluding any confidential information contained in personnel files to the extent the disclosure of such information is prohibited by privacy and security laws), and,
with our consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), to our and our subsidiaries' employees; and 

• upon reasonable request, furnish as promptly as reasonably practicable such information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and
other aspects of Callidus and our subsidiaries.

       Notwithstanding the obligations described above, we may restrict the foregoing access (i) to the extent that providing access to such properties or information would violate applicable law,
our or our subsidiaries' contracts, and an order or (ii) would reasonably be expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work product privilege. In the event that
we do not provide access or information in reliance on foregoing, we will promptly notify SAP and use our reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, as the case may be, obtain any
necessary clearance or consent in order to permit such access or disclosure and provide such access or communicate such information to SAP or its representatives in a way, to the extent
reasonably practicable, that would not violate the applicable law or contract or waive any such a privilege.

       We have also agreed to the following with SAP:

• to provide SAP with the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or compromise of any litigation action against us and/or our directors relating to the
transactions and we have agreed to obtain the prior written consent of SAP prior to settling or satisfying any such action; 

• additional agreements relating to, among other things, reporting requirements Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, restrictions on entry into a stockholder rights
agreement or "poison pill", and timely filings with the SEC of all of our documents required to be filed under the Exchange Act; and 

• cooperate with SAP and its representatives in connection with the arrangement of any financing to be consummated in order to fund the payment of the aggregate
merger consideration and SAP's other obligations under the Merger Agreement, subject to certain limitations as specified in the Merger Agreement.

Extension, Waiver and Amendment of the Merger Agreement

       We, SAP and Merger Sub may amend the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the effective time of the merger. However, after the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our
stockholders, no amendment can be made that by law or the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market requires further approval by our stockholders without obtaining such approval.

       We, SAP or Merger Sub may extend the time for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties under the Merger Agreement, waive any inaccuracies in another
party's representations and warranties and waive compliance by another party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the Merger Agreement. However, after the adoption of the
Merger Agreement by our stockholders, no waiver can be provided that by law or the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market requires further approval by our stockholders without obtaining such
approval.

ADVISORY VOTE REGARDING MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION PAID TO NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

Compensation Paid to Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger

       In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing our stockholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote on the merger-related compensation
that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the proposed merger. The amount of this compensation is set forth and described below in the table
entitled "Golden Parachute Compensation" and the accompanying footnotes on page 51 and under "The Merger — Interests of Callidus Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger —
Potential Payments in Connection with a Change of Control," respectively. As required by those rules, we are asking our stockholders to adopt the following resolution:

RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Callidus hereby APPROVE, on an advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Callidus's named executive officers in
connection with the merger, in each case pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, described in the table entitled "Golden Parachute Compensation" and the accompanying footnotes
and related narrative discussion beginning on page 51 of Callidus's proxy statement for its special meeting of stockholders to be held on March 29, 2018.

       Compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers following the merger pursuant to agreements or understandings between our named executive officers
and SAP is not subject to the advisory vote on the compensation proposal. There are no agreements between SAP and our named executive officers regarding the officers' post-closing
employment terms or compensation arrangements.

Effect of Advisory Vote

       The vote on this proposal is a vote separate and apart from the votes on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the proposal to approve adjournment of the special meeting.
Accordingly, you may vote to approve either of the other proposals and vote not to approve this proposal, and vice versa. Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the
proposed merger.

       Because the vote on this proposal is only advisory in nature, it will not be binding on either Callidus or SAP regardless of whether the proposed merger is completed. Accordingly, as the
merger-related compensation described herein is contractual with respect to the executives, regardless of the outcome of this advisory vote, such compensation will be payable, subject only to
the conditions applicable thereto, if the proposed merger is completed.

Vote Required and Board Recommendation

       Approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the
compensation proposal at the special meeting. An abstention will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal. A failure to submit a proxy card or vote in person will not affect
whether the compensation proposal has been approved, although it will have the practical effect of reducing the number of affirmative votes required to achieve the required majority by
reducing the total number of shares from which the majority is calculated.

Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the non-binding, advisory
approval of the compensation that may be paid to our named executive officers that is

based upon or relates to the merger.

ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

Adjournment of the Special Meeting

       In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, it is expected that the Board will recommend adjournment of the special meeting to solicit additional proxies if permitted
by the Merger Agreement. In addition, in the event that the number of shares of Callidus common stock present in person and represented by proxy at the special meeting and voting "FOR" the
merger is insufficient to adopt the Merger Agreement, we may move to adjourn the special meeting in order to enable our Board to solicit additional proxies in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement if permitted by the Merger Agreement. In either event, we will ask our stockholders to vote only upon the adjournment proposal and not on the other proposals discussed in
this proxy statement.

Vote Required and Board Recommendation

       Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date, if our Board determines that it is necessary or appropriate and is permitted by the Merger Agreement, to solicit
additional proxies if there is not a quorum present or there are not sufficient votes in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the time of the special meeting, requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the adjournment proposal at the special meeting. An abstention will have
the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal. A failure to submit a proxy card or vote in person will not affect whether the adjournment proposal has been approved, although it will
have the practical effect of reducing the number of affirmative votes required to achieve the required majority by reducing the total number of shares from which the majority is calculated.

Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" this proposal.

OTHER MATTERS

       No business may be transacted at the special meeting other than the matters set forth in this proxy statement.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

       If the merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any of our future stockholder meetings. However, if the merger is not
completed, our public stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in our stockholders meetings and we will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2018.

       If the merger is not completed, our stockholders who intend to have a proposal considered for inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy for presentation at our 2018 annual
meeting of stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act must have already submitted the proposal to us to the attention of General Counsel, 4140 Dublin Boulevard, Suite 400,
Dublin, California 94568, which must have been received by us no later than December 28, 2017. If the date of our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders is moved more than 30 days before or
30 days after the anniversary date of our 2017 annual meeting, the deadline for inclusion of proposals in our proxy statement and proxy is instead a reasonable time before we begin to print
and mail its proxy materials. Stockholders who intend to present a proposal at such meeting without inclusion of such proposal in our proxy statement and form of proxy pursuant to Rule 14a-
8 under the Exchange Act are required to provide the information required by our bylaws and give timely notice to our General Counsel in accordance with our bylaws at the aforementioned
address no earlier than February 14, 2018 and no later than March 16, 2018. If the date of our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders is moved more than 30 days before or 60 days after the
anniversary of our 2017 annual meeting, then notice of such proposal must be received no earlier than the close of business on the date 90 days prior to the meeting and no later than the close
of business on the later of (i) the date 60 days prior to the meeting, and (ii) the date 10 days after public announcement of the meeting date. We reserve the right to reject, rule out of order, or
take other appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements, including conditions established by the SEC. Callidus
stockholders may contact our General Counsel at our principal executive offices for a copy of the relevant bylaw provisions regarding the requirements for making stockholder proposals and
nominating director candidates.

certificates. Our record stockholders who have further questions about their share certificates or the exchange of our common stock for cash should contact the paying agent.

ACCURATE AS OF ANY DATE OTHER THAN THAT DATE (OR AS OF AN EARLIER DATE IF SO INDICATED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT). NEITHER THE

              Section 1.03  Meeting of Stockholders to Approve the Merger.

                            (a)         Promptly, and in any event within 10 Business Days, after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC preliminary proxy materials
for the Special Meeting (together with any amendments and supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the "Proxy Statement") relating to the Merger and this Agreement.

                            (b)          Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.03(a), prior to filing the preliminary Proxy Statement, a definitive Proxy Statement or any Other Filing with the SEC in
connection with the Transactions, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each such filing in advance, and the Company
shall include in such filing all comments reasonably proposed by Parent in respect of such filings; provided that to the extent such comments relate to an Acquisition Proposal or a Change of
Board Recommendation, the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to, but shall not be obligated to include, any such comments reasonably proposed. The Company
shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC or its staff to such filings (or of notice of the SEC's intent to review) and of any request by the SEC or
its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing or for additional or supplemental information in connection therewith. The Company shall, as promptly as

provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any responses to any such comments or inquiries by the SEC or its staff, (2) shall include in such responses all

case the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to, but shall not be obligated to include, any such comments reasonably proposed), (3) except with respect to a document
incorporating a Change of Board Recommendation, shall not file or mail such document, or respond to the SEC or its staff, prior to receiving the approval of Parent, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (4) shall provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussions or meetings with the SEC or its staff with
respect to such filings. The Company shall respond in good faith to any comments by the SEC or its staff as promptly as reasonably practicable. Parent shall provide its comments to the
Company as promptly as reasonably practicable.

                            (c)          If the Company: (i) does not receive comments from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall file definitive proxy materials

in any event on or prior to the fifth Business Day immediately following clearance by the SEC with respect to such comments.

                            (d)         If, at any time prior to the date of the Special Meeting, Parent or the Company discovers any event or information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or
any of their Affiliates that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and the Company shall
cause an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information to be filed with the SEC as promptly as practicable thereafter and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

                            (e)         The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with applicable Law: (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders as promptly as practicable, and in any event (to the extent permissible under applicable Law) no earlier than 30 days and no later than 40 days after the mailing of the definitive
Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company, for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the "Special Meeting") and (ii) subject to Section 5.03, use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from the stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and secure any other vote or consent of the stockholders of the
Company as required by the rules of NASDAQ, the DGCL or other applicable Law to effect the Merger. The Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date that shall be set as the
"record date" for the Special Meeting in advance of providing notice thereof to NASDAQ. The Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date of the Special Meeting and shall not
change the record date or postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the Company may,
following prior written notice to, and consultation with, Parent, adjourn the Special Meeting by not more than 10 calendar days to the extent (and only if and to the extent) (i) necessary to
ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel, determines in good faith is necessary to comply with
applicable Law, is made available to the Company's stockholders in advance of the Special Meeting, (ii) that, as of the time that the Special Meeting is originally scheduled, adjournment of the
Special Meeting is necessary to enable the Company to solicit additional proxies required to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Special Meeting and to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval or (iii) otherwise required by applicable Law, order or a request from the SEC or its staff. The Company may, and if so requested by Parent shall, adjourn the
Special Meeting in order to provide for the expiration of any time period provided for in Section 5.03(d) or Section 5.03(e).

                            (f)          The Company shall ensure that the Special Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all Persons solicited in connection with the Special
Meeting are solicited, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Law. The adoption of this Agreement and adjournment of the Special Meeting, as necessary, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matters that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the
Special Meeting, unless otherwise approved in writing by Parent.

                            (g)         Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that (i) its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special Meeting shall not
be affected by any Change of Board Recommendation and (ii) its obligations pursuant to this Section 1.03 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or the receipt of any Acquisition Inquiry. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Section 7.01, the Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the stockholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not

Merger Sub, or with respect to which Parent or Merger Sub otherwise has, directly or indirectly, voting power, in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to deliver or provide (or cause to be delivered or provided), in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company, any other stockholder vote or consent with respect to the Shares then
owned of record by Parent or Merger Sub, or with respect to which Parent or Merger Sub otherwise has, directly or indirectly, voting power, that may be required by the rules of NASDAQ, the
DGCL or other applicable Law to effect the Merger.

ARTICLE II
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

              Section 2.01  Conversion of Securities.    At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any
of the following securities:

                            (a)          Conversion of Shares.    Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.01(b) and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, payable net to the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with Section 2.02(f), upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such Shares (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
surrender of such Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with Section 2.02. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shares subject to RSU Awards or PSU Awards shall be treated in accordance with
Section 2.04.

                            (b)          Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.    All Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company Subsidiary
that is directly or indirectly wholly-owned by the Company, and all Shares owned of record by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

                            (c)           Merger Sub Common Stock.    Each share of common stock, no par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

              Section 2.02  Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.

                            (a)          Paying Agent.    Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall designate a reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent"). From time to time after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at times necessary to pay the Merger Consideration to which former holders of Shares (other than
Dissenting Shares and Shares subject to RSU Awards or PSU Awards) shall be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(a) upon surrender of Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as the case
may be. Such funds shall be invested or otherwise held by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or Merger Sub, in their sole discretion. Earnings from such investments, if any, shall be the
sole and exclusive property of Parent or Merger Sub, and no part of any such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

                            (b)          Procedures for Surrender.    As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates that prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the "Certificates") or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry
Shares"), in each case, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement:

                                             (i)       a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or
the Paying Agent may reasonably specify; and

                                            (ii)       instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration.

                            (c)           Cancellation of Shares; Payment of Merger Consideration.    Upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form in accordance with the instructions thereto, with respect to such Certificates or an agent's message in the
case of a book entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon.

                            (d)          Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares.    All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect
to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

                            (e)          Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability.    At any time following the six month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as
general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger

Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.02(b), without interest and subject to any withholding of
Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with Section 2.02(e). If, immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in
Section 2.02(b) to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

                            (f)           Withholding Rights.    Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration or any other payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Article II to any former holder of Shares, Company Options or Shares subject to RSU Awards or PSU Awards,
as applicable, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Law, including with respect to any stock transfer Taxes payable by former holders of Shares, Company
Options or Shares subject to RSU Awards or PSU Awards. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, Parent shall pay
(unless the Paying Agent is the entity withholding such amounts, in which case, Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to pay) such amounts to the appropriate taxing authority and such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

                            (g)          Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.    In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof and, if required by Parent, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration, the posting by such Person of a bond in such sum
as Parent may direct as indemnity against any Action that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such Certificates, the Paying
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of Shares formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated by this Article II.

              Section 2.03  Dissenting Shares.    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is
entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of
the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required
by applicable Law in accordance with Section 2.02(f). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals
of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the

fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and to control all negotiations and Actions with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment (unless required by Law) with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent to pay for Shares that have become Dissenting
Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

              Section 2.04  Treatment of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Performance RSUs.    Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company to make
available existing Company cash, and/or otherwise deposit or cause to be deposited with the Company funds, in amounts and at times necessary to make the payments described in this
Section 2.04. No later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have taken all requisite action such that:

                            (a)          Treatment of Company Options.    Each Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall
be, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of such Company Option or any other Person,
cancelled and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, within 30 days following the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of
(x) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Company Option, and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price under such Company
Option. If the per share exercise price under any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled pursuant to this
Section 2.04(a) without payment of consideration.

                            (b)          Treatment of Unvested RSU Awards.    Each Share subject to a Company RSU (each such award, an "RSU Award") that remains outstanding immediately prior to,
and is not vested immediately prior to, the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, in cash, the Merger Consideration, and such right shall remain subject to the
time-based vesting (including any "double-trigger" acceleration) terms that applied with respect to the applicable RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time under the award
agreement governing such RSU Award (the "Replacement RSU"). Each Replacement RSU shall not vest or become payable by the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time and shall
instead vest and become payable by the Surviving Corporation on the date upon which the applicable Share subject to the RSU Award would have vested under the time-based vesting terms
and other conditions, including any "double-trigger" acceleration terms, as set forth in any agreements listed on Section 3.11(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided that any RSU
Awards granted after the date of this Agreement as set forth in Section 5.01(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.01(a)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. If such terms and conditions are not satisfied and as a result vesting ceases to continue at any point after the Effective Time, the holder of the Replacement RSU shall
have no right to receive any payment in respect of the forfeited Replacement RSU or the original RSU Award. Following the Effective Time, no Replacement RSU may be pledged,
encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other than to the Surviving Corporation, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable
process in satisfaction of any Liability of such Person, prior to the payment to such Person of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04(b). Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing to the contrary, each RSU Award held by a non-employee director of the Company that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested,
shall not be assumed, converted or substituted for by Parent and shall instead be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for a payment by the Surviving Corporation in respect of each
Share subject to such RSU Award in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, to be paid in cash in a single lump-sum payment as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 30 days)
following the Effective Time.

                            (c)           Treatment of Vested Company RSUs and Company Performance RSUs.    Each Share subject to a Company RSU or Company Performance RSU that is vested but
not yet issued as of the Effective Time shall not be assumed or substituted for by Parent and shall instead be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for a payment by the Surviving
Corporation in respect of such vested and unissued Share subject to a Company RSU or Company Performance RSU in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, to be paid in cash in a
single lump-sum payment as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 30 days) following the Effective Time.

                            (d)          Treatment of Unvested Company Performance RSUs.    Each Share subject to a Company Performance RSU (each such award, a "PSU Award") that remains
outstanding immediately prior to, and is not vested immediately prior to, the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, in cash, the Merger Consideration, and
such right shall remain subject to the time-based vesting (including any "double-trigger" acceleration) terms that applied with respect to the applicable PSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "Replacement PSU"). Each Replacement PSU shall not vest or become payable by the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time and shall instead vest and become
payable by the Surviving Corporation on the performance period end date set forth in Section 2.04(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule upon which the applicable Share subject to the PSU
Award would have vested under the time-based vesting terms and other conditions (other than any performance-based vesting conditions and criteria), including any "double-trigger"
acceleration terms, applicable to such PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. If such terms and conditions are not satisfied and as a result vesting ceases to continue at any point
after the Effective Time, the holder of the Replacement PSU shall have no right to receive any payment in respect of the forfeited Replacement PSU or the original PSU Award. Following the
Effective Time, no Replacement PSU may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by operation of law) by any Person, other than to the Surviving
Corporation, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any Liability of such Person, prior to the payment to such Person of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.04(d). Each PSU Award that will be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.04(d) shall be treated as if the award
had vested at the pay-out levels set forth in Section 2.04(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Following the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration payable with respect to PSU Awards
pursuant to Section 2.04(d) shall not be subject to any of the performance-based vesting terms that currently apply to such awards but shall, in all events, continue to be subject to the time-
based vesting terms currently applicable to such awards.

              Section 2.05  Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan.    Each current "Offering Period" (as defined in the ESPP) in progress as of the date of this Agreement under the ESPP shall
continue, and, except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.05, the Shares shall be issued to participants thereunder on the next currently scheduled purchase dates thereunder occurring after
the date of this Agreement as provided under, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the ESPP. Any Offering Period in progress as of the Effective Time shall be shortened, and the last day
of each such Offering Period shall be the second Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time. No new Offering Period shall commence under the ESPP at or after the date of this
Agreement except, in the case of valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01, following such termination. Each then outstanding ESPP Purchase Right shall be
exercised automatically on the last day of such Offering Period. Notwithstanding any restrictions on transfer of stock in the ESPP, the treatment in the Merger of any Shares under this
provision shall be in accordance with Section 2.01(a). The Company shall terminate the ESPP as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall, promptly after the date of
this Agreement, take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to this Section 2.05.

              Section 2.06  No Right to Equity Under Awards.    The parties agree that following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Option, Company RSU, Company Performance RSU,
ESPP Purchase Right or any other equity-based awards shall have any right to acquire any Equity Interest (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any of
the Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation.

               Section 2.07  Notices; Board or Committee Resolutions.

                              (a)           To the extent necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated in Section 2.04 and Section 2.05, the Company shall, at least 10 Business Days prior to the
anticipated Effective Time, use its reasonable best efforts to provide notice, in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, to all holders of outstanding Company Options and Shares
subject to RSU Awards or PSU Awards that are subject to Section 2.04 and to all holders of ESPP Purchase Rights that are subject to Section 2.05.

                              (b)          Prior to the Closing, the Company Board or any committee thereof that administers the Company Stock Option Plans shall adopt resolutions, in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent, that (i) prohibit the granting of new awards under any Company Stock Option Plan effective as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) approve the transactions
contemplated in Section 2.04 as valid under the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the award agreements issued thereunder, and (iii) approve the transactions contemplated in
Section 2.05 as valid under the terms of the ESPP and the award agreements issued thereunder and terminate the ESPP as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time, and further document
that:

                                             (A)        the transactions contemplated in Section 2.04 are consistent with the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans and the award agreements issued
thereunder;

                                             (B)         the transactions contemplated in Section 2.05 are valid under the terms of the ESPP and the award agreements issued thereunder;

                                             (C)         the Surviving Corporation's assumption of the obligation to pay any Replacement RSUs or Replacement PSUs that vest pursuant to the terms set forth in
Section 2.04 will result in the Surviving Corporation substituting an equivalent award for each RSU Award or PSU Award that becomes subject to the terms set forth in Section 2.04; and

                                             (D)        the consummation of the Merger will not accelerate the vesting of any shares subject to RSU Awards or PSU Awards that are exchanged for Replacement
RSUs or Replacement PSUs, except, with respect to RSU Awards, as specifically provided by Section 2.04(b) with respect to any such RSU Awards held by non-employee directors of the
Company.

               Section 2.08  Adjustments to Prevent Dilution.    In the event that the Company changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of Shares issued and outstanding prior
to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding Shares, at any time during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such transaction;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.08 shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

              The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as set forth in the correspondingly numbered Section of the disclosure schedule delivered by the

                            (a)         Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent the
concept of "good standing" is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, except with respect to
the Company Subsidiaries, where the failure to be in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has all requisite corporate or organizational, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                            (b)         The Company has delivered or caused to be delivered to Parent and Merger Sub true and complete copies of the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws, and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational or governing documents, of each Company Subsidiary. Each of such documents is in full force and effect. The
Company is not in violation of the Company Certificate or Company Bylaws, and the Company Subsidiaries are not in violation in any material respect of their respective organizational or
governing documents.

                            (c)           None of the Company or Company Subsidiaries is an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

                            (d)          Section 3.01(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) a true and complete list of each Company Subsidiary, together with the jurisdiction of organization
or formation of each Company Subsidiary and (ii) the directors and officers of the Company and each Company Subsidiary, as of the date of this Agreement.

              Section 3.02  Capitalization.

                            (a)         The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.001 per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"). As of the close of business on January 26, 2018 (the "Capitalization Date"), there were 66,022,377 Shares issued and outstanding and
2,338,797 Shares were held in treasury by the Company. No shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding.

                            (b)         As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date (without giving pro forma effect to the agreements set forth on Section 3.02(b)(iii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule), the Company has no shares of capital stock reserved for or otherwise subject to issuance, except for (i) 178,874 Shares that are subject to the outstanding Company Options under
the Company Stock Option Plans, (ii) 2,300,051 Shares that are subject to the outstanding Company RSUs under the Company Stock Option Plans, (iii) 681,043 Shares that are subject to

insurance or group annuity contract, administration and similar agreements, and investment management or investment advisory agreements, (vii) the most recent nondiscrimination tests
performed under the Code (including 401(k) and 401(m) tests) for each Company Benefit Plan, and (viii) all filings made with any Governmental Entity within the past five years, including
any filings under a government sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or similar program (including the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System and the Department of Labor
Delinquent Filer Program or Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program).

                              (c)           Each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained, operated, and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and any related documents or
agreements and in compliance in all material respects in accordance with all Law, including ERISA and the Code. Contributions (including any premiums) required to be made under the terms
of any of the Company Benefit Plans as of the date of this Agreement have been timely made or, if not yet due, have been properly reflected on the Most Recent Balance Sheet. With respect to
the Company Benefit Plans, no event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate
or any Company Benefit Plan fiduciary could be subject to any Liability (other than for routine benefit Liabilities) under the terms of, or with respect to, such Company Benefit Plans, ERISA,
the Code or any other applicable Law, nor would negotiation or consummation of the Transactions give rise to such Liability. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, all Tax, annual
reporting and other filings with a Governmental Entity required by ERISA, the Code and other applicable Law have been timely filed with the appropriate Governmental Entity and all notices
and disclosures have been timely provided to participants.

                              (d)          Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code either (i) has a current favorable determination letter from the IRS as to
its qualified status (or is waiting to receive a favorable determination letter for an application filed during the last 12 months of its previous remedial amendment cycle), or (ii) may rely upon a
prototype opinion letter, and each Company Benefit Plan and related trust which is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code is so exempt. No fact
or event has occurred that could adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust. There has been no termination, partial
termination or discontinuance of contributions to any Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Code Section 401(a).

                              (e)           There has been no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and other than a transaction that is exempt
under a statutory or administrative exemption) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that could result in Liability to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate. There
have been no breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA (or breaches of any other fiduciary duty under applicable Law)

Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate. Each Company Benefit Plan (other than an employment, severance, change in control or other similar agreement with an individual) can be unilaterally
amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms by the Company, a Company Subsidiary or an ERISA Affiliate, without material Liability
to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate (other than (A) Liability for ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred in a termination event or (B) Liability for

the date of such amendment, termination or discontinuation to the extent that either (x) there are sufficient assets set aside in a trust or insurance Contract to satisfy such Liability or (y) such
Liability is reflected on the Most Recent Balance Sheet). No Action or, to the Company's Knowledge, investigation is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the IRS or United States Department of Labor (other than routine benefits claims). None of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has any Liability under Section 502 of ERISA. All contributions and payments to such Company Benefit Plan are fully deductible under
Sections 162 or 404 of the Code. No amount is subject to Tax as unrelated business taxable income under Section 511 of the Code, and no excise tax could reasonably be expected to be
imposed upon the Company under Chapter 43 of the Code.

                              (f)           Neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever (i) maintained a Company Benefit Plan that was subject to Section 412 of the
Code or Title IV of ERISA or had any Liability with respect to such plan or (ii) been obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) that is
subject to ERISA. No Company Benefit Plan is funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employees' beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code,
or is funded through a "welfare benefit fund" as defined in Section 419(e) of the Code or a supplemental unemployment benefit plan within the meaning of Section 501(c)(17) of the Code.

                              (g)           Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as
termination of employment) will (i) result in any compensatory payment becoming due to any director or employee of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate or any of
their respective Affiliates, or to any Governmental Entity or other Person on behalf of any such director or employee, from the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate or any
of their respective Affiliates under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan, (iii) result in any acceleration of the
time of payment or vesting of any benefits or (iv) result in the payment of any amount that, individually or in combination with any other such payment, would not be deductible pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code (determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code) or Section 162(m) of the Code.

                              (h)          Except as required by Law, no Company Benefit Plan provides any retiree or post-employment health, disability, life insurance or other welfare benefits (whether or
not insured) to any Person. The Company, each Company Subsidiary and each ERISA Affiliate are in material compliance with (i) the requirements of the applicable health care continuation
and notice provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, and the regulations (including proposed regulations) thereunder, and any similar state law
and (ii) the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations (including the proposed regulations) thereunder.

                              (i)           The Company does not maintain any Company Benefit Plans that are or may reasonably be deemed to be a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined
in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code). No award granted under any of the Company Stock Option Plans is or may reasonably be deemed to be a "non-qualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) subject to Section 409A of the Code. None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate is a party to, or otherwise obligated
under, any Company Benefit Plan that provides for the gross-up of the Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

                              (j)           All Foreign Employee Benefit Plans (i) have been maintained, operated and funded in all material respects in accordance with applicable Law (including applicable
Tax withholding and reporting requirements and applicable legal filings), (ii) if they are intended to qualify for special tax

investigations pending or scheduled by any Governmental Entity pertaining to the Employment Practices of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; and (ii) no complaints relating to
Employment Practices of the Company or any Company Subsidiary have been filed with any Governmental Entity or submitted in writing to the Company or any Company Subsidiary. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred, nor does any condition or circumstance exist, that would reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the commencement of any labor
strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts, or any similar activity or dispute. To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are not engaged, and have
never been engaged, in any unfair labor practice (as defined under the National Labor Relations Act) and there is no charge or complaint against the Company or any Company Subsidiary by
the National Labor Relations Board, any comparable state or foreign agency, or any individual, pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened.

There are no current and there have not been any labor strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts, or any similar activity or dispute, affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary
during the last five years. The consent of, consultation of or the rendering of formal advice by any labor or trade union, works council or any other employee representative body is not required
for the Company to enter into this Agreement or to consummate any of the Transactions.

                              (c)           To the Knowledge of the Company, no employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in violation of any term of any employment Contract, non-
disclosure or confidentiality agreement, noncompetition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary by which the individual is employed because of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by it or to the use of Trade Secrets or
proprietary information of others.

                              (d)          Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is in compliance with the Worker Readjustment and Notification Act (29 U.S.C. §2101) (the "WARN Act") and
any applicable state laws or other Laws regarding redundancies, reductions in force, mass layoffs, and plant closings, including

employees, representatives, any state dislocated worker unit and local government officials, or any other Governmental Entity. For the past two years, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has taken any action that would constitute a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" within the meaning of the WARN Act or would otherwise trigger notice requirements or Liability under
any other comparable state or local law in the United States.

                              (e)           All current employees of the Company and any Company Subsidiary who work in the United States are, and all former employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary who worked in the United States whose employment terminated, voluntarily or involuntarily, since January 1, 2015 were, legally authorized to work for the Company or

any result affecting Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary in the manner described in such clauses must be solely related to the acquisition of, and future ownership by, Parent or Merger
Sub of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as contemplated by this Agreement or the Transactions and shall not, under any circumstances, result from any other Contract or arrangement

Company Products.

Subsidiaries, or (iii) the operation of the Company's or any of the Company Subsidiaries' respective businesses. In their provision of the Company Products, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries materially comply with all applicable Laws.

respective businesses and operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the "Systems"), and (ii) to implement and maintain business continuity, backup, security and disaster

or any Company Subsidiary.

(or such Person's representatives) that has made the Acquisition Proposal information relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and/or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books, records or the personnel of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, in each case pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided that (A) the Company did
not receive such Acquisition Proposal in connection with or as a result of breaching or violating the terms of this Section 5.03, (B) prior to engaging or participating in any such discussions or
negotiations with or furnishing any information to, such Person (or such Person's representatives), the Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Person and its representatives
and all of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of the Company's intention to engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with, or to furnish information
to, such Person (or such Person's representatives) and (C) contemporaneously with or prior to furnishing any information to such Person (or such Person's representatives), the Company
furnishes such information to Parent (to the extent such information has not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent).

                            (c)          In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.03(b), the Company shall, promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) after the receipt by the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, notify Parent orally and in writing of the receipt by the Company or the Company Representatives of such Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry, which notice shall include (x) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and (y) the identity of the Person or group (as

Subsidiaries or any of the Company Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person making an Acquisition Proposal or any of its Affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives, on the other hand. The Company shall provide Parent with at least 24 hours prior notice (or such shorter notice
as may be provided to the Company Board) of any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing the information
described in Section 5.03(b) or this Section 5.03(c) to Parent.

                            (d)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, other than in connection with or as a result
of breaching or violating this Section 5.03, that the Company Board concludes in good faith, After Consultation, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may, at any time prior to
the time when the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if it determines in good faith, After Consultation, that the failure to take such actions contemplated by clauses (x) and/or
(y) below would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (x) effect a Change of Board Recommendation as a
result of such Superior Proposal and/or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) and simultaneously enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement implementing such
Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing

Section 7.02; and; provided further that the Company Board may not effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
the foregoing clause (y) unless:

                                             (i)       the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four Business Days in advance of such Change of Board Recommendation or
termination (the "Superior Proposal Notice Period"), of its intention to effect such a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice itself shall not constitute a Change of Board
Recommendation) or to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement implementing such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the basis upon which
the Company Board intends to effect such Change of Board Recommendation or terminate this Agreement and the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and the identity of
the Person or group making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided the execution draft of the relevant proposed definitive transaction agreements with the Person
making such Superior Proposal (the "Alternative Acquisition Agreement")) and other material documents with respect to such Superior Proposal (including any with respect to the financing
thereof); and

                                            (ii)       prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement implementing
such Superior Proposal, (A) if requested by Parent, during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused the Company Representatives to
negotiate, with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to make a binding written offer to effect such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (B) following the end of such Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board shall have considered any such binding written
offer in good faith, and After Consultation, the Company Board shall have determined that, notwithstanding the terms of any such binding written offer, such Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal.

In the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent pursuant
to Section 5.03(d)(i) and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.03(d) with respect to such new written notice (including a new Superior Proposal Notice Period), except the
Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be at least three Business Days (rather than the four Business Days contemplated by Section 5.03(d)(i) above).

                            (e)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and solely in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board may effect a Change of
Board Recommendation prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained if the Company Board determines in good faith, After Consultation, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Company Board may not effect such a Change of Board
Recommendation unless:

                                             (i)       the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four Business Days in advance of such Change of Board Recommendation (the
"Intervening Event Notice Period"), of its intention to effect such a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice itself shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation), which
notice shall specify the details of such Intervening Event and the basis upon which the Company Board intends to effect such Change of Board Recommendation; and

                                             (ii)       prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, (A) if requested by Parent, during the Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company shall have
negotiated, and shall have caused the Company Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in good faith to enable Parent to make a binding written offer to effect such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that a Change of Board Recommendation is no longer necessary, and (B) following the end of such Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board
shall have considered any such binding written offer in good faith, and After Consultation, the Company Board shall have determined that, notwithstanding the terms of any such binding
written offer, it would continue to be inconsistent with the director's fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law to not effect the Change of Board
Recommendation.

In the event of any changes to the circumstances applicable to the Intervening Event, after the start of the Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent pursuant to Section 5.03(e)(i) and to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.03(e) with respect to such new written notice (including a new Intervening Event
Notice Period) except the Intervening Event Notice Period shall be at least three Business Days (rather than the four Business Days contemplated by Section 5.03(e)(i) above).

                            (f)          The Company shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment to this
Agreement and to the extent required by applicable Law to be disclosed in any Company SEC Documents.

Section 5.03 shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.03 by the Company.

                            (h)         Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 or otherwise complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9, in each case in response to a tender offer; provided, however, that, except as otherwise permitted under
Section 5.03, such disclosure is limited to: (i) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) an express rejection of
any applicable Acquisition Proposal, and/or (iii) an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation, which disclosure may, in each of the cases of clauses (i) through (iii),
include a factual description of any Acquisition Proposal and related communications and evaluations to the extent required by Law for such a communication.

                            (i)          The Company shall not make any Change of Board Recommendation that purports to change the approval of the Company Board in a way that would result in any
Takeover Law becoming applicable to the Transactions.

third parties with respect to any Contracts of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as may be necessary or appropriate for the consummation of the Transactions or required by the
terms of any Contract of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including such consents as are necessary such that no third party will obtain additional rights under any such Contract as a
result of the consummation of the Transactions) as a result of the execution, performance or consummation of the Transactions, including such consents as are required to be disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule; provided that, the Company shall coordinate with Parent and cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers should be sought to
be obtained from third parties (including under any Company Material Contract) in

                            (b)         Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Section 5.04(i), prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall use their
reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all other appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable and (ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits,
certificates, filings, exemptions, waivers, approvals, authorizations, registrations, waiting period expirations or terminations, clearances or orders required to be obtained by Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any Action or investigation by any Governmental Entity (including those in connection with the Antitrust Laws), in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions. The Company and Parent shall further (x) cooperate with
each other in determining which additional filings, and which additional consents, licenses, permits, certificates, exemptions, waivers, approvals, authorizations, registrations, clearances or
Orders are required to be obtained from Governmental Entities prior to the Effective Time in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and consummation of the

in connection with the Transactions and copies of all filings made by any filing party with any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions; provided, however, that materials
provided by the Company or Parent and their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to the other party may be redacted (x) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements entered into in
the ordinary course of business without a purpose of avoiding or limiting such party's obligations under this sentence and (y) as necessary to reasonably preserve attorney-client privilege or to
comply with applicable Law, provided, however, that such materials shall be provided in unredacted form to outside counsel to the receiving party in connection with any such application or
filing and the receiving party will cause its outside counsel receiving any such unredacted materials not to disclose such materials to the directors, officers or employees of such receiving party
without the prior written consent of the producing party.

communication by such party relating to the Transactions to any Governmental Entity. To the extent practicable, none of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of the investigation), Action or other inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party (or its counsel) the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. The parties to this Agreement will
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in
seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the

inquiry, provided, however, that materials provided by the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to the other party may be redacted (x) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business without a purpose of avoiding or limiting such party's obligations under this sentence and (y) as necessary to
reasonably preserve attorney-client privilege or to comply with applicable Law; provided, however, that such materials shall be provided in unredacted form to the receiving party's outside
counsel representing such party before such Governmental Entity. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control, direct or
interfere with the operations of the Company prior to the Effective Time.

                            (g)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with respect to the Merger or the
other Transactions, other than filing fees required to be paid in connection with a filing under any applicable Antitrust Laws, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur
any Liability or other obligation due to such Person, and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being
solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any Liability or other obligation.

                            (h)         Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not extend any applicable waiting period under any Antitrust Law or enter into an agreement with any Governmental

                            (i)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates to proffer to, agree to or actually (and none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall, without the prior written consent of Parent, proffer to, agree to or actually) (i) divest,
hold separate (including by establishing a trust), or enter into any license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or similar agreement with respect to, or agree to restrict the

any manner the ability of such entities to conduct, own, operate or control their respective businesses, assets or properties or of the businesses, properties or assets of the Company and the

litigation of any Action brought by any Governmental Entity or appeal any Order (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, delay materially or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or
prohibit the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions or seeking to obtain from Parent or any of its Affiliates any damages in connection therewith, or (ii) seeking to

                            (k)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, Parent or any of its Affiliates from developing,
soliciting, considering, communicating, exchanging or furnishing information, negotiating, disclosing, entering into or consummating potential or definitive strategic transactions through both
internally generated and third party proposals.

                            (l)          The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or compromise of any Action against the Company and/or its directors
relating to the Transactions and will obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such Action. For purposes of this paragraph "participate" means that Parent will
be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the Action by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its
counsel is not breached), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to the Action but will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over the Action or
investigation, except for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

Section 7.01, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other party of the occurrence of any event that is reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions to each party's
obligations or the other party's obligations set forth in Article VI not to be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.05 shall not cure any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

              Section 5.06  Public Announcements.    Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions (including any
communication required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 14a-12 promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall be issued by any party or its parent company or Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or

make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the initial press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release of, and shall not be issued prior to
the approval of each of, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.06, (i) Parent, the Parent Representatives, the

inconsistent with previous press releases or announcements made by Parent and/or the Company in compliance with this Section 5.06, (ii) the Company may make communications to its
employees in compliance with Section 5.07(a), (iii) Parent, the Parent Representatives, the Company and the Company Representatives and Parent's and the Company's respective Subsidiaries
may make public statements in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such
statements are not materially inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Company and Parent and do not reveal material, non-public
information regarding the other parties, the Merger or the other Transactions and (iv) the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.06 shall not apply to any release or announcement made or
proposed to be made in connection with, or in response to, a Change of Board Recommendation that is effected in compliance with Section 5.03.

              Section 5.07  Employee Benefit Matters.

                            (a)         With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in which any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the "Company Employees") will participate effective as of or after the Effective Time (collectively, "New Plans"), subject to applicable
Law and applicable Tax qualification requirements, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company Employees in the United States with the
Company or a Company Subsidiary that is reflected in the books and records of the Company, as the case may be, for vesting, eligibility and level of benefits purposes (but not for accrual
purposes, except for vacation and severance, if applicable) in any New Plan in which such Company Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, in each case except to the
extent that recognizing such service would result in a duplication of benefits. To the extent any Company Employee in the United States participates in a New Plan that is a welfare plan or
arrangement of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary following the Closing Date (a "Parent Welfare Plan"), Parent and any Parent Subsidiary will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and any
insurer or service provider under the applicable Parent Welfare Plan, cause all (i) pre-existing condition limitations which otherwise would be applicable to such Company Employee and his or
her covered dependents to be waived to the extent satisfied under a Company Benefit Plan comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later,
immediately prior to such Company Employee's commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare Plan, (ii) participation waiting periods under each Parent Welfare Plan that would
otherwise be applicable to such Company Employee to be waived to the same extent waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan immediately

cash-settled equity based incentive opportunities) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate than the U.S. Continuing Employees were eligible to earn from the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

                            (c)          The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall provide Parent with a copy of any written communication to be broadly disseminated to employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to the Transactions or regarding compensation, benefits or other treatment they will receive in connection with or following the Merger, and will
include any reasonable comments from Parent to such communication that Parent makes in good faith within two Business Days after Parent's receipt of such communication (unless such
communication is substantively similar to such prior communications that have been initially made after such announcement of the Merger or prior communications that have been previously
provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.07(c)). The Company shall not disseminate such written communication to employees of the Company or Company Subsidiary until the earlier of
(x) Parent's express consent to such dissemination or (y) two Business Days after the Company has provided Parent with a copy of such written communication.

                            (d)         Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to effect such actions
relating to the 401(k) plan of the Company (the "401(k) Plan"), including amending and/or terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan and
applicable Law and provided that such action does not preclude the immediate participation of the Company Employees in any successor 401(k) plan.

                            (e)         This Section 5.07 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.07, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.07. Nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 5.07 or (iii) require Parent or any of its Affiliates to
(A) maintain any particular Company Benefit Plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee.

              Section 5.08  Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

                            (a)         For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and each Company Subsidiary, as applicable, shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified
Persons") to the same extent such individuals are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, the
corresponding organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries and indemnification agreements, in each case as in existence on the date of this Agreement and listed in Section 3.13(a)
(xxix) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "D&O Indemnification Agreements"), arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the
Company and such Company Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) advance expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Actions with respect to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.08(a) in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, and the corresponding organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries and indemnification agreements, in
each case in existence on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the individual to whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to the extent required by the DGCL or by the
applicable indemnification agreement or organizational document, to repay such advanced expenses to the Surviving Corporation if it is ultimately determined that such

director, officer or employee is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law or pursuant to the applicable indemnification agreement or organizational document.

                            (b)         For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors, officers and employees of the Company for
periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the D&O Indemnification
Agreements shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

                            (c)           Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall bind and purchase directors and officers runoff insurance coverage (the "D&O Runoff Insurance"), which by its
terms shall survive the Merger for not less than six years for the benefit of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Company's and any Company Subsidiary's past and present directors
and/or officers that are insured under the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The D&O Runoff Insurance shall
provide coverage for the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and such individuals in their capacity as directors, officers and/or employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior
to the Effective Time that is not less favorable in the aggregate than the Company's existing directors and officers policy (true and complete copies of which have been made available to
Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the D&O Runoff Insurance in full force and
effect and continue to honor the obligations thereunder for a period of six years after the Effective Time or, if such policies are terminated or cancelled during such six-year period, obtain
(subject to the limitations set forth in the next sentence) alternative D&O Runoff Insurance on substantially similar terms as set forth in this Section 5.08(c). Neither the Company nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O Runoff Insurance in excess of 250% (the "Maximum Amount") of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that in the event the cost of such D&O Runoff Insurance exceeds the Maximum Amount, in the aggregate, the Company shall remain
obligated to provide, and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to maintain, the broadest D&O Runoff Insurance coverage as may be obtained for the Maximum Amount). The
Company and Indemnified Persons may be required to make reasonable application and provide reasonable and customary representations and warranties to applicable insurance carriers for
the purpose of obtaining such D&O Runoff Insurance. Parent shall upon written request furnish a copy of such insurance policy to each beneficiary of such policy.

                            (d)         In the event the Surviving Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries or their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and
are not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of their properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision
shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.08, without
relieving Parent of its obligations under this Section 5.08.

                            (e)         The obligations under this Section 5.08 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect any indemnitee to whom
this Section 5.08 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 5.08 applies shall be (if the Closing occurs) third
party beneficiaries of this Section 5.08).

others having material business relationships with the Company, the status of ongoing operations and other matters relating to the Company's business as reasonably requested by Parent.

                              (b)          No such discussion contemplated by this Section 5.11 shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies
with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

               Section 5.12  Rights Agreement.    From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Section 7.01, the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any stockholder rights agreement, rights plan, "poison pill" or other similar agreement, unless
such plan or agreement exempts from its application this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger.

               Section 5.13  Further Action.    In case at any time prior to the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to vest the Surviving Corporation following the Effective
Time with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and
their respective Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

               Section 8.12  Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury.

thereof, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Action (whether for breach of
contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise) in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery
shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of

which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered using Electronic Delivery shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original executed counterpart and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto shall raise the
use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense
to the formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent that such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity and (b) the parties shall waive, in any Action
for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law. A party's pursuit of specific performance at any time shall not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right
to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for Liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by such party in the case of a
breach of this Agreement involving fraud or willful or intentional misconduct.

               Section 8.15  Guaranty.

                              (a)           To induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, SAP SE, a European Company (Societas Europaea) established under the laws of Germany and the European
Union ("Guarantor"), intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Company the due and punctual payment and performance of
(i) Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations under this Agreement, including any liabilities arising out of a breach thereof (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"). This guarantee may not be
revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and effect without interruption and shall be binding on Guarantor and its successors and assigns until the Guaranteed Obligations have been
satisfied in full. Guarantor further covenants and agrees that, if requested by the Company, it will promptly appoint in accordance with applicable Law a registered agent for service of process
in the State of Delaware, and Guarantor shall maintain such registered agent as its agent for service of process in the State of Delaware without interruption until the Effective Time.

                              (b)          All payments pursuant to this Section 8.15 shall be made in lawful money of the United States, in immediately available funds. Guarantor promises and undertakes
to make all payments hereunder free and clear of any deduction, offset, defense, claim or counterclaim of Guarantor of any kind.

                              (c)           The guaranty set forth in Section 8.15(a) (the "Guaranty") is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guarantee of the full and punctual payment and
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of the Guaranteed Obligations and not of collection. Should Parent or Merger Sub default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall become immediately due and payable to the Company or, if and only if the Effective Time occurs and to the extent that such obligations
become due and payable thereafter, to the former holders of Shares, Company Options or Shares subject to RSU Awards or PSU Awards. Claims hereunder may be made on one or more
occasions. If any payment in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect
to such Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not been made.

                              (d)          Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or delay on the part
of the Company to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations or rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or any agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) the addition, substitution or release of any Person
interested in the Transactions; (iv) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent or Merger Sub; (v) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting Parent or Merger Sub or their assets; (vi) the adequacy of any means the Company may have of obtaining payment related to the Guaranteed Obligations; or (vii) the
existence of any claim, set-off or other right which Parent or Merger Sub may have at any time against the Company (other than satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligations or rights of Merger
Sub pursuant to this Agreement), whether in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Guarantor waives promptness, diligence,

the Guaranteed Obligations that are available to Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement (other than, in each case, fraud, willful misconduct and intentional misrepresentation by the
Company or any of its Affiliates) and defenses available to Guarantor under the Guaranty. Guarantor acknowledges that it has received and will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits
from the Transactions and that the waivers set forth in this Section 8.15 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

                              (e)           No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power pursuant to this Section 8.15 shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company of any right, remedy or power pursuant to this Section 8.15 preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power
pursuant to this Section 8.15. Each and every right, remedy and power granted to the Company pursuant to this Section 8.15 or allowed it by Law or agreement with respect to this Section 8.15
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time. The Company shall not have any obligation to proceed at any time
or in any manner against, exhaust any or all of the Company's rights against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person liable for any Guaranteed Obligations prior to proceeding against
Guarantor hereunder or resort to any security or other means of collecting payment. This Guaranty may only be amended by a writing signed and delivered by Guarantor and the Company.
Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its respective Affiliates not to institute, any Action asserting that the Guaranty is illegal, invalid or
unenforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally, and general equitable principles (whether considered an Action in equity or at law).

                              (f)           Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Company and covenants that: (i) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been duly
authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of Guarantor's organizational documents or any Law or contractual restriction binding on Guarantor or its assets; (ii) this
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency (including all Laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to the effect of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether considered in an Action at law or in equity), (iii) nothing in this Agreement will terminate its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement and (iv) Guarantor
will not issue any press release or other communication in contravention of Section 5.06.

                              (g)           Nothing in this Section 8.15 shall waive any defenses, counterclaims or rights of setoff that Parent or Merger Sub may have under this Agreement or applicable
Law.

ANNEX B

January 29, 2018

Board of Directors
Callidus Software Inc.
4140 Dublin Boulevard, Suite 400
Dublin, California 94568

Members of the Board:

              We understand that Callidus Software Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), SAP America, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and Emerson One Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 29, 2018 (the "Merger Agreement"),
pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue as the
surviving corporation (the "Merger"). Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and each outstanding share of common stock of the Company,
par value $0.001 per share ("Company Common Stock"), other than shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any subsidiary of the Company that is directly or
indirectly wholly-owned by the Company, shares owned of record by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries and shares as to which
appraisal rights have been properly demanded, will be converted into the right to receive, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, $36.00 in cash, without interest
(the "Merger Consideration"). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

              You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Merger Agreement by the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, other than Parent or any affiliates of Parent (the "Holders") is fair, from a financial point of view, to such Holders.

              For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have reviewed the Merger Agreement, certain related documents, and certain publicly available financial statements and other business
and financial information of the Company. We have also reviewed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company prepared by management of the Company, including financial
projections and operating data prepared by management of the Company (collectively, the "Company Projections"). Additionally, we discussed the past and current operations and financial
condition and the prospects of the Company with senior executives of the Company. We also reviewed historical market prices and trading activity for Company Common Stock and compared
the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock with that of certain other selected publicly-traded companies and their securities. In
addition, we reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of selected acquisition transactions and performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and
considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.

              In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or
supplied or otherwise made

available to, or discussed with, us by the Company. With respect to the Company Projections, we have been advised by the management of the Company, and have assumed, that they have
been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the capitalization and future financial performance of
the Company and other matters covered thereby. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without any
modification, waiver or delay. In addition, we have assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or
restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company or Parent or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Transaction. We have not made
any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, we
have relied, without independent verification, upon the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing and future technology and products of the Company and the risks
associated with such technology and products.

              We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will receive a fee for our services payable upon rendering of this
opinion. We will also receive an additional, larger fee if the Merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities
arising out of our engagement. During the two year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship existed between Qatalyst or any of its affiliates and the Company or Parent pursuant
to which compensation was received by Qatalyst or its affiliates; however, Qatalyst and/or its affiliates may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the
Company or Parent and their respective affiliates for which we or they would expect to receive compensation.

              Qatalyst provides investment banking and other services to a wide range of entities and individuals, domestically and offshore, from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. In
the ordinary course of these activities, affiliates of Qatalyst may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions in debt or equity securities or loans of
the Company, Parent or certain of their respective affiliates.

              This opinion has been approved by our opinion committee in accordance with our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company
and may not be used for any other purpose without our prior written consent. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any Holder should vote with respect to the Merger
or any other matter and does not in any manner address the prices at which Company Common Stock will trade at any time.

              Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring
after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion does not
address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the
Company. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be received by the Holders pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the
Merger Agreement and we express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount, nature or timing of the compensation to any of the Company's officers, directors or employees, or any
class of such persons, relative to such Merger Consideration.

              Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Merger Consideration to be received by the Holders pursuant to, and in accordance with, the

ANNEX C

SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE 

§ 262 Appraisal rights 

              (a)         Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such
shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted
in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the
stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a
corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

              (b)         Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other
than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this
title:

                            (1)         Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or
series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon
the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights
shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation
as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

                            (2)          Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent
corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for
such stock anything except:

                                            a.           Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

                                            b.           Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or
depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

                                            c.            Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

                                            d.           Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing
paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

                            (3)         In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the parent
immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

                            (4)         In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated
by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment"
substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting corporation."

              (c)          Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a
result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as
nearly as is practicable.

              (d)         Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

                            (1)         If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice
in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any
or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of
this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written
demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action
must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each
stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or
consolidation has become effective; or

                            (2)         If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of
the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who
are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given
on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights
may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated
by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand
will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends

thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent
corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that
are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within
10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant
to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need
only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or
assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the
facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than
10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no
record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

              (e)         Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and
(d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of
the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon
the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of
shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written
statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days
after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is
the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from the
corporation the statement described in this subsection.

              (f)          Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after
such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded
payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving
or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be
given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the
Court deems

advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

              (g)         At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court
may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If
immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national
securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to
appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of
shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

              (h)         After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum
of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon
application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal
prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

              (i)          The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto.
Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to
the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting
corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

              (j)          The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder,
the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

              (k)         From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be
entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a
date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this
section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or
consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation,
then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without
the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder
