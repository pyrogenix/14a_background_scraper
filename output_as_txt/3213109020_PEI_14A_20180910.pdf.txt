PERRY ELLIS INTERNATIONAL, INC.
3000 N.W. 107th Avenue

Miami, Florida 33172

September 10, 2018

Dear Shareholder:

        You are cordially invited to attend a Special Meeting of the shareholders (the "Special Meeting") of Perry Ellis International, Inc. ("Perry Ellis" or the "Company"), which
will be held at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on Thursday, October 18, 2018 at 3000 N.W. 107th Avenue, Miami, Florida, 33172. The Special Meeting is being held for the following
purposes, as more fully described in the accompanying Proxy Statement:

1. To hold a vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 15, 2018 (as it may be amended, the "merger agreement"), by and
among the Company, Feldenkreis Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Parent"), and GF Merger Sub, Inc., a Florida corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "merger"), with the Company
surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent; 

2. To hold an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve certain items of compensation that are based on or otherwise related to the merger that may become payable to
the Company's named executive officers under existing agreements with the Company (the "golden parachute compensation"); and 

3. To hold a vote on a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of
the Special Meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

        If the merger is completed, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") that you own immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, other than as provided below, will be converted into the right to receive $27.50 in cash (the "per share merger consideration"), without interest and
less applicable withholding taxes. The following shares of Company Common Stock will not be converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration in
connection with the merger: (i) shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries, (ii) shares of
Company Common Stock held by George Feldenkreis, Oscar Feldenkreis and certain other related investors (the "Rollover Investors"), and (iii) shares of Company Common
Stock whose holders have not voted in favor of adopting the merger agreement and have demanded and perfected their appraisal rights in accordance with, and have complied in
all respects with, the Florida Business Corporation Act. Following the completion of the merger, Parent will own all of the Company's issued and outstanding capital stock and
the Company will continue its operations as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result, the Company will no longer have Company Common Stock listed on the Nasdaq
Global Market and will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to Company Common Stock. After the
merger, you will no longer have an equity interest in the Company and will not participate in any potential future earnings of the Company.

        The Rollover Investors have also entered into a voting agreement with Parent and the Company that covers an aggregate of approximately 19.8% of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock, pursuant to which, unless the voting agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms (including upon a termination of the merger agreement in
accordance with its terms), the Rollover Investors have agreed to, among other things, vote, or cause to be voted, their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement and approval of any related proposal in furtherance of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Moreover,
adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will require the affirmative vote of the holders of (i) a majority of the outstanding
shares of the Company

Common Stock entitled to vote thereon as of the record date for the Special Meeting; and (ii) a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock entitled to vote
thereon as of the record date for the Special Meeting that are not owned by: (x) officers or directors of the Company, (y) the Rollover Investors, or (z) any person having any
equity interest in Parent or Merger Sub.

        The Rollover Investors have committed to contribute, in the aggregate, approximately 19.8% of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger to Parent in exchange for a pro rata share of the equity of Parent based on a value of each share of Company Common Stock so contributed of $27.50.

        The board of directors formed a special committee comprised entirely of independent and disinterested directors (the "Special Committee") to consider and negotiate the
terms and conditions of the merger and to recommend to the board of directors whether to pursue the merger and, if so, on what terms and conditions.

        The Special Committee, after careful consideration, voted unanimously to recommend to the board of directors that it, and thereafter the board of directors, after
careful consideration and acknowledging the interest of George Feldenkreis and Oscar Feldenkreis in the merger, voted unanimously to (i) approve and declare
advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) declare that it is fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and our unaffiliated shareholders that the Company enter into the merger agreement and consummate the merger on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the merger agreement, (iii) direct that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the shareholders of the Company and
(iv) recommend to the shareholders of the Company that they vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement. In arriving at its recommendations, the board of directors
and Special Committee carefully considered a number of factors described in the accompanying Proxy Statement.

        The Special Committee and the board of directors also recommend that you vote FOR the advisory (non-binding) approval of the "golden parachute
compensation" and FOR the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of
the Special Meeting to adopt the merger agreement. Adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the "golden parachute compensation" are subject to separate votes by
the Company's shareholders, and approval of the "golden parachute compensation" is not a condition to the completion of the merger.

        In considering the recommendation of the board of directors, you should be aware that certain of the Company's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger
that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally as further described in the accompanying Proxy Statement. You should also be aware that the
Rollover Investors have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company's other shareholders, as further described in the
accompanying Proxy Statement.

        Any holder of Company Common Stock who does not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of such
holder's shares of Company Common Stock if the merger is completed in lieu of receiving the per share merger consideration, but only if such holder does not vote in favor of
adopting the merger agreement and otherwise complies with the procedures of Sections 607.1301 through 607.1333 of the Florida Business Corporations Act (the "FBCA"),
which is the appraisal rights statute applicable to Florida corporations. These appraisal rights are summarized in the accompanying Proxy Statement. The accompanying Proxy
Statement constitutes notice to you from the Company of the availability of appraisal rights under the FBCA.

        Your vote is important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure the presence of a quorum and that your shares are represented
at the Special Meeting, please vote via the Internet or by telephone as instructed in the accompanying proxy materials or complete, date and sign and return a proxy
card as promptly as possible. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting, please take advantage of one of the advance voting options to ensure that your shares are

represented at the Special Meeting. You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by following the procedures described in the accompanying Proxy Statement. The
merger cannot be completed unless the merger is adopted by an affirmative vote of: (i) holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock
entitled to vote thereon as of the record date for the Special Meeting; and (ii) holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock entitled to
vote thereon as of the record date for the Special Meeting that are not owned by: (x) officers or directors of the Company, (y) the Rollover Investors, or (z) any person
having any equity interest in Parent or Merger Sub.

        Thank you for your continued support.

        Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved the merger, passed upon the merits or
fairness of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, including the proposed merger, or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the
information contained in this document or the accompanying Proxy Statement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

        The accompanying Proxy Statement is dated September 10, 2018 and is first being mailed to the Company's shareholders on or about September 11, 2018.

  Sincerely,

which is the appraisal rights statute applicable to Florida corporations. These appraisal rights are summarized in the accompanying Proxy Statement. The accompanying Proxy

• Purpose of Shareholders' Vote.  You are being asked to: 

• consider and vote upon a proposal (the "merger proposal") to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 15, 2018, by and among the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as it may be amended from time to time (the "merger agreement"). A copy of the merger agreement is attached as
Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "merger"), and the
Company will continue as the surviving corporation and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. If the merger is completed, each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), other than as provided below, will be
converted into the right to receive $27.50 in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes (the "per share merger consideration"). The
following shares of Company Common Stock will not be converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration in connection with the
merger: (i) shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its wholly-owned

subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries, (ii) shares of Company Common Stock held by the Rollover Investors, which will be contributed to Parent by the
Rollover Investors pursuant to their respective rollover commitment letters (the "Rollover Letters") under which, and subject to the terms and conditions of
which, the Rollover Investors have committed to contribute to Parent the amount of shares of Company Common Stock set forth therein (the "Rollover
Investment"), and (iii) shares of Company Common Stock whose holders have not voted in favor of adopting the merger agreement and have demanded
and perfected their appraisal rights in accordance with, and have complied in all respects with, Sections 607.1301 through 607.1333 of the Florida
Business Corporation Act (the "FBCA"). See "Special Factors" beginning on page 18; "The Special Meeting" beginning on page 110; and "The Merger
Agreement—Conversion of Securities" beginning on page 117;

• approve on an advisory (non-binding) basis certain items of compensation that are based on or otherwise related to the merger that may become payable to
the Company's named executive officers under existing agreements with the Company (which is referred to in this Proxy Statement as the "golden

• approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
Special Meeting to adopt the merger agreement. 

• Voting Agreements.  The Rollover Investors have entered into a voting agreement with Parent and the Company that covers an aggregate of approximately
19.8% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, pursuant to which such shareholders have agreed to, among other things, vote, or cause to be voted,
their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and any related proposal in furtherance of the merger and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The voting agreement will terminate automatically at the earliest of (i) the mutual agreement of the parties
thereto to terminate the voting agreement; (ii) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, and (iii) the effective time of the merger. See
"Special Factors—Voting Agreement" beginning on page 91. 

• Rollover Investment.  Pursuant to the Rollover Letters, the Rollover Investors have committed to contribute, immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, approximately 19.8% of the outstanding Company Common Stock to Parent in exchange for a pro rata share of the equity of Parent based on a value for
each share of Company Common Stock so contributed of $27.50. In addition, the Rollover Letter between Parent and George Feldenkreis, in his individual
capacity, provides that George Feldenkreis may be required to contribute up to $5 million in cash to Parent under certain circumstances. 

• Parties Involved in the Merger.  The Company, a Florida corporation headquartered in Miami, Florida, is a global leader in the design, manufacturing, marketing
and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel and accessories. Parent is a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of George Feldenkreis. Merger Sub is

• Conditions to the Merger.  The completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, which are described in "The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 136. These conditions include, among others: 

• the adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of (i) a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled
to vote thereon as of the record date for the Special Meeting and (ii) a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote
thereon as of the record date for the Special Meeting that are not owned directly or indirectly by the Rollover Investors, any other officers or directors of
the Company or any other person having any equity interest in, or right to acquire any equity interest in, Merger Sub or any person of which Merger Sub is
a direct or indirect subsidiary; 

• the expiration or termination of the regulatory waiting period applicable to the consummation of the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act"), which occurred on July 10, 2018; 

• the absence of certain governmental injunctions or orders that enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the merger; 

• the absence of a material adverse effect on the Company; 

• the Company's, Parent's and Merger Sub's performance in all material respects of their agreements and covenants in the merger agreement; and 

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub (subject to certain qualifications). 

• Special Committee and Board Recommendation.  The Special Committee, after careful consideration, voted unanimously to recommend to the board of
directors that it, and thereafter the board of directors, after careful consideration and acknowledging the interest of George Feldenkreis and Oscar Feldenkreis in
the merger, voted unanimously to (i) approve and declare advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
(ii) declare that it is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the unaffiliated shareholders of the Company that the Company enter into the merger

agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the shareholders of the Company and (iv) recommend to the shareholders of the Company that they vote FOR

compensation" and FOR approval of the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes at the time of the Special Meeting to adopt the merger agreement. For purposes of the Rule 13e-3 "going private" transaction described in this Proxy
Statement, and as used in this Proxy Statement, "unaffiliated shareholders" means all shareholders of the Company other than the Rollover Investors. See "Special
Factors—Recommendation of the Special Committee and Our Board of Directors; Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement; Fairness
of the Merger" beginning on page 50 and see "Advisory Vote on "Golden Parachute Compensation"" beginning on page 143. 

• Opinion of the Special Committee's Financial Advisor. In connection with the merger, the Special Committee received a written opinion, dated June 15, 2018,
from the Special Committee's financial advisor, PJ Solomon Securities, LLC ("PJS" or "PJ Solomon"), as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of
the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, of the $27.50 in cash per share to be

paid to the shareholders (other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement. The full text of PJS' written opinion, which sets forth assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached to this Proxy Statement as
Appendix B. PJS provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the Special Committee in connection with its consideration of the merger. The
opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to how any such shareholder should vote on the merger or act on any matter
relating to the merger.

• Financing of the Merger.  Parent and Merger Sub have obtained debt financing commitments for the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the
aggregate proceeds of which, together with the Rollover Investment and other funds available to Parent, are expected to be sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to
pay the aggregate merger consideration and the related fees and expenses of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The consummation of the
merger is not subject to any financing conditions (although funding of the debt financing is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the commitment
letters under which the financing will be provided). See "Special Factors—Financing of the Merger" beginning on page 78. 

• Limited Guarantee.  In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, George Feldenkreis has executed and provided the Company with a limited non-
recourse guarantee in favor of the Company to guarantee, subject to the limitations described therein, the payment of certain monetary obligations that may be
owed by Parent pursuant to the merger agreement, including the payment of any reverse termination fee that may become payable by Parent following a
termination of the merger agreement in specified circumstances, subject to an overall cap of $17.472 million. See "Special Factors—Limited Guarantee"
beginning on page 82. 

• Pledge and Security Agreement.  In connection with the execution of the merger agreement and limited guarantee, George Feldenkreis has provided the
Company with a pledge and security agreement in favor of the Company pledging an aggregate of 647,451 certificated shares of Company Common Stock as the
sole and exclusive recourse for his obligations under the limited guarantee. The pledged certificated shares of Company Common Stock are held in an escrow
account maintained by Citibank, National Association under the control of the Special Committee. See "Special Factors—Pledge and Security Agreement"
beginning on page 83. 

• Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.  In considering the recommendation of the board of directors, you should be
aware that certain of the Company's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, their interests as
Company shareholders. George Feldenkreis, a member of the board of directors, and Oscar Feldenkreis, the chief executive officer and member of the board of
directors, are members of the GF Group and will have equity interests in Parent after the consummation of the merger. These interests may create conflicts of
interest. The Special Committee and the board of directors were aware of these interests during their respective deliberations on the merits of the merger and in
making their decisions to recommend and approve, respectively, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the
merger. These interests are discussed in "Special Factors—Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 83,
"Advisory Vote on "Golden Parachute Compensation"" beginning on page 143.

• Interests of Other Shareholders in the Merger.  In considering the recommendation of the board of directors, you should be aware that the Rollover Investors
have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company's other shareholders. The Rollover Investors will have equity
interests in Parent after the consummation of the merger. These interests may create conflicts of interest. The Special Committee and the board of directors were
aware of these interests during their respective deliberations on the merits of the merger and in making their decisions to recommend and approve, respectively,
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger. These interests are discussed in "Special Factors—
Positions of the GF Group Filing Persons Regarding the Fairness of the Merger" beginning on page 67. 

• Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.  The exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for cash pursuant to the merger
generally will be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled "Special Factors—Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 95) whose shares of Company Common Stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger
will generally recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of the cash received
with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of Company
Common Stock (i.e., shares of Company Common Stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). See "Special Factors—Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences" beginning on page 95 for a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to certain U.S. holders and certain
non-U.S. holders. The determination of the actual tax consequences of the merger to a holder of Company Common Stock will depend on the holder's specific
situation. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to them based on their particular
circumstance, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. 

• Treatment of Outstanding Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock Awards.  In connection with the consummation of the merger, (i) each
stock option and stock appreciation right, whether or not then exercisable or vested, will be converted into the right to receive at the closing cash equal to the
product of (a) the excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration over the per share exercise price of the applicable option or stock appreciation right and
(b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such option or stock appreciation right; (ii) each restricted stock award not subject to any
performance-based vesting condition held by an employee will be automatically vested and converted into the right to receive at the closing cash equal to the
product of (a) the per share merger consideration and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award; (iii) each
restricted stock award not subject to any performance-based vesting condition held by a non-employee member of the board of directors will vest on a prorated
basis based on the number of days that have elapsed since the grant date of such award and be converted into the right to receive at the closing cash equal to the
product of (a) the per share merger consideration and (b) such pro-rated number of shares; and (iv) with the exception of certain management members described
below, each restricted stock award subject to any performance-based vesting condition will be converted into a right to receive a restricted cash award from the
surviving corporation that will vest and be payable (without regard to any performance goals but subject to applicable service vesting conditions in the prior
award) at the end of its currently applicable vesting period, with the cash payment therefor equal to the product of: (a) the per share merger consideration and
(b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award that would have vested based on target level achievement. Such
restricted cash award will accelerate upon a termination without cause or for good reason prior to the

scheduled vesting date. Each restricted stock award subject to any performance-based vesting condition held by Mr. Jorge Narino or Ms. Tricia McDermott
Thompkins will be converted into a right to receive at the closing a cash payment equal to the product of: (a) the per share merger consideration and (b) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award that would have vested based on target level achievement. All outstanding
restricted stock units held by George Feldenkreis will be cancelled. For more details about the treatment of Company equity-based awards, please see the section
entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conversion of Securities—Treatment of Outstanding Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock Awards"
beginning on page 117.

• Anticipated Closing of the Merger.  The merger is expected to be completed after all of the conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived. The Company
currently expects the merger to be completed in the second half of 2018, although the Company cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all. The
Company will issue a press release once the merger has been completed. See "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" beginning
on page 136. 

• Limitations on Solicitations of Other Offers.  The Company has agreed to cease and terminate any previous discussions or negotiations with respect to
"takeover proposals" (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—Covenants of the Company—No Solicitation of Takeover Proposals; Fiduciary Out" beginning on
page 126). Under the merger agreement, the Company is subject to "nonsolicitation" restrictions that prohibit the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective
representatives from soliciting, encouraging or facilitating offers or proposals relating to a takeover proposal or providing information to or engaging in
discussions or negotiations with third parties regarding a takeover proposal. Prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by the Company's shareholders, or the
termination of the merger agreement (whichever occurs earlier), the "nonsolicitation" restrictions are subject to "fiduciary out" provisions. See "The Merger
Agreement—Covenants of the Company—No Solicitation of Takeover Proposals; Fiduciary Out" beginning on page 126 and "The Merger Agreement—Effect of
Termination; Fees and Expenses" beginning on page 139. 

• Termination.  The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the completion of the merger: 

• by mutual written consent of both Parent and the Company (but with respect to the Company, only pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Special
Committee); 

• by either Parent or the Company if (but with respect to the Company, only pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Special Committee): 

• the merger is not consummated by December 14, 2018 (the "termination date"), except that such right to terminate the merger agreement will not
be available to the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement if such party has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements in the merger agreement, which breach has materially contributed to, or resulted in, the failure to consummate the merger by such date;

• the merger agreement has been submitted to the Company's shareholders for adoption at a duly convened shareholders meeting (or adjournment,
postponement or recess thereof) at which a quorum is present and the requisite shareholder vote is not obtained; or 

• a final and nonappealable order of any governmental authority having jurisdiction over any party to the merger agreement permanently enjoins or
prohibits consummation of the merger; provided that the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement must

have used reasonable best efforts to challenge such order and cause such order to be withdrawn, rescinded, terminated, cancelled or otherwise
nullified;

• by Parent if: 

• prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by the Company's shareholders, the Special Committee or the board of directors has changed,
withdrawn, modified or amended its recommendation (or the Special Committee recommends that the board of directors take any such action) that
the Company's shareholders adopt the merger agreement in any manner adverse to Parent (or the Special Committee or the board of directors has
publicly proposed to do so); 

• prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by the Company's shareholders, (i) the board of directors or the Special Committee approves,
endorses or recommends any takeover proposal (or publicly proposes to do so) or (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or securities of the Company then outstanding is commenced
and the board of directors or Special Committee recommends in favor of such tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders (or publicly
proposes to do so) or within ten business days after the commencement thereof the board of directors fails to recommend against such tender offer
or exchange offer; or 

• a breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under the merger agreement has occurred, which
breach would give rise to a failure of certain specified conditions to closing and such breach is not capable of being cured prior to the termination
date or is not cured by the Company within 20 business days after the Company's receipt of written notice of such breach from Parent, but only so
long as neither Parent nor Merger Sub are in breach of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under the merger
agreement which breach would give rise to the failure of specified conditions to the Company's obligations to close; 

• by the Company (only pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Special Committee before the effective time of merger):

Company, but only so long as the Company is not in breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under the merger agreement
which breach would give rise to the failure of specified conditions to Parent's obligations to close; or 

• if (i) all of the conditions to the respective obligations of the parties and to Parent's obligations to close have been satisfied or waived (other than
any condition the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable to a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their respective representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement and other than conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the closing and
which were, at the time of termination, capable of being satisfied), (ii) the

Company confirmed to Parent in writing that all conditions to the Company's obligations to close have been satisfied (or that it is willing to waive
(to the extent permitted by law) any unsatisfied conditions to the Company's obligations to close) and that it stands and will stand ready, willing
and able to consummate the merger and (iii) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the closing by the earlier of (x) the date that is five
business days after receipt of such confirmation by the Company and (y) the termination date.

None of the Rollover Investors (other than George Feldenkreis) or any of their affiliates, partners, members, directors, officers, employees and other specified
persons (i) shall be obligated under, or otherwise have any liability with respect to, any guarantee obligations of George Feldenkreis or any reverse termination fee
payable by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company and/or (ii) will be entitled to receipt of any termination fee payable by the Company to Parent and/or Merger
Sub.

        See "The Merger Agreement—Termination" beginning on page 137.

• Termination Fees.  The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Parent. The merger agreement provides that, upon
termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, the Company would be required to pay Parent or its designee a termination fee in an amount
equal to $8.736 million (including, under certain circumstances, if the Company enters into a definitive agreement for or consummates an alternative takeover
proposal during the 9-month "tail" period following termination of the merger agreement, or under other certain circumstances, during the 12-month "tail" period
following termination of the merger agreement). The merger agreement also provides that Parent would be required to pay the Company a reverse termination fee,
upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, of $17.472 million, and, in certain circumstances, the fees and expenses of the
Company, but subject to an overall cap of $17.472 million. The merger agreement provides that under no circumstances may the Company be permitted or entitled
to receive both payment of the reverse termination fee and payment of other monetary damages. See "The Merger Agreement—Effect of Termination; Fees and
Expenses" beginning on page 139 and "Special Factors—Limited Guarantee" beginning on Page 82. 

• Specific Performance.  Under certain circumstances, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, are entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy at law or in equity to which they are entitled. However, the right of the Company to seek specific performance to enforce Parent's
and/or Merger Sub's obligation to effect the closing as provided by the merger agreement is subject to the requirements that (i) all of the conditions to the parties'
respective obligations and to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the merger would have been satisfied if the closing were to have occurred at
such time (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied at the closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the closing, or the
failure of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in the merger agreement), (ii) the debt financing has been funded or will be funded at the date the closing is required to occur in accordance
with the terms of the merger agreement upon delivery of a drawdown notice by Parent and/or notice from Parent that the Rollover Investment will be funded at
such date, (iii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the closing on the date the closing is required to have occurred as provided in the merger agreement, and
(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that all of the conditions to the parties' respective obligations and to the Company's obligations to
consummate the merger have

been satisfied (or that the Company would be willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions for purposes of consummating the merger) and that if specific
performance is granted and if the debt financing and Rollover Investment were funded, the closing would occur. The merger agreement provides that under no
circumstances may the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to which the merger is
consummated and the aggregate merger consideration is received, on the one hand, and payment of all or a portion of the reverse termination fee or other
monetary damages, on the other hand. See "The Merger Agreement—Effect of Termination; Fees and Expenses" beginning on page 139 and see "Special Factors
—Financing of the Merger" beginning on page 78.

1. A vote on the adoption of the merger agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company and the Company will continue as the
surviving corporation and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent; 

2. An advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the "golden parachute compensation" that may become payable to the Company's named executive officers in
connection with the merger; and 

3. A vote on a proposal to approve the adjournment, postponement or recess of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

In addition, shareholders will be asked to consider and vote upon any other matters that properly come before the Special Meeting or any adjournment, postponement or
recess thereof.

Q:    What will happen in the merger?

A: In the merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation and become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the merger, Company Common Stock will no longer be publicly traded, and you will no longer have any interest in the Company's
future earnings or growth. In addition, Company Common Stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the Company will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to Company Common Stock.

Q:    What will I receive in the merger?

A: If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $27.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Company Common
Stock that you own immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. For example, if you own 100 shares of Company Common Stock, you will receive $2,750.00 in
cash in exchange for your shares of Company Common Stock, without giving effect to any applicable withholding taxes. This does not apply to (i) shares of Company
Common Stock held by the Company or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries, (ii) shares of Company Common Stock held by the Rollover
Investors, and (iii) shares of Company Common Stock whose holders have not voted in favor of adopting the merger agreement and have demanded and perfected their
appraisal rights in

accordance with, and have complied in all respects with, the FBCA. You will not own, directly or indirectly, any shares of the capital stock in the surviving corporation.

In connection with the consummation of the merger, (i) each stock option and stock appreciation right, whether or not then exercisable or vested, will be converted into
the right to receive at the closing cash equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price of the applicable option
or stock appreciation right and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such option or stock appreciation right; (ii) each restricted stock award
not subject to any performance-based vesting condition held by an employee will be automatically vested and converted into the right to receive at the closing cash equal
to the product of (a) the per share merger consideration and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award; (iii) each
restricted stock award not subject to any performance-based vesting condition held by a non-employee member of the board of directors will vest on a prorated basis
based on the number of days that have elapsed since the grant date of such award and be converted into the right to receive at the closing cash equal to the product of
(a) the per share merger consideration and (b) such pro-rated number of shares; and (iv) with the exception of certain management members described below, each
restricted stock award subject to any performance-based vesting condition will be converted into a right to receive a restricted cash award from the surviving corporation
that will vest and be payable (without regard to any performance goals but subject to applicable service vesting conditions in the prior award) at the end of its currently
applicable vesting period, with the cash payment therefor equal to the product of: (a) the per share merger consideration and (b) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award that would have vested based on target level achievement. Such restricted cash award will accelerate upon a
termination without cause or for good reason prior to the scheduled vesting date. Each restricted stock award subject to any performance-based vesting condition held by
Mr. Jorge Narino or Ms. Tricia McDermott Thompkins will be converted into a right to receive at the closing a cash payment equal to the product of: (a) the per share
merger consideration and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award that would have vested based on target level
achievement.

Q:    How does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of Company Common Stock prior to announcement of the merger?

A: The $27.50 per share to be paid in respect of each share of Company Common Stock represents (i) a premium of 21.6% based on the closing price per share of Company
Common Stock on February 5, 2018 (the "Undisturbed Date"), the last trading day before the announcement by George Feldenkreis of a proposal to acquire the Company,
of $22.62; (ii) a premium of 26.22% based on the volume weighted average price per share of Company Common Stock for the 1-year period ending on the Undisturbed
Date, of $21.79; (iii) a premium of 25.6% based on the volume weighted average price per share of Company Common Stock for the 180-day period ending on the
Undisturbed Date, of $21.90; (iv) a premium of 14.0% based on the volume weighted average price per share of Company Common Stock for the 90-day period ending
on the Undisturbed Date, of $24.13; (v) a premium of 11.1% based on the volume weighted average price per share of Company Common Stock for the 60-day period
ending on the Undisturbed Date, of $24.75; (vi) a premium of 9.4% based on the volume weighted average price per share of Company Common Stock for the 30-day
period ending on the Undisturbed Date, of $25.14; (vii) a premium of 5.8% based on the highest closing price per share of Company Common Stock for the 52-week
period ending on the Undisturbed Date, of $25.99; and (viii) a discount of 4.5% based on the highest closing price per share of Company Common Stock for the 5-year
period ending on the Undisturbed Date, of $28.80.

Q:    How will our directors and executive officers vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement?

A: Our directors and executive officers have informed us that, as of the date of this Proxy Statement, they intend to vote all of the shares of Company Common Stock owned
directly by them, in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of August 16, 2018, the record date for the Special Meeting, our directors and executive officers
(including George Feldenkreis and Oscar Feldenkreis) directly owned, in the aggregate, 3,291,772 shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting, or collectively approximately 20.7% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. As of August 16, 2018, the
record date for the Special Meeting, our directors and executive officers that are not party to the voting agreement (as described in "Special Factors—Voting Agreement"
beginning on page 91) directly owned, in the aggregate, 351,580 shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or collectively
approximately 2.2% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. See "Special Factors—Interests of the Company's
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 83.

Q:    Who will own the Company after the merger?

A: After the merger, the Company will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Immediately following the merger, George Feldenkreis, Oscar Feldenkreis and the other
Rollover Investors will own 100% of the equity securities of Parent.

Q:    Who can attend and vote at the Special Meeting?

A: All holders of Company Common Stock at the close of business on August 16, 2018, the record date for the Special Meeting, will be entitled to vote (in person or by
proxy) at the Special Meeting.

Q:    What vote is required to adopt the merger agreement?

A: The merger agreement must be adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of (i) a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote
thereon, and (ii) a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon that are not owned directly or indirectly by the Rollover
Investors, any other officers or directors of the Company or any other person having any equity interest in, or right to acquire any equity interest in, Merger Sub or any
person of which merger Sub is a direct or indirect subsidiary. Because the required vote is based on the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding rather
than on the number of votes cast, failure to vote your shares (including as a result of broker non-votes) and abstentions will have the same effect as voting against the
adoption of the merger agreement. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker does not have discretion to vote on the matter and has not received instructions from the
beneficial holder as to how such holder's shares are to be voted on the matter. Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure the
presence of a quorum and that your shares are represented at the Special Meeting, please vote via the Internet or by telephone as instructed in the
accompanying proxy materials or complete, date and sign and return a proxy card as promptly as possible.

The Rollover Investors have entered into a voting agreement with Parent and the Company that covers an aggregate of approximately 19.8% of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, pursuant to which such shareholders have agreed to, among other things, vote their shares FOR the adoption of the merger agreement and the
approval of the merger and any related proposal in furtherance of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Q:    Why am I being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve "golden parachute compensation" that may become payable to the Company's named
executive officers under existing agreements with the Company in connection with the merger?

A: The SEC has adopted rules that require the Company to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain compensation that will or may be payable to the
Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger.

Q:    What is the "golden parachute compensation"?

A: The "golden parachute compensation" is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the consummation of the merger and may become payable to the Company's
named executive officers under existing agreements with the Company. See "Advisory Vote on "Golden Parachute Compensation" " beginning on page 143.

Q:    What vote is required to approve on an advisory basis the "golden parachute compensation" that may become payable to the Company's named executive officers
under existing agreements with the Company in connection with the merger?

A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal is required for approval of the
advisory (non-binding) proposal on "golden parachute compensation."

Q:    What will happen if shareholders do not approve the "golden parachute compensation" at the Special Meeting?

A: Approval of the "golden parachute compensation" is not a condition to the completion of the merger. The vote with respect to the "golden parachute compensation" is
merely an advisory vote and will not be binding on the Company or Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their
terms, subject to shareholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote, if the merger agreement is adopted by the shareholders
and completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the various "golden parachute" payments.

Q:    What is a quorum?

A: A quorum will be present if holders of a majority in voting power of all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote on a matter at the Special Meeting
are present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. The quorum for the Special Meeting is not broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any shareholder.
If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, the Special Meeting may be adjourned to another time and place.

Q:    How many votes do I have?

A: You have one vote for each share of Company Common Stock that you own as of the close of business on the record date.

Q:    How are votes counted and what happens if I do not vote?

A: Votes will be counted separately in respect of each proposal by the inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting, who will separately count FOR and
AGAINST votes, abstentions and broker non-votes. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not receive instructions from
the beneficial owner with respect to the merger proposal, the proposal for "golden parachute compensation" or the adjournment proposal, counted separately.

Because Florida law requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to approve the adoption of the merger
agreement, the failure

to vote, broker non-votes and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the adoption of the merger agreement.

Because the advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the "golden parachute compensation" and approval of the adjournment proposal require the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock, present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, abstentions will have the same
effect as a vote AGAINST each of the "golden parachute compensation" and adjournment proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of each of the
"golden parachute compensation" proposal and the adjournment proposal. As noted above, the vote with respect to the "golden parachute compensation" is merely an
advisory vote and will not be binding on the Company or Parent. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote, if the merger agreement is
adopted by the shareholders and completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the various "golden parachute" payments.

Adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will require the affirmative vote of the holders of (i) a majority of the
outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon as of the record date for the Special Meeting; and (ii) a majority of the outstanding shares of
the Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon as of the record date for the Special Meeting that are not owned by: (x) officers or directors of the Company, (y) the
Rollover Investors, or (z) any person having any equity interest in Parent or Merger Sub.

Q:    How do I vote my Company Common Stock?

A: Before you vote, you should read this Proxy Statement carefully and in its entirety, including the appendices, and carefully consider how the merger and the "golden
parachute compensation" affect you. Then, mail your completed, dated and signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope or vote via Internet or by telephone as soon
as possible so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. For more information on how to vote your shares, see "The Special Meeting—How Do I Vote?"
beginning on page 111.

Q:    If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker, bank or other nominee vote my shares for me?

A: Your broker will not vote your shares on your behalf unless you provide instructions to your broker on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided by your
broker regarding how to instruct it to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as voting AGAINST the
adoption of the merger agreement for purposes of the Company shareholder approval, but will have no effect for purposes of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting,
if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies or on the outcome of the advisory (non-binding) vote on "golden parachute compensation."

Q:    Will my shares held in "street name" or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?

A: No. Because any shares you may hold in "street name" will be deemed to be held by a different shareholder than any shares you hold of record, any shares so held will not
be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a
trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of
record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or business entity may be voted by the officer, agent or proxy designated by the bylaws of such corporate shareholder or,
in the absence of any applicable bylaw, by such person or persons as the board of directors of the corporate shareholder may designate. In the absence of any such
designation, or, in case of

conflicting designation by the corporate shareholder, the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the secretary and the treasurer of the corporate
shareholder, in that order, shall be presumed to be fully authorized to vote such shares. Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian, personal representative, or
conservator may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into his name. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by
him, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by him without a transfer of such shares into his name or the name of his nominee.
Shares held by or under the control of a receiver, a trustee in bankruptcy proceedings, or an assignee for the benefit of creditors may be voted by such person without the
transfer thereof into his name. If shares stand of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in
common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or if two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary of the
Company is given notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided,
then acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: (a) if only one votes, in person or by proxy, his act binds all; (b) if more than one votes, in person or by
proxy, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one votes, in person or by proxy, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction is
entitled to vote the share or shares in question proportionally; or (d) if the instrument or order so filed shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interest, a majority
or a vote evenly split for purposes hereof shall be a majority or a vote evenly split in interest.

Q:    May I vote in person?

A: Yes. You may attend the Special Meeting and vote your shares in person whether or not you sign and return your proxy card. If your shares are held of record by a broker,
bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the Special Meeting, you must obtain a proxy from such record holder.

Q:    May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?

A: Yes. If you are the shareholder of record of your shares, you may revoke your proxy in any one of three ways: 

• You may submit another properly completed proxy bearing a later date, or submit another proxy by Internet or telephone, which is received by Innisfree M&A
Incorporated, our proxy solicitor, before the start of the Special Meeting on October 18, 2018; 

• You may send a written notice which is received before the start of the Special Meeting on October 18, 2018 that you are revoking your proxy to 3000 N.W.
107th Avenue Miami, Florida 33172, Attention: Tricia Thompkins, General Counsel and Secretary; or 

• You may attend the Special Meeting and notify the election officials that you wish to revoke your proxy and vote in person. Your attendance at the Special
Meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.

If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other agent as your nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other agent.

Q:    What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?

A: This means you own shares of Company Common Stock that are registered under different names or are in more than one account. For example, you may own some
shares directly as a shareholder of record and other shares through a broker or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive
multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy
cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by
mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.

Q:    If the merger is completed, how will I receive cash for my shares?

A: If the merger agreement is adopted and the merger is consummated, and if you are the record holder of your shares of Company Common Stock (i.e., you have a stock
certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or you hold shares in book-entry), as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within three business days, after the
effective time of the merger, you will be sent a letter of transmittal to complete and return to a paying agent to be designated by Parent, referred to herein as the "paying
agent." In order to receive the $27.50 per share merger consideration, you must send the paying agent, according to the instructions provided, your validly completed and
signed letter of transmittal together with your Company stock certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry shares, as applicable, and other required
documents as instructed in the separate mailing. Once you have properly submitted these materials, you will receive cash for your shares. If your shares of Company
Common Stock are held in "street name" by your broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive instructions after the effective time of the merger from your broker,
bank or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your "street name" shares and receive cash for those shares.

Q:    What happens if the merger is not completed?

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by the shareholders of the Company or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, the shareholders of the Company will
not receive any payment for their shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will remain a stand-alone company, Company
Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Market and registered under the Exchange Act, and the Company will continue to file periodic
reports with the SEC with respect to Company Common Stock. Under specified circumstances, the Company may be required to pay to Parent, or may be entitled to
receive from Parent, a fee with respect to the termination of the merger agreement, as described under "The Merger Agreement—Effect of Termination; Fees and
Expenses" beginning on page 139.

Q:    When should I send in my stock certificates?

A: If the merger agreement is adopted you will receive the letter of transmittal following the consummation of the merger. You should send your stock certificates (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) together with the letter of transmittal in accordance with the instructions provided after the merger is consummated and not now.

Q:    I do not know where my stock certificate is—how will I get my cash?

A: The materials you are sent after the completion of the merger will include the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate. This will
include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificate. The Company may also require that you provide a customary indemnity
agreement to the Company in order to cover any potential loss.

Q:    What happens if I sell my shares of Company Common Stock before the Special Meeting?

A: The record date for shareholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the consummation of the merger. If you transfer your shares of Company Common
Stock after the record date but before the Special Meeting you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the Special Meeting, but will
transfer the right to receive the merger consideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares.

Q:    What rights do I have to seek a valuation of my shares?

A: Shareholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement may exercise their right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of Company
Common Stock if the merger is completed in lieu of receiving the per share merger consideration, but only if they do not vote in

favor of adopting the merger agreement and otherwise comply with the procedures of Sections 607.1301 through 607.1333 of the FBCA, which is the appraisal rights
statute applicable to Florida corporations. A copy of Sections 607.1301 through 607.1333 of the FBCA is included as Appendix C to this Proxy Statement and the

Q:    What do I need to do now?

A: You should carefully read this Proxy Statement, including the appendices, in their entirety, and consider how the merger and the "golden parachute compensation" would
affect you. Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure the presence of a quorum and that your shares are represented at the
Special Meeting, please vote via the Internet or by telephone as instructed in the accompanying proxy materials or complete, date, sign and return a proxy card
as promptly as possible.

SPECIAL FACTORS 

        The following, together with the summary of the merger agreement set forth under "The Merger Agreement," is a description of the material aspects of the merger. While we
believe that the following description covers the material aspects of the merger, the description may not contain all of the information that is important to you. We encourage you
to read carefully this entire document, including the Agreement and Plan of Merger attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A, for a more complete understanding of the
merger. The following description is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the merger agreement. You may obtain additional information without charge by
following the instructions in "Where Shareholders Can Find More Information" beginning on page 160 of this Proxy Statement.

Background of the Merger 

        From time to time, the Board and the Company's senior management have evaluated potential strategic alternatives relating to the Company's businesses, including business
combinations, strategic partnerships, acquisitions and other potential strategic transactions, all with a view towards enhancing shareholder value. No firm offer to acquire the
Company has been made during the past two years, except as described below.

        In August, 2017, the independent directors of the Company, Joe Arriola, Jane DeFlorio, Bruce J. Klatsky, Michael W. Rayden and J. David Scheiner, began to evaluate the
role of Mr. George Feldenkreis as Executive Chairman of the Company. On September 20, 2017, the Board removed Mr. George Feldenkreis as Executive Chairman of the
Company, simultaneously terminating his operational role in the Company, and elected Mr. Scheiner as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board.

        On October 24, 2017, the Board formed the Special Committee to review certain matters, including the role of Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis as Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, his employment arrangement with the Company and strategic planning for the Company. Subsequently and throughout the process, the Special Committee continued
to evaluate the role of Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis. The Special Committee, as of the time it received the Feldenkreis Proposal (as defined below), had not yet reached a conclusion on
these matters and therefore deferred reaching a conclusion on these matters while the Feldenkreis Proposal remained a potential value maximizing strategy for shareholders.

        On February 6, 2018, the Company received an unsolicited letter from Mr. George Feldenkreis (the former Executive Chairman of the Company, and a member of the
Board) and Fortress Credit Advisors LLC ("Fortress"). Mr. George Feldenkreis proposed to acquire the Company in an all cash transaction for $27.50 per share (the "Feldenkreis
Proposal"). Therein, Mr. George Feldenkreis stated that he would anticipate discussing with Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis (the Company's Chief Executive Officer and a member of the
Board) whether Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis would contribute his existing equity ownership of the Company as part of a negotiated transaction. The Feldenkreis Proposal noted that
Mr. George Feldenkreis had engaged SCOPE Advisors, LLC ("Scope") as financial advisors, and Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP ("Olshan") and Stearns Weaver Miller Weissler
Alhadeff & Sitterson as legal counsel, and that Fortress had engaged Kirkland & Ellis LLP as legal counsel. Mr. George Feldenkreis noted that if he did not receive a favorable
response from the Board to the Feldenkreis Proposal by March 10, 2018, he intended to evaluate all of his options as a shareholder of the Company and take appropriate action
with respect to his investment.

        On February 7, 2018, Mr. George Feldenkreis filed a statement on Schedule 13D disclosing his interest in acquiring the Company at $27.50 per share and certain
understandings in place between Mr. George Feldenkreis and Fortress. Mr. George Feldenkreis explicitly reserved his right to propose a slate of directors for election to the Board
at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders (the "2018 Annual Meeting"). The Schedule 13D disclosure also noted that Mr. George Feldenkreis and Fortress

had entered into a non-binding letter of intent in which Fortress "confirmed it would consider committing $300 million of debt and/or equity financing toward the proposed
acquisition". Further, the Schedule 13D disclosed that Mr. George Feldenkreis had entered into a letter agreement with Fortress pursuant to which he agreed to pay Fortress a
profit sharing fee if Mr. George Feldenkreis sold his shares (or entered into an agreement to sell such shares) to a third party within six months of the date of such agreement, in
an amount equal to $1 million for each $1.00 of share price in excess of $23.50 per share, up to a maximum of $5 million.

        Also on February 7, 2018, the Special Committee delivered a letter to Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis, noting that the Feldenkreis Proposal explicitly anticipated discussions between
Mr. George Feldenkreis and Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis in respect of Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis contributing his existing equity, and directing Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis to refrain, absent
prior written consent of the Special Committee, from making any public or private statements or engaging in any public or private communications with any customers,
suppliers, employees, consultants, officers or other business relations of the Company, including George Feldenkreis, Fortress Credit Advisors LLC or any of their respective
affiliates, advisors or other representatives, in each case regarding the Feldenkreis Proposal or any alternative transaction that may be considered by the Board or its committees
in connection with the evaluation of such proposal.

        On February 9, 2018, the Special Committee sent a letter to Mr. George Feldenkreis reminding Mr. George Feldenkreis of his fiduciary duties to protect the confidentiality
of the Company's non-public or proprietary information and to refrain from using such information for any reason other than his service to the Company as a director. The letter
explicitly indicated that fiduciary duties under Florida law would prohibit Mr. George Feldenkreis from using any non-public, proprietary or confidential information concerning
the Company for the purpose of facilitating the transaction contemplated by the Feldenkreis Proposal.

        Also on February 9, 2018, Mr. George Feldenkreis responded to the Special Committee with a letter confirming his knowledge of his fiduciary duties and reminding the
Special Committee of its fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the Company's shareholders.

        On February 13, 2018, the Board held a meeting, at which all directors were present, during which it expanded the powers of the Special Committee, giving it exclusive
power to (i) evaluate the terms and conditions of the Feldenkreis Proposal or any alternative thereto, and determine whether the Feldenkreis Proposal or any alternative thereto is
advisable, fair, and in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders, (ii) negotiate with any party regarding the Feldenkreis Proposal or any alternative thereto, and if the
Special Committee deems appropriate and permissive under applicable law, approve the execution and delivery of documents in connection therewith on behalf of the Company,
(iii) determine whether the Feldenkreis Proposal or any alternative thereto is beneficial to the Company and its shareholders and (iv) recommend to the full Board what action, if
any, should be taken with respect to the Feldenkreis Proposal or any alternative thereto, including the rejection of the Feldenkreis Proposal or any alternative thereto. The
resolutions explicitly empowered the Special Committee to retain, at the Company's expense, independent legal counsel and financial advisors in connection with such duties,
and to act on behalf of the Company in connection with any matters ancillary or related to the Special Committee's purpose, including entering into contracts of any nature,
commencing litigation and authorizing defensive measures on behalf of the Company. The resolutions authorized and directed the Company to pay all fees, expenses and
disbursements, and to honor all other obligations of the Company under such contracts, in connection with such matters. The resolutions explicitly indicated the Special
Committee was not required to furnish to the Board any work product or communications between the members of the Special Committee and its counsel and advisors.

        Also on February 13, 2018, the Special Committee met and discussed with Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP ("Paul, Weiss") and Akerman LLP ("Akerman")
(each of whom had been retained by the independent directors in August 2017, in connection with the review of Mr. George Feldenkreis' role with the Company) the Special
Committee's fiduciary duties in connection with the Company's process for evaluating strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company. The Special Committee
discussed the role of Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis and his role in the process of the Feldenkreis Proposal. At this meeting, settlement negotiations between the Company and Ms. Fanny
Hanono, a former Company employee and Mr. George Feldenkreis' daughter, were also discussed.

        Between February 6 and February 17, 2018, members of the Special Committee met with several financial advisors about potentially representing the Special Committee in
connection with evaluating the Feldenkreis Proposal and any strategic alternatives thereto. On February 22, 2018, the Special Committee approved the Company's engagement of
PJ Solomon as the Special Committee's financial advisor, following discussion (including regarding the Special Committee's fiduciary duties), and in connection therewith, the
Company entered into an Engagement Letter with PJ Solomon, and a Non-Disclosure Agreement with PJ Solomon. The Special Committee selected PJ Solomon as its financial
advisor because PJ Solomon is a recognized financial advisory firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger and after taking into account the
conclusion of PJ Solomon, at the time of such selection (which was subsequently reconfirmed in connection with delivery of the fairness opinion on June 15, 2018), that there
were no relationships or interests in connection with the proposed merger that would limit the ability of PJ Solomon to perform its obligations as financial advisor to the Special
Committee. Also on February 22, 2018, representatives of PJ Solomon met with senior members of management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis,
Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jorge Narino, and General Counsel, Ms. Tricia Thompkins. At the meeting the parties discussed the Company's initial 2019 budget projections, a "3-
year plan" and the Company's non-core brand analysis. PJ Solomon would later report to the Special Committee that management of the Company had informed PJ Solomon that
(i) the Company had not yet completed the preparation of financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 as the closing was not yet complete following the fiscal
year end, (ii) the fiscal year 2019 budget would be reviewed to consider recent and potential bankruptcy filings by customers of the Company, and (iii) the "3-year plan" was
preliminary and not yet complete, consisting solely of 2019 projections with revenue "rollups" and no expense projections.

        On February 22, 2018, representatives of PJ Solomon spoke with Mr. George Feldenkreis' financial advisor, Scope, to discuss process and the proposed capital structure for
an acquisition of the Company by Mr. George Feldenkreis. During that conversation, Scope relayed that there would be sufficient capital between the rollover of shares held by
Mr. George Feldenkreis and his family, on the one hand, and Fortress' commitment to provide $300 million of debt and/or equity financing on the other hand, to finance the
Feldenkreis Proposal.

        On February 23, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors and discussed Mr. George Feldenkreis' ongoing interest in acquiring the Company, including whether the
Feldenkreis Proposal would materialize into an actionable opportunity for shareholders, the potential timing of the Feldenkreis Proposal or any alternative transaction, and the
desirability of bringing in an independent third-party management consultant to review the Company's projections.

        On February 26, 2018, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Board authorized the Special Committee to review the Feldenkreis Proposal and that the
Special Committee retained Paul, Weiss and Akerman as its legal counsel and PJ Solomon as its financial advisor to assist with its review.

        On February 27, 2018, Olshan sent a letter to Paul, Weiss requesting that the Company move quickly to engage with Mr. George Feldenkreis. Olshan also requested that the
Company send a draft

non-disclosure agreement in order to permit Fortress to conduct due diligence in connection with the Feldenkreis Proposal.

        On March 3, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. At this meeting, the Special Committee reviewed a presentation
prepared by PJ Solomon with its financial and legal advisors, which reviewed the terms of the Feldenkreis Proposal, trading multiples represented by the Feldenkreis Proposal,
publicly available historical trading market data about the Company, publicly available research analyst views on the Company, management's most recent stand-alone plan for
the Company going forward, growth rates reflected in this management plan, risks associated with this management plan, preliminary financial analyses of the Company using
data from this management plan (which preliminary analyses consisted of a preliminary selected companies analysis that used an illustrative range of price/earnings multiples of
11.0x to 17.0x and indicated an illustrative range of values per share of the Company of $22.00 to $34.00; a preliminary selected precedent transactions analysis that used an
illustrative range of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") multiples of 6.0x to 8.5x and indicated an illustrative range of values per Company
share of $18.84 to $28.24; a preliminary discounted cash flow analysis that used an illustrative range of exit EBITDA multiples of 7.6x to 9.6x and of discount rates of 10.0% to
14.0% and indicated an illustrative range of values per share of Company of $27.37 to $38.59; a preliminary LBO analysis that used an illustrative exit EBITDA multiple of 8.3x
and IRR range of 20.0% to 25.0% and indicated an illustrative range of values per share of the Company of $27.00 to $31.00, and a preliminary present value of future share
price analysis that used an illustrative range of one-year forward earnings per share ("EPS") multiples of 11.3x to 16.7x and discount rate of 12.6% and indicated an illustrative
range of values per share of the Company of $22.70 to $37.30), headwinds facing retailers in the Company's customer base, private equity market's views regarding the retail and
apparel sector, discussions with representatives of Mr. George Feldenkreis regarding financing plans, views on potential market checks, the Company's stock price before and
after the Feldenkreis Proposal, and potential strategic alternatives and next steps. A copy of the presentation is attached as exhibit (c)(7) to the Statement on Schedule 13E-3, filed
by the Company and the filing persons listed thereon with the SEC on August 3, 2018. Paul, Weiss and Akerman then provided the Special Committee with a review of the
Special Committee's fiduciary duties in the context of evaluating the Feldenkreis Proposal. After discussion, the Special Committee directed its advisors to propose that
Mr. George Feldenkreis and Fortress sign a confidentiality agreement, including a standstill, during which Mr. George Feldenkreis and Fortress would conduct their respective
diligence. The Special Committee also directed its advisors to raise the prospect of bringing in an independent third-party consultant to review the management projections
independently during negotiations of the confidentiality agreement and to advise Mr. George Feldenkreis that a market check would be conducted.

        On March 4, 2018, Paul, Weiss circulated an initial draft of a proposed form of confidentiality agreement to Olshan, and over the following ten days, Olshan and Paul, Weiss
negotiated the terms of the confidentiality agreement.

        On March 9, 2018, Mr. George Feldenkreis submitted a letter to the Board which reaffirmed the Feldenkreis Proposal in all respects. The letter stated that the Special
Committee had not responded to the Feldenkreis Proposal and instead the Special Committee sent a non-disclosure agreement with "unreasonable and onerous terms." In the
interest of moving forward, Mr. George Feldenkreis proposed that Fortress begin its due diligence review under its own non-disclosure agreement with the Company and that the
Board extend the director nomination window by 30 days to avoid an unnecessary contested election at the 2018 Annual Meeting. Mr. George Feldenkreis indicated that if the
Board would not extend the nomination deadline for the 2018 Annual Meeting, he would need to preserve his rights as a shareholder and nominate a slate of directors for election
to the Board at the 2018 Annual Meeting.

        On March 10, 2018, representatives from Paul, Weiss spoke with Olshan regarding the proposed confidentiality agreement between the Company and Mr. George
Feldenkreis and whether Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis would be permitted to speak with Mr. George Feldenkreis regarding the Feldenkreis Proposal or any alternative transaction.
Olshan advised that Mr. George Feldenkreis wanted to discuss Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis' potential involvement. Olshan suggested it would revert regarding this issue and also
suggested that Mr. George Feldenkreis would consider a limited standstill.

        On March 11, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. The Special Committee discussed Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis' potential
participation in the Feldenkreis Proposal and his potentially conflicting interest with his role as CEO of the Company. The Special Committee also discussed whether it would be
advisable for the Special Committee to hire an independent third-party management consultant.

        On March 12, 2018, Mr. George Feldenkreis filed a statement on Schedule 13D, publicly disclosing the letter he submitted to the Board on March 9, 2018, noting that he
reaffirmed his offer to acquire all of the shares of the Company for $27.50 per share and that he requested that the shareholder nomination deadline be extended for 30 days.
Mr. George Feldenkreis also noted his intention, if the nomination deadline was not extended, to nominate a slate of directors at the 2018 Annual Meeting.

        Also on March 12, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors and discussed Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis and his potential participation in the Feldenkreis Proposal.
Following this discussion, the Special Committee decided that it would direct its advisors to attempt to negotiate a process agreement with each of Mr. George Feldenkreis,
Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis, and Fortress regarding what information cannot be shared and, in the case of Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis, permitting the Company to bring in an independent
third-party consultant and setting cooperation efforts obligations for Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis in connection therewith.

        On March 13, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors and reviewed with Paul, Weiss the key terms of the confidentiality agreement negotiated with Mr. George
Feldenkreis. The Special Committee also discussed the treatment of Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis and his potential participation in the Feldenkreis Proposal. The Special Committee
noted that it would continue to explore strategic alternatives, including stand-alone strategies and proposals from other bidders, and that it would assess those alternatives based
in part on advice of PJ Solomon. The Special Committee then discussed the proposed process letter between the Company and Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis, which permitted the
Special Committee to engage an independent third-party consultant without triggering any rights of Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis under his employment agreement, and a list of
potential equity financing sources that Mr. George Feldenkreis requested to be pre-approved for permitted disclosure under the terms of his confidentiality agreement.

        On March 14, 2018, the Special Committee approved entry into confidentiality agreements with Mr. George Feldenkreis and Fortress, and a letter agreement with Mr. Oscar
Feldenkreis regarding the Special Committee engaging a consultant and Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis' potential participation in the Feldenkreis Proposal. The Special Committee also
decided to move forward with the process of engaging AlixPartners, LLP ("AlixPartners"), as the independent third-party consultant. AlixPartners was primarily engaged as a
management consultant to provide confirmatory due diligence and an independent review of the reasonableness of the March 2018 Management Projections (as defined in
"Special Factors—Projected Financial Information" beginning on page 74) so that the Special Committee could instruct PJ Solomon as to whether such projections could be
relied upon as part of the materials reviewed by PJ Solomon in conducting its financial analysis and delivering its fairness opinion. AlixPartners' engagement also provided that
AlixPartners would, if requested, assist the Special Committee to obtain and compile information needed to present the Company to prospective purchasers or investors and that
AlixPartners may be requested to provide other customary consulting services as may be requested by the Special Committee. The Special Committee did not issue any

instructions or limitations on the investigation to AlixPartners concerning its work. The Special Committee further authorized PJ Solomon to conduct a market check (consistent
with the market check process, including the identification of potential strategic and financial bidders to be contacted therein, as reviewed by PJ Solomon with the Special
Committee on March 3, 2018) using a form of confidentiality agreement substantially similar to the form used for Fortress.

        Later on March 14, 2018, at a Board meeting at which all members were present, the Board unanimously adopted resolutions that, upon execution of the confidentiality
agreements with Mr. George Feldenkreis and Fortress, and the letter agreement with Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis, the Company's Bylaws would be amended to extend the director
nomination deadline to April 12, 2018. Following the meeting the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Mr. George Feldenkreis, a confidentiality agreement
with Fortress, and a letter agreement with Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis, the effectiveness of which triggered the effectiveness of the Bylaw amendment extending the director
nomination deadline to April 12, 2018.

        On March 15, 2018, Mr. George Feldenkreis filed a statement on Schedule 13D, publicly disclosing his entry into a confidentiality agreement with the Company (the
"Feldenkreis Confidentiality Agreement"). Mr. George Feldenkreis stated that he agreed to customary standstill provisions through the later of (i) the conclusion of the
Company's annual meeting and (ii) the date that is six months following the date of the Feldenkreis Confidentiality Agreement, except that after April 10, 2018, Mr. George
Feldenkreis may nominate candidates for election to the Board.

        Also on March 15, 2018, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with AlixPartners to serve as an independent third-party consultant to the Special
Committee. On March 16, 2018, the Company entered into an engagement agreement with AlixPartners.

        On March 16, 2018, Mr. George Feldenkreis, Fortress, Scope, PJ Solomon and members of the Company's management had an initial in-person meeting to discuss Fortress'
plans for financing the Feldenkreis Proposal.

        Also on March 16, 2018, PJ Solomon contacted Randa Accessories Leather Goods, LLC ("Randa") in connection with PJ Solomon's market check. Randa then requested
that the Company enter into a confidentiality agreement with Randa, which confidentiality agreement was entered into the following day (the "Randa NDA").

        On March 19, 2018, the Company received a heavily marked confidentiality agreement from Party B (which included the rejection of the standstill). PJ Solomon informed
Party B that its markup was unacceptable, and Party B never responded.

        Also on March 19, 2018, PJ Solomon launched the online data room, which had been compiled by management of the Company, and Fortress received access to conduct
due diligence.

        On March 23, 2018, PJ Solomon provided Randa with a copy of the Company's confidential information memorandum.

        On March 26, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. PJ Solomon gave a summary of the strategic alternative review
process, noting that PJ Solomon had contacted 18 parties (9 private equity and 9 strategic), but aside from Mr. George Feldenkreis and Fortress, only Randa had executed a
confidentiality agreement. The Special Committee determined that it needed a bona fide proposal from Randa (a strategic competitor) before granting due diligence and that
further consideration would be required to ensure Randa was serious before sharing commercially sensitive information. Representatives of AlixPartners provided the Special
Committee with their initial impressions of the Company. At this same meeting, the Chairman of the Special Committee reported that Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis, in light of the
process being undertaken by the Special Committee, had requested that the Special Committee adopt a retention plan for certain key

employees in view of their knowledge and roles in the process. The Special Committee agreed to consider this matter.

        Also on March 26, 2018, Ms. Fanny Hanono entered into a severance agreement and general release with the Company, pursuant to which she would receive 18 months of
her base salary, her bonus, COBRA health benefits and long-term incentive performance-based compensation pursuant to the terms of such agreement.

        Between March 26, 2018 and June 15, 2018, four potential debt financing sources (in addition to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo") and Fortress)
executed joinder agreements with Mr. George Feldenkreis or non-disclosure agreements directly with the Company, in each case permitting such potential debt financing sources
to receive confidential information in connection with their respective evaluations of debt financing for the Feldenkreis Proposal.

        On March 28, 2018, PJ Solomon provided Randa with a process letter inviting Randa to submit an initial indication of interest by April 5, 2018.

        On March 30, 2018, Paul, Weiss circulated an initial draft of the agreement and plan of merger to Olshan. Also on March 30, 2018, Fortress had a diligence call with the
Company's management.

        On April 2, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. PJ Solomon advised that of the 18 parties it had reached out to in March,
only Mr. George Feldenkreis and Randa were conducting diligence. PJ Solomon noted Randa was expected to submit a non-binding indication of interest no later than April 5th.
PJ Solomon noted that Fortress had indicated it was nearing completion of its business due diligence, and that Fortress had the capacity to backstop the debt financing needed for
the Feldenkreis Proposal if an ABL financing could not be achieved. PJ Solomon also advised the Special Committee that Mr. George Feldenkreis' financial advisor believed the
director nomination window for the 2018 Annual Meeting, scheduled to expire on April 12th, would likely need to be extended to provide more time for Mr. George Feldenkreis'
financing sources to conduct their due diligence.

        On April 5, 2018, Randa submitted a non-binding indication of interest (the "Randa Proposal") indicating a potential purchase price of $27.75 per share in an all cash
transaction with no financing contingency and suggesting that it would take about two weeks to complete diligence and submit a letter of intent.

        On April 6, 2018, Mr. George Feldenkreis' financial advisor circulated a list of eight outstanding diligence requests from Fortress.

        Also on April 6, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. AlixPartners reviewed with the Special Committee its approach and
diligence with respect to its engagement, a summary of the Company's strategies and business plans, and benchmarking and bottom-up analyses of the Company's projections.
Specifically, in order to analyze the business plan of the Company, AlixPartners (i) attended a Company presentation to Fortress; (ii) reviewed documentation from the online
data room launched by PJ Solomon on March 19, 2018; (iii) held update calls with the Special Committee, PJ Solomon, and Paul, Weiss; (iv) benchmarked key operating and
financial metrics against AlixPartner's knowledge base and comparable firm public financials; and (v) conducted interviews with certain members of Company management.
AlixPartners reviewed with the Special Committee their observations of the risks and opportunities associated with the management's strategic plans, which weighed the
importance of maintaining and building the Company's existing brands against the cost and management effort required to enhance the Company's brands. In particular,
AlixPartners expressed its belief that the Company's strength is as a wholesale apparel operator and suggested consideration to strategies focused on brand equity building. In
evaluating management, AlixPartners noted its belief that there appeared to be no evidence of a strategic plan or strategic planning process. AlixPartners suggested an increased
focus on strategic

planning as well as consideration of shifting capital and resources to brand investment to avoid losing brand relevance, while noting that there were risks and uncertainties
involved in such a shift in focus. AlixPartners also discussed its view that, in order to make sufficient resources available to meet brand-building objectives, the Company should
consider changes to its management organization and cost structure. In particular, AlixPartners believed that operating expenses could be rebalanced and the Company's
organizational and operating complexities could be reduced. The Special Committee also asked AlixPartners to assess leadership and morale at the Company (a) in light of the
request by the Company's CEO that the Company implement a retention plan, and (b) with a view towards understanding (x) the possible strategic alternatives to the Feldenkreis
Proposal and (y) the potential to further develop and exploit the Company's assets. Based on the foregoing approach, AlixPartners believed that the March 2018 Management
Projections as presented for the fiscal years 2019 - 2021 were within a range that was reasonable and were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the then-best available
estimates and judgments of the Company's management of the future financial performance of the Company. The Special Committee did not base its determination concerning
the use of the projections on any external factors other than that the projections were prepared by the Company's management and the analysis performed by AlixPartners. The
Company's management did not review AlixPartners' written presentation, including AlixPartners' views regarding the Company's strategies and business plans, prior to
AlixPartners' delivery of its written presentation to the Special Committee. Following the execution of the merger agreement, AlixPartners' views and written presentation were
shared with Company management and George Feldenkreis, who agreed with AlixPartners' conclusions regarding management's projections, but not with AlixPartners' views
regarding management's strategic plans.

        Also on April 6, 2018, the Special Committee determined, after considering, among other things, the oral briefing and written presentation of AlixPartners, that the March
2018 Management Projections (which had been adjusted to reflect contraction in the Company's retail customer base, including the bankruptcy of Bon-Ton), based on the
interviews, documents and data analyzed by AlixPartners (the truth, accuracy, or completeness of which were not independently verified by AlixPartners) were reasonably
prepared and reflected the best estimates available at that time of the Company's management of the Company's future financial performance and that PJ Solomon should utilize
the March 2018 Management Projections for its financial analysis. The Special Committee then discussed a proposal from Mr. George Feldenkreis' counsel to extend the director
nomination window from April 12th to April 30th (with a standstill for Mr. George Feldenkreis to nominate director candidates to expire on April 26th) in exchange for a public
reaffirmation of the Feldenkreis Proposal, including the $27.50 price. The Special Committee unanimously approved moving forward with this extension, in part because it
would give Randa time to catch up to Mr. George Feldenkreis and submit a further progressed proposal. The Special Committee also reviewed the Randa Proposal with PJ
Solomon and concluded, based in part on advice from PJ Solomon, that it was in the best interest of the Company's shareholders to allow Randa to enter the strategic process and
conduct due diligence. PJ Solomon noted that Randa was a brand operator, and the Special Committee determined that due diligence would be provided taking into account
appropriate staging of competitively sensitive information. Representatives from PJ Solomon also noted that another strategic party had expressed interest in working with
Mr. George Feldenkreis and his proposal. Given that such other strategic party ("Party C") previously indicated it would not be adverse to Mr. George Feldenkreis, and given its
strategic objectives would not lend itself to bid for the whole Company in any event, the Special Committee concluded it was in the best interest of shareholders to allow Party C
to potentially work with Mr. George Feldenkreis. PJ Solomon noted that Party C was a licensor, but was not a competitive brand operator.

        Between April 6, 2018 and April 10, 2018, PJ Solomon worked with Company management and general counsel to classify data room files that contained competitively
sensitive information so that staged access could be given to those files when and if the Special Committee determined that

potential competitors of the Company, including Randa, were sufficiently progressed in bidding to justify providing access.

        On April 9, 2018, at a Board meeting at which all members were present, the Board unanimously adopted resolutions that, upon execution of an amendment to the
Feldenkreis Confidentiality Agreement and a letter reaffirming the Feldenkreis Proposal, amended the Company's Bylaws to extend the director nomination deadline for the 2018
Annual Meeting to April 30, 2018. Following the meeting, the Company and Mr. George Feldenkreis executed an amendment to the Feldenkreis Confidentiality Agreement
extending the director nomination standstill to April 26, 2018 and Fortress and Mr. George Feldenkreis executed a letter reaffirming the Feldenkreis Proposal.

        Also on April 9, 2018, Mr. George Feldenkreis filed a statement on Schedule 13D, publicly disclosing this letter and noting that he reaffirmed his offer to acquire all of the
shares of the Company for $27.50 per share and that Mr. George Feldenkreis and the Company amended the Feldenkreis Confidentiality Agreement to extend the director
nomination standstill to April 26, 2018.

        On April 10, 2018, Randa received access to the data room. On April 11, 2018, representatives from Randa met with representatives of PJ Solomon, Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis
and certain other members of senior management of the Company at the Company's headquarters in Miami, Florida.

        On April 12, 2018, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party C in connection with the Feldenkreis Proposal.

        Also on April 12, 2018, after discussions involving the Special Committee and members of senior management, representatives from Paul, Weiss spoke with FWCook
("Cook"), the Company's regular compensation consultant, and outlined a potential change in control severance plan ("CIC Severance Plan"), so that Cook could begin to
benchmark such a plan for the Company's compensation committee (the "Compensation Committee"). Cook prepared a report which was provided to the Special Committee (the
"Cook Report"), a copy of which is attached as exhibit (c)(9) to the Statement on Schedule 13E-3, filed by the Company and the filing persons listed thereon with the SEC on
August 3, 2018. The Special Committee engaged Cook to review the Company's proposed CIC Severance Plan for reasonableness in light of a potential change-in-control
transaction. The proposed CIC Severance Plan provides benefits in the event of an involuntary termination without "cause" or voluntary termination with "good reason" within
12 months following a change in control. The analysis provided by Cook in the Cook Report indicated that the Company's proposed program is reasonable and falls within the
range of market practice. Cook indicated that the cash severance benefits provided in the CIC Severance Plan are at the lower end of market practice, while the number of
covered employees is somewhat high in relation to market practice.

        On April 13, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Party C received data room access to conduct due diligence.

        On April 16, 2018, the Company's general counsel presented the Special Committee with the initial list of Company employees proposed to be included in a retention plan,
which identified approximately 76 potential employees.

        Also on April 16, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. The Special Committee reviewed the list of proposed participants
in the CIC Severance Plan with its financial and legal advisors. Representatives from Paul, Weiss outlined the proposed CIC Severance Plan and reported Cook's views and
benchmarking of the proposed CIC Severance Plan. The proposed CIC Severance Plan contemplated three tiers, the top-tier consisting of approximately 8-12 persons at the
senior level, the middle-tier consisting of approximately 8-12 persons, and the third-tier consisting of the remainder of participants. The Special Committee instructed
representatives from PJ Solomon to approach Randa regarding the potential implementation of the CIC Severance Plan and get an understanding of how Randa would perceive
such a plan. At this meeting, the Special

Committee reviewed a presentation prepared by PJ Solomon with its financial and legal advisors, which reviewed the terms of the Feldenkreis Proposal and the Randa Proposal,
trading multiples represented by the Feldenkreis Proposal and the Randa Proposal, publicly available historical trading market data about the Company, publicly available
research analyst views on the Company, management's most recent stand-alone plan for the Company going forward, growth rates reflected in this management plan, and
preliminary financial analyses of the Company using data from this management plan (which preliminary analyses consisted of a preliminary selected companies analysis that
used an illustrative range of price/earnings multiples of 11.0x to 18.0x and indicated an illustrative range of values per share of the Company of $22.00 to $36.00; a preliminary
selected precedent transactions analysis that used an illustrative range of EBITDA multiples of 6.0x to 8.5x and indicated an illustrative range of values per Company share of
$18.84 to $28.24; a preliminary discounted cash flow analysis that used an illustrative range of exit EBITDA multiples of 8.2x to 9.6x and of discount rates of 10.0% to 14.0%
and indicated an illustrative range of values per share of the Company of $22.42 to $30.34; a preliminary LBO analysis that used an illustrative exit EBITDA multiple of 8.3x
and IRR range of 20.0% to 25.0% and indicated an illustrative range of values per share of the Company of $26.00 to $27.50, and a preliminary present value of future share
price analysis that used an illustrative range of one-year forward EPS multiples of 13.5x to 16.9x and discount rate of 12.6% and indicated an illustrative range of values per
share of the Company of $27.09 to $32.09). A copy of the presentation is attached as exhibit (c)(6) to the Statement on Schedule 13E-3, filed by the Company and the filing
persons listed thereon with the SEC on August 3, 2018.

        Also on April 16, 2018, PJ Solomon, at the instruction of the Special Committee, approached representatives of Randa to discuss the retention of Company employees,
including the likelihood that the proposed CIC Severance Plan would be implemented in the near future. Randa indicated that it understood it was customary to have such a plan
in the context of a public strategic review process where risk of a change in control transaction becomes known to employees and indicated its interest in minimizing employee
disruption during the process. Additionally, PJ Solomon and Randa discussed (i) Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis' employment arrangements, including his rights upon a change in control
of the Company, (ii) the need for Randa's legal counsel to speak with Paul, Weiss regarding specific questions surrounding the Feldenkreis Proposal, (iii) the possibility of
receiving expense reimbursement in connection with the Randa Proposal, (iv) access to the Company's senior management to hold meetings and (v) potential third-party
financing sources with whom Randa would seek to sign joinder agreements.

        On April 17, 2018, Randa requested meetings with seven of the Company's senior managers. Also on April 17, 2018, Paul, Weiss circulated an initial draft of the agreement
and plan of merger to legal counsel for Randa.

        On April 19, 2018, Wells Fargo and Mr. George Feldenkreis executed a joinder agreement, permitting Wells Fargo to receive confidential information in connection with its
evaluation of debt financing for the Feldenkreis Proposal.

        On April 20, 2018, Cook delivered a draft of the Cook Report to the Special Committee regarding its review of the proposed CIC Severance Plan. In this draft Cook
concluded that the proposed CIC Severance Plan was reasonable and fell within the range of market practice. Specifically, the cash severance benefits were at the lower end of
market practice while the number of covered employees was at the higher end of market practice. A copy of the Cook Report is attached as exhibit (c)(9) to the Statement on
Schedule 13E-3, filed by the Company and the filing persons listed thereon with the SEC on August 3, 2018.

        Also on April 20, 2018, Paul, Weiss circulated draft disclosure schedules to Randa's legal counsel and Mr. George Feldenkreis' counsel.

        On April 22, 2018, at a Compensation Committee meeting at which all members were present, the Compensation Committee of the Board reviewed the proposed CIC
Severance Plan with representatives of Paul, Weiss. After deliberation, the Compensation Committee unanimously voted to approve the CIC Severance Plan. The participants in
the CIC Severance Plan included those persons listed in the proposal delivered by the Company's general counsel to the Special Committee on April 16, 2018, as well as three
additional participants requested to be included by Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis thereafter. None of the beneficiaries of the CIC Severance Plan are GF Group Filing Persons. The terms
of the CIC Severance Plan were not negotiated by Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis (apart from his participation in the creation of the list of proposed beneficiaries) or any other executive
officer of the Company.

        Between April 22, 2018 and June 15, 2018, 15 potential debt financing sources executed joinder agreements with Randa, permitting such potential debt financing sources to
receive confidential information in connection with their respective evaluations of debt financing for the Randa Proposal.

        On April 25, 2018, PJ Solomon spoke with Scope, who advised that Mr. George Feldenkreis would not increase the price of his offer of $27.50 per share to acquire all of the
shares of the Company.

        On April 26, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. The Special Committee discussed with its financial and legal advisors a
proposal from Mr. George Feldenkreis' counsel to extend the director nomination window from April 30th to May 18th in exchange for (i) an amendment to the Feldenkreis
Confidentiality Agreement extending Mr. George Feldenkreis' standstill period to May 16th and (ii) a public reaffirmation of the $27.50 price from Mr. George Feldenkreis. The
Special Committee unanimously approved moving forward with this extension. Representatives from PJ Solomon reported that Party C was still interested, but added that Party
C's proposed acquisition structure remained unclear. The Special Committee then discussed Randa's progress, and PJ Solomon noted that Randa's senior executives spent
16 hours over the prior three days in meetings with Company management (including 10 senior executives) and consultants from AlixPartners. Following this discussion, the
Special Committee also unanimously approved providing Randa with un-redacted versions of all licensing agreements in business lines where Randa was not considered a direct
competitor of the Company. During this meeting, the Special Committee also discussed Randa's request for expense reimbursement but declined to make a decision regarding the
request at that time.

        Also on April 26, 2018, the Board adopted resolutions by unanimous written consent that, upon execution of an amendment to the Feldenkreis Confidentiality Agreement
and a letter reaffirming the Feldenkreis Proposal, amended the Company's Bylaws to extend the director nomination deadline to May 18, 2018. Following adoption of the
resolutions, the Company and Mr. George Feldenkreis executed an amendment to the Feldenkreis Confidentiality Agreement extending the director nomination standstill to
May 16, 2018 and Fortress and Mr. George Feldenkreis executed a letter reaffirming the Feldenkreis Proposal.

        Also on April 26, 2018, the Company filed a Form 8-K, publicly disclosing adoption of the CIC Severance Plan.

        On April 27, 2018 Mr. George Feldenkreis filed a statement on Schedule 13D, publicly disclosing the letter executed by Mr. George Feldenkreis and Fortress, and noting
that Mr. George Feldenkreis reaffirmed his offer to acquire all of the shares of the Company for $27.50 per share and that Mr. George Feldenkreis and the Company amended the
Feldenkreis Confidentiality Agreement to extend the director nomination standstill to May 16, 2018.

        Also on April 27, 2018, PJ Solomon received an extensive supplemental diligence request list from Randa. Additionally, representatives from PJ Solomon and Randa
corresponded, and Randa identified two key items of outstanding diligence: (i) the competitive licenses, and (ii) discussions with the four

inbound licensees and 10 outbound licensees who accounted for a majority of the Company's cash flow. Randa also delivered a draft Expense Reimbursement Agreement.

        Also on April 27, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Scope informed PJ Solomon that another potential strategic partner ("Party D"), a brand licensor (though not
an operating competitor), was interested in partnering with Mr. George Feldenkreis in his bid to acquire the Company. Accordingly, PJ Solomon provided a draft of the non-
disclosure agreement to Party D. Party D confirmed receipt of the non-disclosure agreement, but never commented on, or executed, a non-disclosure agreement in respect of the
Feldenkreis Proposal. Accordingly, Party D was not provided access to the data room at that time.

        On April 28, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Scope informed PJ Solomon that Mr. George Feldenkreis had retained a team from Proskauer Rose LLP
("Proskauer") to serve as additional legal counsel, along with Olshan, for Mr. George Feldenkreis.

        On May 2, 2018, Randa called PJ Solomon and stated that Randa would go "pencils down" if the Special Committee refused to grant expense reimbursement. Later that day,
Paul, Weiss sent the Special Committee members a revised draft of Randa's proposed Expense Reimbursement Agreement.

        Also on May 2, 2018, Mr. George Feldenkreis sent a letter to the Special Committee expressing concerns he had regarding the CIC Severance Plan, including that
prospective buyers would not want to "fully absorb the potential liability under the CIC Severance Plan" and that "given the material impact that the CIC Severance Plan may
have on the Company's sales process and the value that shareholders will receive in any strategic transaction" it was Mr. George Feldenkreis' belief that the full Board should
have discussed the CIC Severance Plan (rather than just the Compensation Committee).

        Also on May 2, 2018, PJ Solomon spoke with Scope and requested an increase in per share merger consideration, Scope reiterated that Mr. George Feldenkreis would not
increase the price of his offer of $27.50 per share to acquire all of the shares of the Company.

        On May 3, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. The Special Committee discussed Randa's position and the importance of
keeping Randa in the process and commencing good faith negotiations of definitive terms as quickly as possible. Following this discussion, the Special Committee voted
unanimously to approve entry into the Expense Reimbursement Agreement subject to a cap. The Special Committee then discussed whether to share the remaining license
agreements with Randa, and after deliberation, the Special Committee approved providing unredacted versions of the remaining license agreements to Randa.

        Also on May 3, 2018, the Special Committee sent a response letter to Mr. George Feldenkreis disagreeing with Mr. George Feldenkreis' assertions in his May 2, 2018 letter
regarding the CIC Severance Plan, noting that the Company's CEO had requested that a program be implemented (and that the participants and tiers were as recommended by the
Company's CEO), and noting that the decision was properly before the Company's Compensation Committee.

        Also on May 3, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Olshan sent Paul, Weiss a revised draft of the merger agreement. From May 3, 2018 to June 15, 2018, Olshan
and Paul, Weiss engaged in negotiations of the merger agreement and ancillary documents related thereto.

        On May 4, 2018, the Special Committee unanimously approved revisions to, and the Company entered into, the Expense Reimbursement Agreement with Randa pursuant to
which the Company would reimburse Randa, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses up to a cap if the Company
enters into a definitive acquisition agreement with someone other than Randa, on or before July 31, 2018. Following execution of the Expense Reimbursement Agreement, legal
counsel for Randa circulated a revised draft of the merger agreement to Paul, Weiss. Randa also circulated a list of its highest priority diligence requests, which included direct
contact with the Company's four most material inbound licensors.

        On May 9, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Olshan sent Paul, Weiss a further revised draft of the merger agreement. The draft proposed that (i) the reverse
termination fee be increased from 1% (proposed by Olshan's first revised draft of the merger agreement) to 2% of the equity transaction value and that the Company's recourse
for any breach under the merger agreement would be limited to this 2% amount, (ii) the Company undergo a pre-closing restructuring (the specific steps of which were not
provided) to facilitate Mr. George Feldenkreis' IPCo/OPCo financing structure, (iii) no limited guarantee would be provided, and in lieu thereof, Mr. George Feldenkreis would
pledge certain of the shares of the Company owned directly by him to pay the reverse termination fee and other obligations of Parent under the merger agreement, (iv) obtaining
the consent of two licensors would be required as a condition to closing, and (v) a closing condition would be included that not more than 5% of shares have exercised appraisal
rights. Olshan also provided an overview of the proposed debt and equity financing structure and noted that significant progress had been made in the negotiation of the debt
commitment letter with Fortress.

        On May 10, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. PJ Solomon advised that with respect to the Feldenkreis Proposal, the
financing package proposed would have a leverage ratio higher than in any recent apparel deals, and would use an IPCo/OPCo structure. PJ Solomon advised the Special
Committee that it did not expect there would be any excess availability to increase the proposed offer of $27.50 per share in light of the financing structure. Paul, Weiss also gave
a detailed presentation on the terms of the merger agreement it had proposed for both bidders, and an overview of the open issues presented by each bidder. Of note, both bidders
had deleted the "go-shop" provisions in their respective bids and the Feldenkreis Proposal had a 2% termination fee and reverse termination fee, while the Randa Proposal had a
3.75% termination fee and reverse termination fee, in each case of equity transaction value.

        Also on May 10, 2018, PJ Solomon spoke with Scope and requested an increase in per share merger consideration, Scope again noted that Mr. George Feldenkreis would not
increase the price of his offer of $27.50 per share to acquire all of the shares of the Company.

        On May 11, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, representatives of Scope informed PJ Solomon that Mr. George Feldenkreis was hoping to sign in advance of the
May 18th nomination deadline for the 2018 Annual Meeting, and requested that Paul, Weiss deliver a revised version of the merger agreement. Scope advised that Mr. George
Feldenkreis expected to firm up his financing commitments shortly. Later that day, Paul, Weiss circulated a revised draft of the merger agreement to Olshan in respect of the
Feldenkreis Proposal. This draft removed conditions to closing related to dissenting shares and consent of third parties and reinstated a 7% reverse termination fee and recourse
above this amount for willful and material breaches.

        On May 12, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, representatives of Scope updated PJ Solomon on the status of the merger agreement review and delivery of the
financing commitments. Representatives of Scope also suggested that the director nomination deadline be extended to May 28, 2018 as Mr. George Feldenkreis was otherwise
going to nominate a slate of directors.

        On May 13, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Olshan sent Paul, Weiss a revised draft of the merger agreement, which proposed a reverse termination fee of 2.5%
of equity transaction value, and limited the Company's recourse for any breach under the merger agreement to a pledge of shares of Company Common Stock having a value at
the time of signing (based on $27.50 per share) of such fee amount. The revised draft also accepted the removal of the conditions to closing related to dissenting shares and
consent of third parties.

        On May 14, 2018, in respect of the Randa Proposal, Paul, Weiss sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to legal counsel for Randa including a proposed 2%
termination fee and 7% reverse termination fee, in each case of equity transaction value.

        On May 16, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Olshan delivered debt commitment letters from each of Fortress and Wells Fargo to Paul, Weiss, which Olshan
indicated were expected to be finalized shortly. These debt commitment papers (i) required the lenders' satisfaction with the pre-closing restructuring, the specific steps of which
were to be provided, (ii) did not contain a guarantee on the minimum borrowing base or availability under the asset based loan ("ABL"), and (iii) did not include a detailed
sources and uses.

        Also on May 16, 2018, Mr. George Feldenkreis sent a letter to the Special Committee reporting that his counsel delivered substantially complete drafts of debt financing
commitments, stating these provided "firm financing," and noting that his counsel had submitted a merger agreement and requesting a response. Mr. George Feldenkreis proposed
that, if the merger agreement could not be negotiated in full before Friday, May 18, 2018 when the window for submission of shareholder nominees to the Board would end, he
be granted exclusivity through May 25, 2018.

        Also on May 16, 2018 the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. Paul, Weiss and PJ Solomon provided a process update. Following
discussion, the Special Committee unanimously authorized PJ Solomon to begin coordinating Randa's conversations with the Company's top-three inbound licensors once the
expected debt financing commitment papers from Randa had been received. The Special Committee then discussed Mr. George Feldenkreis' proposal for exclusivity, and
determined that it needed to provide Randa an opportunity to complete its diligence before any exclusivity requests would be considered.

        Following the Special Committee call, also on May 16, 2018, Paul, Weiss responded to Olshan and Proskauer with a list of follow up questions on Mr. George Feldenkreis'
debt commitment letters, as well as delivering a revised version of the merger agreement. The Special Committee also delivered (i) a letter responding to Mr. George Feldenkreis'
request for exclusivity, denying the same and noting it was not believed to be in the best interest of shareholders, but noting its willingness to grant an extension of the
nomination window, and (ii) draft materials to extend the nomination window to Mr. George Feldenkreis' counsel.

        On May 17, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Proskauer delivered to Paul, Weiss a sources and uses table, a description of the pre-closing restructuring and
related structure chart. Thereafter, Paul, Weiss and Proskauer had a call regarding the financing of the Feldenkreis Proposal. Paul, Weiss noted its concerns including (i) the pre-
closing restructuring being required of the Company, (ii) the liquidity requirements and the concern that there would not be a guaranteed sufficient borrowing base at closing to
fund the transactions—noting that Paul, Weiss would expect minimum guaranteed availability at closing, (iii) the intercompany license arrangements that would be required in an
IPCo/OPCo financing, and (iv) the current status of the coordination of the credit silos and synchronization of the different commitments. Proskauer informed Paul, Weiss that
revised papers were in process and would be available shortly.

        Also on May 17, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, following the call between Paul, Weiss and Proskauer, Scope emailed PJ Solomon and noted that the concerns
expressed on the financing package would be addressed the following day. In connection therewith, Scope offered to consider a limited "go-shop" for any competing bidder, and
noted the desire of its client to sign over the weekend. PJ Solomon informed Scope that it did not believe a signing over the weekend was possible and the Special Committee
would need at least two more weeks to complete its process.

        On May 18, 2018, Mr. George Feldenkreis notified the Company of his intent to nominate individuals for election as directors at the 2018 Annual Meeting including
Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis, Mary Ellen Kanoff, Scott A. LaPorta and Matthew McEvoy. In addition, Mr. George Feldenkreis filed an amended Schedule 13D, disclosing his
nomination of Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis, Mary Ellen Kanoff, Scott A. LaPorta and Matthew McEvoy for election to the Board at the 2018 Annual Meeting. In the amended
Schedule 13D, Mr. George Feldenkreis expressed his desire to have signed a definitive

merger agreement prior to the May 18th deadline for shareholder nominations. Mr. George Feldenkreis also expressed his belief that any remaining issues could be resolved in a
limited amount of time. Mr. George Feldenkreis noted that given the amount of time that had passed since submitting his original bid to acquire the Company in February, he had
determined to nominate directors for election at the 2018 Annual Meeting in order to preserve his rights as a shareholder. Mr. George Feldenkreis acknowledged that Mr. Oscar
Feldenkreis was likely to be nominated by the Company for election to the Board at the 2018 Annual Meeting under his employment agreement. However, Mr. George
Feldenkreis determined to also nominate Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis for election to the Board to ensure his re-election because of Mr. George Feldenkreis' belief that Mr. Oscar
Feldenkreis' continued role as an executive and presence on the Board was essential and in the best interest of all shareholders. Mr. George Feldenkreis noted that Oscar
Feldenkreis' participation in Mr. George Feldenkreis' proxy solicitation would be limited to being named as a person nominated by Mr. George Feldenkreis and as a result,
Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis would be filing a Schedule 13D separately.

        Later on May 18, 2018, the Special Committee responded to Mr. George Feldenkreis' May 18, 2018 letter and Schedule 13D filing with a press release that it was continuing
its strategic review process to maximize shareholder value rather than contesting mischaracterizations of negotiations in the press by Mr. George Feldenkreis.

        On May 20, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Olshan delivered a revised merger agreement to Paul, Weiss. As had been noted on the May 17, 2018 call between
Proskauer and Paul, Weiss, the Company's obligation to consummate a pre-closing restructuring had been removed. Olshan proposed that any recourse under the agreement be
limited to 400,000 shares to be pledged by Mr. George Feldenkreis, which amounted to, approximately, a 2.5% reverse termination fee that had been previously proposed. The
draft also contained a footnote indicating that Olshan did not believe there was a need for a go shop, but that a limited go shop for a single bidder would be considered.

        On May 21, 2018, Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis filed a Schedule 13D stating while that he was not affirming his membership in a group, that he may be deemed a "group" within
the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act due to his consent to serve as a nominee of Mr. George Feldenkreis for election at the 2018 Annual Meeting. He stated that
apart from such disclosure, he had no plans or proposals that would result in any of the occurrences enumerated in (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

        Also on May 21, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. Paul, Weiss and PJ Solomon provided process updates. Following
discussion, the Special Committee unanimously approved the delivery of a letter to Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis which was sent shortly after the meeting. The letter, sent in light of
Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis' Schedule 13D disclosures, reminded him of his March 14, 2018 agreement not to share with Mr. George Feldenkreis or Fortress any confidential
information, material non-public information, information provided by the Company to the Special Committee or information about the process and other strategic alternatives.
The Special Committee instructed Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis to not communicate with Mr. George Feldenkreis or Fortress regarding the Company or its subsidiaries in the absence of
the presence and participation of a member of the Special Committee or its legal or financial advisors.

        Also on May 21, 2018, in respect of the Randa Proposal, legal counsel for Randa delivered to Paul, Weiss a bid package including a draft debt commitment letter from an
ABL lender financing source, a debt long form term sheet from an alternative debt financing source, and a revised merger agreement. The debt papers were materially insufficient
in both amount and certainty. PJ Solomon advised Randa's financial advisor of the same promptly and was advised that Randa was aware of the issues and had been frustrated
with one of its financing sources but assured PJ Solomon that Randa was working to fill the gaps expeditiously.

        On May 22, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, the advisors for the Special Committee and Mr. George Feldenkreis discussed open issues and the status of various
transaction documents and the debt commitment letters. Paul, Weiss and PJ Solomon communicated the view that the Special Committee process was making good progress but
that there were still items to be negotiated, especially with respect to financing terms and risks, before an actionable offer with definitive documents was ready to be put before
the Special Committee, and communicated their sense that it was unlikely to happen in the next few days with respect to any offer and that Mr. George Feldenkreis' advisory
team had been pressing for same.

        On May 23, 2018, Mr. George Feldenkreis sent a letter to the Special Committee, which was made public by press release, urging the Special Committee to immediately
commit to an expedited timeline to conclude negotiations and enter into a definitive agreement to acquire the Company. Therein, Mr. George Feldenkreis stated he was backed by
full financing, and was prepared to finalize and execute documents immediately. He stated that if the Company would not enter into a definitive acquisition agreement by
May 29, 2018, he would withdraw his proposal and pursue all other rights as a shareholder.

        Also on May 23, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Olshan circulated the first versions of the pledge agreement, limited guarantee, and rollover letter to Paul,
Weiss. As the last version of the merger agreement from Olshan had indicated, the limited guarantee and pledge agreement collectively provided the Company limited recourse to
400,000 of Mr. George Feldenkreis' shares. Proskauer also delivered to Paul, Weiss a revised term sheet and fee letter in respect of the Wells Fargo facility.

        Also on May 23, 2018, in respect of the Randa Proposal, Paul, Weiss and legal counsel for Randa had a call regarding open issues. Legal counsel for Randa acknowledged
the insufficiencies in the draft debt commitments and noted their understanding that Randa would not be permitted to contact the major inbound licensors of the business until it
proved to the Special Committee that it had the requisite financing.

        Also on May 23, 2018, the Special Committee met twice with its advisors and received updates regarding the process, documents and the open issues. Following discussion,
the Special Committee authorized its advisors to issue a press release in response to the public statement by Mr. George Feldenkreis and to continue to negotiate and try to
progress the process.

        On May 24, 2018, the Special Committee issued a press release responding to Mr. George Feldenkreis' statement that he would withdraw the Feldenkreis Proposal if the
Special Committee would not commit to an expedited timeline to conclude negotiations, noting that it was committed to conducting a bona fide process that would maximize
shareholder value and its willingness to negotiate towards a definitive agreement on customary and appropriate terms, although no decision had been made with respect to the
Company's response to the latest proposal from Mr. George Feldenkreis.

        Also on May 24, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Paul, Weiss delivered revised versions of the merger agreement and ancillary documents, as well as comments
to the debt commitments, to Olshan and Proskauer. The revised drafts maintained the Special Committee's position on the 7% reverse termination fee and the circumstances in
which it would become payable and removed certain proposed limitations on damages for a breach under the merger agreement. The revised drafts also contemplated that
Mr. George Feldenkreis would withdraw his nomination of directors effective as of the signing of the definitive agreements.

        On May 25, 2018, in respect of the Randa Proposal, Paul, Weiss delivered a revised merger agreement and Company disclosure letter to legal counsel for Randa.
Additionally, Party D, in connection with the Randa Proposal, executed a non-disclosure agreement, permitting it to receive confidential information in connection with its
evaluation of equity financing for the Randa Proposal. Paul, Weiss had conversations with legal counsel for Randa regarding the merger agreement draft and Randa's counsel
acknowledged that Randa was unlikely to have fully committed financing by the

May 29th deadline announced by Mr. George Feldenkreis and indicated that Randa's interest remained strong.

        Later on May 25, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Olshan delivered a revised merger agreement and certain ancillary agreements, which it indicated was
Mr. George Feldenkreis' best and final offer. The merger agreement proposed did not include a limited go-shop, which Olshan had previously indicated was under consideration,
due to the Special Committee's stance on the reverse termination fee. The merger agreement included a reverse termination fee equal to 3% of the equity transaction value (and
modified the situations under which it would be payable to circumstances resulting in the failure to obtain financing to fund the transaction), which 3% would be the maximum
recourse, including in the event of willful breach, secured by a pledge of a portion of Mr. George Feldenkreis' shares. The merger agreement also proposed a reduced Company
termination fee of 1.5% of the equity transaction value. In addition, the merger agreement provided for the cancellation of unvested employee performance-based equity awards
as to which the performance targets had not been achieved. The extent of the proposed cancellation was subsequently quantified by Scope on June 1, 2018. Olshan further
proposed that Mr. George Feldenkreis would not withdraw his nomination letter but would agree to not seek to compel the 2018 Annual Meeting if the Company would agree to
delay the 2018 Annual Meeting during the pendency of the merger agreement.

        On May 26, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. The Special Committee discussed the main open issues in respect of the
Feldenkreis Proposal. PJ Solomon also updated the Special Committee on Randa's progress, which included the addition of Party D who was being considered as a source of
considerable equity to help the Randa owner minimize risk. PJ Solomon advised the Special Committee that it had become clearer that Randa was not willing to match the equity
risk being taken by Mr. George Feldenkreis and Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis, who seemed to be uniquely willing and able to do so. The Special Committee, in respect of the
Feldenkreis Proposal, discussed the debt financing commitments and the execution risks and limited recourse for the failure of financing. Following discussion, the Special
Committee authorized its advisors to reject the best and final offer submitted by Mr. George Feldenkreis and to counter with an offer to continue to negotiate the other open
issues if a 5% reverse termination fee were acceptable.

        Also on May 26, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Paul, Weiss responded to Olshan regarding the various open issues and expressed a willingness to work
toward the deadline imposed by Mr. George Feldenkreis of May 29th, if a reverse termination fee of 5% was accepted by Mr. George Feldenkreis.

        Also on May 26, 2018, in respect of the Randa Proposal, legal counsel for Randa delivered revised versions of certain ancillary documents to Paul, Weiss.

        On May 27, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. The Special Committee discussed the primary open issues on the
Feldenkreis Proposal, and provided guidance to the advisors on the various draft documents.

        Also on May 27, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Paul, Weiss delivered the revised merger agreement and ancillary documents to Olshan and inquired about the
timing of revised drafts of the debt commitments. The revised merger agreement reflected the proposed 5% reverse termination fee (with a corresponding pledge of shares by
Mr. George Feldenkreis) and held firm on the Special Committee's position on when that would become payable. Paul, Weiss' revised drafts also permitted the Company to solicit
for the election of its incumbent directors if a shareholder sought to compel the 2018 Annual Meeting prior to the special meeting called to adopt the merger agreement with
Mr. George Feldenkreis, while Mr. George Feldenkreis would be restricted from soliciting for the election of his nominees.

        On May 29, 2018, in respect of the Randa Proposal, legal counsel for Randa delivered a revised merger agreement.

        Also on May 29, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive updates on the process. The Special Committee discussed the contingencies and risks in the
financing package being arranged for the Feldenkreis Proposal and encouraged its advisors to continue to work to try to ensure that the financing was sufficient in terms of both
amount and certainty in the interests of shareholders.

        From May 29, 2018 through June 15, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Proskauer and Paul, Weiss negotiated the terms of the Fortress and Wells Fargo debt
commitments.

        On May 31, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Scope advised PJ Solomon that Mr. George Feldenkreis would withdraw the Feldenkreis Proposal if he could not
enter into a definitive agreement with the Company by the end of the day due to the passage of almost four months since the submission of his original proposal to acquire the
Company and the substantial costs and expenses incurred by the Company or otherwise related to the proposed transaction. PJ Solomon then advised Scope that the Special
Committee believed the Feldenkreis Proposal lacked sufficient funds and executable financing commitments from the lenders.

        On June 1, 2018, PJ Solomon hosted representatives of Randa for a meeting. During the meeting, Randa's CEO said that he was still interested in owning the Company, but
did not want to bet the Randa business to accomplish this without an equity partner. Randa believed it could work with Party C or Party D to achieve a deal, but acknowledged
that it (i) had not found a workable structure due to anticipated tax consequences, (ii) did not have any financing and attributed such failure to be the result of no quality of
earnings having been timely commissioned on Randa's business, (iii) had not made significant progress toward items (i) or (ii) in the last two months and (iv) still required
conversations with the Company's key inbound licensors and wholesale customers.

        Also on June 1, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Olshan delivered a revised merger agreement and revised financing commitments. Olshan also stated that the
documents circulated were a final and best offer, and that its client looked to sign a deal over that weekend, with an announcement on the morning of June 4, 2018. Olshan noted
further that Mr. George Feldenkreis would withdraw his offer on the morning of June 4, 2018 to the extent that Paul, Weiss was unwilling to have an in-person discussion to
achieve a signing over the weekend. The revised Feldenkreis Proposal included a 4% reverse termination fee (with a corresponding pledge of shares by Mr. George Feldenkreis)
and a 2% Company termination fee, and the debt commitments continued to have no guaranteed minimum borrowing base to assure the Company of sufficient availability under
the debt commitments. Separately, Scope sent PJ Solomon a sources and uses table showing that the proposed cancellation of unvested performance-based equity awards
amounted to approximately $7.4 million.

        On June 2, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. The Special Committee reviewed with Paul, Weiss and PJ Solomon the
current status of the Feldenkreis Proposal. PJ Solomon presented to, and the Special Committee reviewed with PJ Solomon, a preliminary overview of the financing components
of the most recent Feldenkreis Proposal. This presentation reviewed the balance sheet and cash flow of the Company derived from the most recent management plan, the sources
and uses of cash implied by the most recent Feldenkreis Proposal, the debt and equity financing implied by the most recent Feldenkreis Proposal, and the assumed borrowing
base of the Company implied by the most recent Feldenkreis Proposal. A copy of the presentation is attached as exhibit (c)(5) to the Statement on Schedule 13E-3, filed by the
Company and the filing persons listed thereon with the SEC on August 3, 2018. Following this review, the Special Committee directed its advisors to (i) inform Mr. George
Feldenkreis' advisors that the canceling of employee performance-based equity awards (other than Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis') was unacceptable and (ii) propose a reverse
termination fee of $20 million, which represented approximately 4.7% of the equity transaction value. Following the Special Committee meeting, PJ Solomon informed Scope of
the Special Committee's positions. A few hours later Scope informed PJ Solomon that, in light of the significant costs and expenses incurred by the Company or otherwise related
to the proposed transaction, if unvested performance awards for employees were to be paid at closing, Mr. George

Feldenkreis would consider reducing his offer to $27.00. Scope also informed PJ Solomon that Mr. George Feldenkreis would not increase his reverse termination fee above 4%.
The Special Committee then held a second meeting during which it unanimously approved rejecting the latest version of the Feldenkreis Proposal, but telling Mr. George
Feldenkreis that it would reopen discussions when he was prepared to negotiate in good faith.

        On June 3, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Paul, Weiss, PJ Solomon, Olshan and Proskauer discussed the treatment of employee equity awards and Proskauer
circulated alternative proposals, including a proposal in which all time-based restricted stock awards would accelerate and be paid out in cash at the closing, and all performance-
based restricted stock awards would be converted into performance-based retention awards, vesting and payable subject to achievement of performance-based vesting conditions.

        On June 4, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process, including the proposals on employee equity awards. Following discussion,
the Special Committee voted unanimously to reject the proposals offered and offer an alternative proposal in which all time-based stock awards would accelerate and be paid at
the closing and all performance-based stock awards would convert into time-based cash retention awards that would be paid in cash at the time of vesting, provided that Parent
would need to get express availability for this payment in its debt commitments.

        Also on June 4, 2018, Olshan informed Paul, Weiss of two successive deadlines to reach an agreement that day, the failure of which would result in the Feldenkreis Proposal
being withdrawn the following morning. Ultimately, the advisors organized an in-person meeting the following day with Mr. George Feldenkreis.

        On June 5, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Paul, Weiss, PJ Solomon, Mr. George Feldenkreis, Olshan, Proskauer and Scope met at the offices of Olshan to
negotiate the remaining open issues. The parties did not discuss the reverse termination fee amount, but did discuss reverse termination fee triggers and other provisions affecting
certainty of closing, including that Mr. George Feldenkreis would agree to contribute up to $5 million in cash as necessary for any financing shortfall and that the debt
commitment letter in respect of the ABL financing would reflect revised market-flex provisions that would not have the potential to reduce availability at closing. Following the
negotiations and a meeting of the Special Committee, Paul, Weiss circulated to Olshan revised drafts of the merger agreement and various ancillary documents.

        On June 7, 2018, Party C, in connection with the Randa Proposal, executed a non-disclosure agreement, permitting it to receive confidential information in connection with
its evaluation of equity financing for the Randa Proposal. The Special Committee approved of this in writing and, because Party C had previously executed a non-disclosure
agreement in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Party C represented that it had not and agreed that it would not communicate with Mr. George Feldenkreis or Fortress regarding
a transaction after a specified date.

        On June 11, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. PJ Solomon presented to, and the Special Committee reviewed with PJ
Solomon, an updated preliminary overview of the financing components of the most recent Feldenkreis Proposal. This presentation reviewed the balance sheet and cash flow of
the Company derived from the most recent management plan, the sources and uses of cash implied by the most recent Feldenkreis Proposal, the debt and equity financing implied
by the most recent Feldenkreis Proposal, and the assumed borrowing base of the Company implied by the most recent Feldenkreis Proposal. A copy of the presentation is
attached as exhibit (c)(4) to the Statement on Schedule 13E-3, filed by the Company and the filing persons listed thereon with the SEC on August 3, 2018. Following discussion,
the Special Committee directed its advisors to offer a compromise package on all remaining open issues in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal which included provisions
improving the probability of collecting a reverse

termination fee upon certain termination events in exchange for agreeing to accept a reduced size of 4% of equity value for the fee itself.

        On June 12, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis advised that Mr. George Feldenkreis would issue a withdrawal press release at 4:30 p.m.
(Eastern Time) on June 13, 2018 if a deal was not done by then. The Special Committee, through Mr. Scheiner, responded that Paul, Weiss was awaiting a response on the
package of documents circulated on June 11, 2018.

        Also on June 12, 2018, in respect of the Feldenkreis Proposal, Olshan provided a counter proposal that addressed the remaining open points, including the allocation of
financing failure risk with regard to Company management financing covenants and the resolution of matters related to the 2018 Annual Meeting.

        Also on June 12, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. Following this review, the Special Committee agreed to begin
scheduling meetings to review and obtain advisory presentations on the definitive documents representing the Feldenkreis Proposal.

        On June 13, 2018, PJ Solomon spoke with Scope and requested an increase in per share merger consideration, Scope again noted that Mr. George Feldenkreis would not
increase the price of his offer of $27.50 per share to acquire all of the shares of the Company.

        Also on June 13, 2018, after the Board and each standing committee held their annually scheduled meeting, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update
on the process. Following discussion, the Special Committee authorized its advisors to invite AlixPartners to review materials submitted by management to the Board in
connection with quarterly reporting and seek reconfirmation that the March projections had not changed. PJ Solomon advised the Special Committee that it had once more raised
the prospect of a price increase with Scope, addressing with Scope the recent trading of the Company's stock. PJ Solomon relayed that Scope had firmly responded that
Mr. George Feldenkreis would not increase his price.

        Also on June 13, 2018, PJ Solomon spoke with Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis and Mr. George Feldenkreis and Mr. George Feldenkreis stated that he would withdraw his offer if a
deal was not agreed to by 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on June 15, 2018.

        On June 14, 2018, the Special Committee met with Paul, Weiss and Akerman who provided the Special Committee with a review of the Special Committee's fiduciary
duties in the context of evaluating the proposed transaction with Mr. George Feldenkreis. Paul, Weiss then summarized in detail the key terms of the latest drafts of the merger
agreement, the related ancillary agreements and the financing commitments under the Feldenkreis Proposal.

        On June 15, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to receive an update on the process. AlixPartners attended the meeting to confirm that, on information and
belief, they had no reason to adjust their earlier findings, the receipt of which had preceded the Special Committee's direction to PJ Solomon to use the March 2018 projections
for its valuation and fairness analysis. PJ Solomon then provided the Special Committee with an update of Randa's progress, including Randa's stated intention to deliver
financing commitments and an offer in short order. PJ Solomon presented, and the Special Committee reviewed with PJ Solomon, an updated overview of the financing
components of the most recent Feldenkreis Proposal. This presentation reviewed the sources and uses of cash implied by the most recent Feldenkreis Proposal, the debt and
equity financing implied by the most recent Feldenkreis Proposal, and the assumed borrowing base of the Company implied by the most recent Feldenkreis Proposal. A copy of
the presentation is attached as exhibit (c)(3) to the Statement on Schedule 13E-3, filed by the Company and the filing persons listed thereon with the SEC on August 3, 2018. PJ
Solomon then reviewed with the Special Committee the analyses (as summarized below under "Special Factors—Opinion of PJS" beginning on page 56) underlying the fairness
opinion that PJ Solomon was then prepared to issue later that day, if requested by the Special Committee. A

copy of the presentation is attached as exhibit (c)(2) to the Statement on Schedule 13E-3, filed by the Company and the filing persons listed thereon with the SEC on August 3,
2018.

        On the evening of June 15, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to consider the proposed transaction, including the merger agreement and related ancillary
agreements. Paul, Weiss provided a summary of the process that the Special Committee had undertaken since it was formed, and reviewed the fiduciary duties and
responsibilities of the Special Committee. The Special Committee again discussed the terms of the proposed transaction, the risks and consequences of rejecting it, and the fact
that the Company's shareholders would be able to accept or reject the proposed transaction pursuant to the requisite shareholder vote provisions of the merger agreement. After
further discussion, at the request of the Special Committee, PJ Solomon issued an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated June 15,
2018, that, as of such date, and based upon the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by PJ
Solomon in preparing its opinion, the merger consideration of $27.50 in cash per share of common stock of the Company to be paid to the shareholders (other than Parent and its
affiliates) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders. After further discussion, the Special Committee unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the ancillary agreements were fair, advisable, and in the best interests of the unaffiliated
shareholders and recommended that the Board approve the merger, the merger agreement and the related ancillary documents and the transactions contemplated thereby.

        Following the Special Committee meeting, the full Board met on June 15, 2018, and, based in part on the recommendation of the Special Committee, as well as on the basis
of the other factors described in this Proxy Statement (including, among other factors, the financial analyses reviewed and discussed with the Special Committee by PJ Solomon),
which the Board adopted as its own, after acknowledging Mr. George Feldenkreis' and Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis' interest in the transaction, unanimously resolved on behalf of the
Company that the merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement were fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and the unaffiliated shareholders and that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby be recommended to the shareholders for adoption.
Thereafter the Board approved the merger, the merger agreement and the related ancillary agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby.

        Following the meeting, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub executed and delivered the merger agreement, and the ancillary agreements were fully executed and delivered
by the parties thereto. The following morning, the Company issued a press release announcing entry into the merger agreement.

        Other than as described above (including with respect to the reports of PJ Solomon, AlixPartners and Cook), no outside party was asked to provide, or did provide, an
opinion, report or appraisal materially related to the transaction to the Company or any of its affiliates.

Subsequent Events

        On June 20, 2018, Randa delivered a letter to Paul, Weiss reconfirming its earlier non-binding indication of interest without including financing commitments but noting that
draft debt commitment letters would be delivered later that week. The letter reflected the same $27.75 per share merger consideration as had been previously offered by Randa in
its April 5, 2018 non-binding indication of interest, and noted that Randa expected, prior to the execution of definitive documents, to "have the opportunity to converse with
certain principal business relationships (including the inbound licensors and certain key customers) of the Company to confirm their intent to continue such relationships." Paul,
Weiss delivered a copy of the letter to Olshan on June 21, 2018, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

        On June 21, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to discuss the letter received from Randa. Paul, Weiss provided the Special Committee with a review of the
Special Committee's fiduciary duties in the context of receipt of such materials. Following discussion with, and advice from, its legal and financial advisors, including a review
with the Special Committee of their obligations under the non-solicitation provisions of the Feldenkreis merger agreement, the Special Committee directed its advisors not to
respond to Randa's communications at that time. Consistent with the Special Committee's instructions, the Company, the Special Committee and its advisors did not respond to
the letter.

        Also on June 21, 2018, Olshan delivered a letter to Paul, Weiss in which it requested the "prior proposals" referenced in the June 20, 2018 Randa letter (which Paul, Weiss
subsequently delivered to Olshan) and expressed the view, on behalf of Mr. George Feldenkreis, that Randa's reconfirmation was not reasonably expected to lead to a superior
proposal.

        On June 22, 2018, Randa delivered to PJ Solomon revised debt commitment letters. On June 23, 2018, Paul, Weiss delivered the debt commitment letters to Olshan in
accordance with the merger agreement.

        On June 24, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to discuss the documents received from Randa. Paul, Weiss provided the Special Committee with a review of
the Special Committee's fiduciary duties in the context of receipt of such materials. PJ Solomon noted that the revised debt commitment letters still appeared insufficient in terms
of amount and noted that similar issues raised by the advisors as to the drafts received on May 21, 2018 remained unresolved. In addition, the debt commitment letters remained
subject to investment committee approval of one of the lenders and each remained subject to due diligence. Moreover, the structures outlined in the commitments appeared to be
preliminary and conflicting between the debt commitments letters and at least one debt commitment letter, by its terms, terminated prior to termination of the merger agreement.
Following discussion with, and advice from, its legal and financial advisors, the Special Committee directed its advisors not to respond to Randa's communications at that time.
Consistent with the Special Committee's instructions, the Company, the Special Committee and its advisors did not respond to Randa's communications.

        On June 26, 2018, Olshan delivered a letter to Paul, Weiss and reiterated its view, on behalf of Mr. George Feldenkreis, that the communications from Randa were not
reasonably expected to lead to a superior proposal. Olshan requested confirmation from the Special Committee that Randa was not granted permission to access the Company's
confidential information, and would not be, unless the Special Committee determined that such proposal was reasonably expected to lead to a superior proposal and that failure to
provide such access would be inconsistent with the Special Committee's fiduciary duties. Paul, Weiss confirmed in writing the next day that the Special Committee was aware of
and was in full compliance with its duties.

        On June 27, 2018, Randa delivered a letter to Paul, Weiss reconfirming its earlier non-binding indication of interest including a proposed draft of a merger agreement. The
letter reflected the same $27.75 per share merger consideration as had been previously offered by Randa in its April 5, 2018 non-binding indication of interest, but stated that "
[a]ssuming no material change in the terms of the agreements with [the Company's key] inbound licensors, we expect to be in a position to increase our $27.75 per share offer."
Paul, Weiss delivered a copy of the letter to Olshan on June 27, 2018, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

        On June 28, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to discuss the letter and proposed draft of a merger agreement received from Randa. Paul, Weiss provided the
Special Committee with a review of the Special Committee's fiduciary duties in the context of receipt of such materials. Following discussion with, and advice from, its legal and
financial advisors, including a review with the Special Committee of their obligations under the non-solicitation provisions of the Feldenkreis merger agreement, the Special
Committee directed its advisors not to respond to Randa's communications at

that time. Consistent with the Special Committee's instructions, the Company, the Special Committee and its advisors did not respond to the letter.

        On June 30, 2018, Parent entered into an amended and restated commitment letter with Wells Fargo, PNC Capital Market LLC and PNC Bank National Association ("PNC
Bank") pursuant to which PNC Bank was added as a lender under the ABL facility. Olshan delivered notice of this amendment to the Company on July 3, 2018, in accordance
with the terms of the merger agreement.

        On July 1, 2018, Randa delivered a letter to Paul, Weiss reconfirming its earlier non-binding indication of interest, but increasing the per share price to $28.00. Unlike the
June 27, 2018 letter, Randa did not indicate that additional consideration would be offered if its desired conversations with the Company's inbound licensors were favorable to
Randa, but retained its position that as a pre-condition to execution of definitive agreements, Randa would expect to meet with the Company's inbound licensors. Paul, Weiss
delivered a copy of the letter to Olshan on July 1, 2018, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

        On July 2, 2018, Randa issued a press release announcing its proposal to acquire the Company in an all cash transaction for $28.00 per share.

        Also on July 2, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to discuss the letter received from Randa and the press release issued from Randa. Paul, Weiss provided
the Special Committee with a review of the Special Committee's fiduciary duties in the context of receipt of such materials. Following discussion with, and advice from, its legal
and financial advisors, the Special Committee issued a "stop, look and listen" statement in response to the press release issued by Randa in accordance with the terms of the
merger agreement.

        Later on July 2, 2018, the Company's controller notified the Company of his resignation and the Company's CEO informed the Special Committee of his desire to revise the
interim CFO title to permanent CFO and to increase his salary commensurate with the permanent appointment to the CFO role.

        On July 3, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to discuss employee matters and to again discuss the letter received from Randa and the press release issued by
Randa. The Chairman of the Special Committee reported his discussions with the Company's CEO concerning certain employee issues, and Paul, Weiss reported Olshan's
confirmation of consent from Parent under the merger agreement for the title change and salary increase of Mr. Jorge Narino. After discussion, the Special Committee
unanimously approved the same and directed certain Special Committee members to contact the Company's CEO to discuss employee relations measures. Additionally, Paul,
Weiss provided the Special Committee with a review of the Special Committee's fiduciary duties in the context of receipt of materials from Randa. Following discussion with,
and advice from, its legal and financial advisors, the Special Committee determined that the Randa Proposal did not satisfy the requirements in the Feldenkreis merger agreement
for granting due diligence access or commencing discussions or negotiations with respect to a competing takeover proposal. In arriving at its determination, the Special
Committee considered, in relation to a 1.8% potential price increase, among other things, (1) that the proposal was highly-conditional, non-binding and insufficient in terms of
value and certainty of the provided debt financing commitments, as well as the lack of evidence of sufficient cash equity on hand; (2) the additional timing to enter into and
complete a potential transaction with Randa; (3) the history of dealing with Randa over the prior few months (including as to credibility with respect to timing); (4) the inclusion
of an unprecedented 3% fee payable by the Company to Randa if shareholders vote down the transaction, compared to no such penalty if shareholders vote down the Feldenkreis
merger; and (5) a number of other terms affecting shareholder value or certainty were inferior, including termination fees, additional risks to closing, and the lack of appraisal
rights for shareholders. Based on the totality of the circumstances considered in comparison to the potential for a slight price improvement, the Special Committee concluded that
re-engaging with Randa at the price offered was

not in the best interest of shareholders. Upon such determination, the Special Committee approved the issuance of a press release announcing such determination.

        On July 9, 2018, Randa delivered a letter to the Special Committee, which it later made public by press release, noting its disappointment with the lack of direct
communication by the Special Committee to Randa in respect of the Randa Proposal, and outlining its positions with respect to its debt commitment papers, the conditionality of
its proposal, the potential timing of completion of such transaction, and its contemplated merger agreement.

        Also on July 9, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to discuss the update on filing the Proxy Statement and related regulatory filings with respect to the
Feldenkreis Proposal and to discuss the July 9, 2018 letter from Randa. The advisors carefully reviewed with the Special Committee each of the points made in the letter. After
careful consideration, including of the requirements in the Feldenkreis merger agreement for granting due diligence access or commencing discussions or negotiations with
respect to a competing takeover proposal, the Special Committee unanimously directed its advisors not to engage further with Randa at that time. In coming to this determination,
the Special Committee noted that: (a) nothing new in terms of value or certainty was provided in the letter; (b) the letter further confirmed the Special Committee's view that
substantial improvement in price and certainty was not reasonably expected to be offered by Randa; (c) the characterizations of the conditionality in Randa's non-binding
proposal were misleading and incomplete, failing to note, among other things: (i) the highly conditional terms of the debt commitments provided to the Company, (ii) no cash
equity was committed or indicated as likely to be committed (beyond the amount noted in the PJ Solomon meeting with Randa on June 1, 2018 as being insufficient to complete
the transaction), (iii) the third-party change-of-control consent waivers that were to be sought as a pre-condition to signing (as clarified by Randa in its private June 20, 2018
letter), (iv) the added risks and delays in delivering shareholder value that were built into the Randa Proposal, through a "marketing period" delay of almost a month to allow for
debt syndication (not provided in Feldenkreis merger agreement) on top of the delay in timing to execution needed to negotiate third-party consents, financing terms and a form
of merger agreement provided by Randa that was materially different and adverse from the Company's point of view (in both form and substance) as compared to the Feldenkreis
merger agreement, and (v) the merger agreement attached to the non-binding proposal remained less favorable in material respects to the Company's shareholders in terms of
value protection and certainty, including but not limited to extraordinary termination fees potentially payable by the Company, especially when viewed in comparison to the
Feldenkreis merger agreement termination fees, an antitrust condition that does not apply in the Feldenkreis merger agreement (burdensome condition), and the lack of appraisal
rights for shareholders (which are available to shareholders pursuant to the Feldenkreis merger agreement); and (d) the letter ignored the risks under the Feldenkreis merger
agreement in engaging with Randa when it was clearly consistent with Florida law for the Special Committee to discount such an unusually slight (1.8%) topping premium by the
added uncertainties and risks of delays and termination in the Randa Proposal.

        On July 10, 2018, the FTC notified Paul, Weiss that the request for early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act in respect of the proposed acquisition of the
Company by Mr. George Feldenkreis had been granted effective as of the date of such notification.

        On July 15, 2018, in response to Randa's July 9, 2018 press release, with the consent of the Special Committee, Paul, Weiss delivered a letter to legal counsel for Randa,
demanding that Randa (i) confirm destruction of all evaluation material that it received pursuant to the Randa NDA, (ii) cease issuing public statements in violation of the Randa
NDA and (iii) make any future communications related to the Randa Proposal through PJS, as required by the Randa NDA.

        On July 16, 2018, Randa delivered a letter to the Special Committee, which it later made public by press release, complaining about a lack of direct communication by the
Special Committee to Randa in respect of the Randa Proposal, and responding to certain points raised in the Company's preliminary

proxy statement filed on July 11, 2018, with respect to Randa's views relating to its equity financing, its debt commitment papers, the financial strength of its proposal, the
potential timing of completion of such transaction, its contemplated merger agreement, and its belief with respect to the superiority of the Randa Proposal. In addition, on July 16,
2018 legal counsel for Randa delivered a letter to Paul, Weiss objecting to any claims that Randa has violated the terms of the Randa NDA and failing to confirm destruction of
the evaluation material as required by the Randa NDA.

        On July 17, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to discuss the July 16, 2018 letter from Randa and the press release issued by Randa. The advisors carefully
reviewed with the Special Committee each of the points made in the letter. After careful consideration, including of the requirements in the Feldenkreis merger agreement for
granting due diligence access or commencing discussions or negotiations with respect to a competing takeover proposal, the Special Committee unanimously directed its advisors
not to engage further with Randa at that time (other than with respect to the delivery of a letter regarding Randa's continued violations of the Randa NDA). In coming to this
determination, the Special Committee noted that it was the Special Committee's belief that: (i) the Randa Proposal remained highly-conditional, non-binding and insufficient in
terms of value and certainty of the provided debt financing commitments, and lacked evidence of sufficient cash equity on hand, (ii) Randa's financing commitments failed to
account for approximately $32 million of newly proposed mortgage debt indicated as a source of funds and made the entire financing contingent on its level of cash, accounts
receivable and inventory, assets upon which the Special Committee had conducted no diligence and into which the Special Committee had no visibility since Randa is a privately
held company, (iii) the letter mischaracterized the strategic process and included unfounded skepticism regarding the timeline for closing the merger, particularly given that the
Company had already been granted early termination of the 30-day waiting period under the HSR Act, (iv) Randa did not commit to pay the break fee that would be owed to
Mr. George Feldenkreis if the Company enters into a merger agreement with Randa, leaving the Company shareholders to bear the expense of that break fee if Randa does not
close a transaction (which would represent a loss to Company shareholders of approximately $8.7 million (approximately $0.55 per share), undermining the value of the slight
price increase available to shareholders under the Randa Proposal), (v) Randa's proposed merger agreement was materially less favorable to the Company and its shareholders
than the Feldenkreis merger agreement, including with respect to (1) expanding the circumstances under which fees may be payable to Randa in the event of a termination of the
merger agreement; (2) increasing the amount of the break fee payable by the Company and lengthening the period during which such higher fee may be payable if the merger
agreement is terminated; (3) requiring the Company to pay Randa's expenses, up to a cap of 1% of equity transaction value, if Company shareholders vote down the Randa
proposal or if the Company breaches the merger agreement in a manner which gives rise to a Randa termination right; (4) placing substantial additional closing risk on the
Company, in part because of the more onerous disclosure obligations and expanded Company representations and warranties and covenants; (5) not offering appraisal rights to
Company shareholders, which Randa could voluntarily provide under Florida law, while the Feldenkreis merger agreement includes such recourse; and (6) making waiver of
change of control consent rights of third parties a pre-condition to execution of a merger agreement and (vi) Randa continued to persistently violate the terms of the Randa NDA
and failed to confirm the destruction of evaluation material, as noted above.

        On July 18, the Special Committee issued a press release responding to Randa's July 16, 2018 letter, which noted the same considerations the Special Committee
contemplated on July 17, 2018 in coming to its determination not to engage further with Randa at that time with regard to the Randa Proposal.

        Also on July 18, 2018, Paul, Weiss delivered a letter to legal counsel for Randa, demanding that Randa (i) confirm destruction of all evaluation material as required by a
section of the Randa NDA, which states that Randa must "return, destroy or erase . . . all Evaluation Material" "upon the

Company's request . . . ," (ii) cease violating a section of the Randa NDA, which prohibits Randa from, among other things, (1) disclosing the "fact that discussions, negotiations,
or investigations are taking or have taken place concerning a potential Transaction," (2) disclosing the "terms, conditions, or facts relating to the Transaction," and (3) making
"any public statement concerning the Transaction," (iii) cease violating a section of the Randa NDA, which prohibits Randa from "contact[ing] or communicat[ing] with any . . .
Business Relations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries about the Transaction or any Evaluation Material received by [Randa] hereunder in connection with the Transaction"
absent prior approval in writing and (iv) make any future communications related to the Randa Proposal through PJS, as required by the Randa NDA.

        On July 19, 2018, Randa's counsel delivered a letter to the Special Committee noting simply that Randa was aware of it obligations under the Randa NDA, that it had and
would continue to abide by those and that further "back and forth" on the subject would not be productive. The letter also expressed astoundment that the Special Committee
would write about the Randa NDA and not engage on the Randa Proposal. The letter restated the complaint that they had been denied access to speaking to key inbound licensors
and that they had been upfront during the sales process that they would need that access and restated a request to engage on the Randa Proposal. Nothing in the letter
substantively addressed the shortcomings of the Randa Proposal identified in the Company's press release from July 18, 2018. Moreover, the letter conspicuously failed to
confirm the destruction of evaluation material as required by the Randa NDA and avoided engaging substantively on the other violations described by Paul, Weiss in its July 18,
2018 letter.

        On July 27, 2018, Randa delivered a letter to PJS reconfirming its earlier non-binding indication of interest, but increasing the per share merger consideration to $28.90. In
the letter, Randa stated that the offer was conditioned only on execution of its prior proposed merger agreement (subject to removing the concept of a marketing period and
related definitions) and on the Special Committee facilitating and cooperating in a discussion between Randa and the Company's largest inbound licensor. The Company's license
agreement with such licensor requires the consent of such licensor upon a change of control including under the merger. Randa also stated that the financing was fully committed
and not conditioned upon the assets of the Company or Randa at closing. Concurrently with the letter, Randa also delivered an updated debt commitment letter from one of its
lenders, and a draft updated debt commitment letter from its other lender, attached to a highly confident letter from such lender. Randa noted that the latter lender expected to be
able to execute the updated draft debt commitment letter within 72 hours of the Company restoring such lender's access to the virtual data room. Randa's proposal also included
an updated sources and uses document. Paul, Weiss delivered a copy of the documents to Olshan on July 27, 2018, in accordance with the terms of the Feldenkreis merger
agreement.

        On July 29, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to discuss the documents received from Randa. After careful consideration, including the requirements in the
Feldenkreis merger agreement for granting due diligence access or commencing discussions or negotiations with respect to a competing takeover proposal or asking clarifying
questions, the Special Committee unanimously directed its advisors to send a list of clarifying questions to Randa. In coming to this determination, the Special Committee noted
that the offered price of $28.90 represented a 5.1% premium over the Feldenkreis Proposal, but that the Randa Proposal still contained ambiguities including: (a) that the letter
stated the financing would not be conditioned upon "the assets, inventory, accounts receivable or operations of the Company or Randa at the closing," but the provided sources
and uses suggested a borrowing amount beyond the minimum borrowing amount and did not indicate whether any equity would be committed to backstop any financing
shortfall, (b) Randa noted its intent to use balance sheet cash to fund the equity component, but it was unclear to the Special Committee how much cash Randa possessed and
whether or not equity would be committed to backstop any financing shortfall, (c) whether the debt commitment letters were subject to any flex provisions in as much as no fee

letters had been provided, (d) what Randa proposed as a timeline to signing, including specific steps required, in light of the debt commitment letters, (e) who the proposed
borrower under the bridge loan facility would be, and the identity and connection of the proposed parent guarantor in one of its lender's debt commitment letter, and (f) what
comfort Randa expected or required following its discussion with the Company's largest in-bound licensor to move forward with a transaction.

        Also on July 29, 2018, Olshan delivered a letter to Paul, Weiss noting its belief that the Randa Proposal would not lead to a superior proposal and that allowing Randa to
contact the Company's largest licensor could damage the Company. In particular, Olshan noted its client's beliefs that: (a) Randa previously breached the Randa NDA by
contacting certain licensors of the Company without the consent of the Company and issuing press releases with details of its revised proposals and that Randa could continue to
breach the Randa NDA, (b) Randa requested 72 hours to speak with the Company's largest licensor, but 72 hours would not be enough time for the licensor to make any decision,
particularly in light of Randa's lack of experience with apparel and Oscar Feldenkreis' belief that the Company's largest licensor would not consent to a transaction with Randa,
(c) permitting Randa to resume diligence would create uncertainty that could harm the Company's relationships with its employees and business partners, (d) the transaction
contemplated by the Feldenkreis merger agreement could close months before the Randa Proposal could close, (e) neither Mr. George Feldenkreis nor Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis
would support the Randa Proposal at $28.90 per share, (f) the Randa Proposal did not appear to provide for the up-front payment by Randa of the Company termination fee in the
amount of $8,736,000 payable under the Feldenkreis merger agreement, (g) the Randa Proposal, like the Feldenkreis merger agreement, included a reverse termination fee of 4%,
but such reverse termination fee was insufficient to protect the Company in connection with the Randa Proposal, and (h) Randa's goal may have been to disrupt the Company and
the Feldenkreis merger agreement rather than to complete a transaction with the Company.

        On July 30, 2018, Randa delivered a letter to Paul, Weiss responding to the Special Committee's July 29, 2018 clarifying questions. In the letter, Randa stated that (a) one of
its lenders agreed to provide an additional $25 million in minimum borrowing availability, (b) an affiliate of Randa would provide an additional $20 million in bridge financing,
(c) Randa would be willing to covenant that no cash will be removed from Randa other than in the ordinary course of business during pendency of its transaction, (d) one of its
debt commitments was subject to customary flex provisions and the other was not subject to flex provisions, with a redacted copy of the applicable fee letter with the flex
provisions provided, (e) its other lender expected it will need 72 hours from the time at which Randa resolved its outstanding diligence issue regarding its meeting with the
Company's key licensor to complete their remaining due diligence, (f) the two lenders were in the process of negotiating an intercreditor agreement on customary terms and
(g) assuming a productive meeting with the Company's largest in-bound licensor in which Randa is able to reach an appropriate level of comfort with the licensor's post-closing
plans with the Company, then Randa could move forward without a written change of control waiver from such licensor. Concurrently with the letter, Randa also delivered
(i) bank-statements of the Randa affiliate as of June 30, 2018, that showed more than $20 million in funds available to backstop the bridge financing, (ii) Randa's 2018 monthly
balance sheet with actual results through June 30, 2018 and projections for July to December 2018, and (iii) redacted fee letters from its two lenders. However, among other
things, Randa did not (w) provide any information beyond a current bank statement as to the financial condition of its affiliate that would provide the bridge financing,
(x) indicate what it would do if its discussions with the Company's largest in-bound licensor did not go well, (y) proffer any guarantee or security for payment of any reverse
termination fee that may become payable by Randa, as Mr. George Feldenkreis provided in connection with the Feldenkreis merger agreement, or (z) clarify its timeline for its
proposed transaction. A copy of the July 30, 2018 Randa response was shared with Olshan on July 31, 2018, in accordance with the terms of the Feldenkreis merger agreement.

        On July 31, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors to discuss the materials received from Randa on July 30, 2018. PJ Solomon presented to, and the Special
Committee reviewed with PJ Solomon, an updated preliminary overview of the financing components and significant terms of the most recent Randa Proposal. The presentation
reviewed the sources and uses of cash implied by the most recent Randa Proposal, the debt and equity financing implied by the most recent Randa Proposal, and the assumed
combined borrowing base of the Company and Randa implied by the most recent Randa Proposal. The analysis highlighted significant changes from the proposal originally
received on June 22, 2018, including expansion of the term loan under one of Randa's debt commitments, the addition of a bridge loan under such debt commitment, a potential
increase in the minimum guaranteed borrowing at close under the other debt commitment, and potential additional bridge financing by Randa. A copy of the presentation is
attached as exhibit (c)(8) to the Statement on Schedule 13E-3, filed by the Company and the filing persons listed thereon with the SEC on August 20, 2018. After careful
consideration, and in accordance with the terms of the Feldenkreis merger agreement, the Special Committee unanimously determined to commence discussions with, and
granted due diligence access to, Randa, based on the fact that (a) after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, the Randa Proposal would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal (as such term is defined in the Feldenkreis merger agreement) and (b) after consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to (x) furnish access
and non-public information with respect to the Company and any of its subsidiaries to Randa pursuant to the Randa NDA and (y) participate in discussions and negotiations
regarding the Randa Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties. In coming to this determination, the Special Committee noted that (i) the
offered price of $28.90 per share of Company Common Stock represented a 5.1% premium over the Feldenkreis Proposal, (ii) the revised financing plans appeared reasonably
capable of execution and appeared to give the Randa Proposal sufficient cushion and (iii) Randa's willingness to move forward without a written waiver from the Company's
largest in-bound licensor (assuming a productive meeting with the licensor in which Randa is able to reach an appropriate level of comfort with the licensor's post-closing plans
with the Company) significantly improved the capability of execution for the Randa Proposal. In coming to this decision, the Special Committee also considered, among other
things, the concerns highlighted by Olshan in its July 29, 2018 letter to Paul, Weiss. The Special Committee also directed Paul, Weiss, given Randa's prior, repeated violations of
the Randa NDA, to contact counsel for Randa and get clarification regarding Randa's position under the Randa NDA and to seek reasonable confirmation from Randa that it
would be expected to fully comply with the Randa NDA before being granted further access to the data room.

        On August 1, 2018, legal counsel for Randa confirmed to Paul, Weiss that Randa would agree to abide by the Company's interpretation of the Randa NDA for a specified
period under an understanding designed to provide Randa with an opportunity to (a) have a discussion arranged by the Special Committee with an inbound licensor of the
Company and a reasonable opportunity for follow-up and (b) provide definitive financing commitments not subject to due diligence or investment committee approvals following
such discussion and follow-up, while also protecting the Company from unauthorized public statements concerning a potential transaction or unauthorized contact with its
business relations.

        On August 2, 2018, Olshan delivered a letter to Paul, Weiss in which Olshan stated, on behalf of Mr. George Feldenkreis: (a) Olshan's belief, in view of Randa's clear,
repeated breaches of the Randa NDA, including, without limitation: (i) impermissible public statements about the transaction; (ii) unauthorized communications with key
business relations of the Company; and (iii) failure to return the Company's confidential information, the Special Committee must insist on Randa's strict adherence to the
Company's interpretation of the Randa NDA at all times; (b) the Special Committee's failure to do so substantially dilutes and weakens the Randa NDA such that it no longer
constitutes an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" (as defined in the Feldenkreis merger agreement) that would allow the Special Committee to provide access and non-
public information with respect to the

Company to Randa under the Feldenkreis merger agreement, and that, accordingly, any purported superior proposal that may arise out of such due diligence access would be
obtained in violation of the no solicitation covenant in the Feldenkreis merger agreement; (c) it seriously questioned the Special Committee's apparent willingness to tolerate
Randa—in violation of the express terms of the Randa NDA—agitating for a transaction outside of the negotiated process for an alternative transaction contained in the
Feldenkreis merger agreement, not only impermissibly putting Randa in a more favorable position than Mr. George Feldenkreis would be in if the roles were reversed, but more
critically, effectively condoning conduct by Randa that has already damaged, and has the potential to significantly further damage, the Company's business in the event that
discussions with Randa prove fruitless; (d) despite Randa's persistent violations of the Randa NDA, the Special Committee inexplicably, and contrary to the terms of the
Feldenkreis merger agreement, continues to give Randa preferential treatment, commencing with a $750,000 expense reimbursement that was not disclosed to Mr. George
Feldenkreis prior to signing as required by the Feldenkreis merger agreement, failing to enforce the Randa NDA, and now allowing Randa an indeterminate length of time in
which to conduct its due diligence; (e) the uncertainty surrounding this due diligence poses a significant risk and long-term damage to the Company, as it further jeopardizes the
Company's relationship with its licensors, suppliers and employees, which could result in a material adverse effect under the Feldenkreis merger agreement; (f) the actions of the
Special Committee described above do not serve the best interests of the Company and its shareholders; (g) the Special Committee must ensure that Randa is playing on a level
field with Mr. George Feldenkreis, including by ensuring that Randa agrees to be bound by restrictions in the Randa NDA that are at least as stringent as those with which
Mr. George Feldenkreis has fully complied, otherwise Mr. George Feldenkreis may be compelled to take any and all actions in response to the Special Committee's and Randa's
recurrent derelictions that he deems to be in the best interests of shareholders; and (h) Mr. George Feldenkreis reserves all rights under the Feldenkreis merger agreement and
otherwise.

        Also on August 2, 2018, following receipt of Olshan's August 2, 2018 letter, Paul, Weiss requested further clarification of Randa's intent under the Randa NDA in light of
the concerns expressed by Olshan. Later that evening, legal counsel for Randa confirmed, on behalf of Randa and without prejudice to Randa's interpretation of the Randa NDA,
that Randa agreed to comply with the Special Committee's interpretation of the Randa NDA at all times from and after the date of such confirmation. In light of such
confirmation, and pursuant to the Special Committee's direction, advisors for the Special Committee commenced to arrange discussions and due diligence access for Randa
pursuant to the determination made by the Special Committee on July 31, 2018 and notified counsel for each of Randa and Mr. George Feldenkreis of same.

        On August 3, 2018, the Special Committee issued a "stop, look and listen" statement in advance of the filing of this amendment to the Company preliminary proxy
statement.

        Also on August 3, 2018, advisors to the Special Committee re-opened Randa's access to the Company's virtual data room and commenced addressing additional due
diligence requests made by Randa. On or about August 4, 2018, the advisors and a member of the Special Committee also contacted the Company's largest inbound licensor
seeking an opportunity for Randa to have a discussion with such licensor. Both the Company (through the Special Committee and its advisors) and Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis
discussed with such licensor Randa's proposal and the consent rights under the License (as defined below) in connection therewith. With respect to those discussions by the
Company (through the Special Committee and its advisors), they were aimed at satisfying Randa's precondition of a positive meeting with such licensor. With respect to those
discussions by Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis, they occurred intermittently as a result of publicity by Randa of its proposal and were aimed at assuring such licensor that its relationship
with the Company would not be affected and that such licensor's consent rights would be respected.

        On August 7, 2018, Olshan delivered a letter to Paul, Weiss in which Olshan, on behalf of Mr. George Feldenkreis, (a) conveyed its understanding that Randa had submitted
an additional due diligence request to the Company, which it considered astonishing because Randa had access to over 75,000 pages of documents from the Company since
March of this year, (b) stated its belief that no further information should be provided, (c) reminded the Special Committee that the only diligence item on which Randa's latest
proposal was conditioned was a discussion with the Company's largest inbound licensor, and (d) cautioned that Randa's latest due diligence request confirms Parent's concern,
previously communicated in Olshan's August 2, 2018 letter, that the Special Committee is allowing Randa to conduct open-ended and seemingly interminable due diligence that
not only destroys employee morale but also risks permanent and long-term damage to the Company's business. The letter continued, in the event the Special Committee chose to
disregard all of this and nonetheless provide additional information to Randa, by (i) reminding the Special Committee of its obligations under the Feldenkreis merger agreement
to promptly provide copies of that information to Parent and to keep Parent informed on a current basis of the status of Randa's proposal (as to which Parent had not received any
updates, including as to its lender's willingness to proceed with the financing for Randa's proposal on a non-conditional basis), (ii) noting that the Feldenkreis merger agreement
does not provide that the Company can be required to generate or create any new information that does not currently exist, and (iii) expressing concern that unending requests
and any undertaking to provide information that the Company has no obligation to prepare or provide would only cause further delay of the Special Meeting, in violation of the
Company's obligations under the Feldenkreis merger agreement. The letter further stated that it is clear that, given Randa's misrepresentations regarding the scope and completion
of its due diligence, its clear lack of readiness to proceed and its continued failure to honor its commitments, contractual or otherwise (including repeated violations of the Randa
NDA), the Special Committee had no basis to conclude that Randa's proposal would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal. The letter concluded by stating that
(x) the Special Committee needs to put an end to Randa's fishing expedition so that Parent and the Company can proceed with their transaction that provides substantial and
certain value to the Company's unaffiliated shareholders, (y) to do otherwise puts the Company at risk of breaching its obligations under the Feldenkreis merger agreement and
jeopardizes the transaction that it already has in hand, actions that would constitute breaches of the Special Committee's fiduciary obligations to the Company's shareholders and
for which Parent will hold the Special Committee fully accountable, and (z) to stem further defections of Company employees and maintain key business relations, the Special
Committee should immediately and publicly reconfirm its commitment to the Feldenkreis transaction.

        On August 8, 2018, Paul, Weiss delivered a letter to Olshan in which Paul, Weiss, on behalf of the Special Committee, (a) conveyed that the Special Committee is well
aware of its obligations under the Feldenkreis merger agreement and its fiduciary duties, and that the Special Committee and Company have complied with their obligations and
duties, and will continue to do so, (b) reminded Olshan that the Feldenkreis merger agreement does not limit the due diligence the Company can provide to Randa, so long as
copies of the information are made available to Parent, and that Mr. George Feldenkreis would automatically be notified when a document was added to the data room,
(c) informed Olshan that the Special Committee had not provided an update regarding the Randa Proposal because there was nothing to report, and (d) explained that Randa's 72-
hour window to provide signed financing commitment letters did not, by the terms of the proposal as clarified on July 30, 2018, begin to run until Randa met with the Company's
largest inbound licensor.

        Also on August 8, 2018, the Special Committee delivered a letter to Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis in which the Special Committee (a) advised Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis that the
Special Committee determined it was in the best interests of the Company's shareholders to provide reasonable due diligence access to Randa, (b) instructed Mr. Oscar
Feldenkreis that he and the Company's other officers must comply in a timely manner with all reasonable diligence requests, (c) noted that the Company had not yet provided any
information in response to Randa's August 6, 2018 diligence

requests, and (d) requested that the Company provide (1) the actual income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement for June 2018 year-to-date and July 2018 year-to-
date when available and (2) to the extent such information is gathered in the ordinary course of business, revenue and gross margin by brand for June 2018 year-to-date and July
2018 year-to-date when available. In response to the Special Committee's August 8, 2018 letter, Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis delivered a letter to the Special Committee in which he
noted that (a) the executives other than him had received the diligence requests on August 6, 2018, but were unable to commence work on responses until August 7, 2018 because
of a technical issue, (b) the requested income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement for June 2018 year-to-date were provided on August 10, 2018, (c) the income
statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement for July 2018 year-to-date would be made available shortly after they are finalized, (d) the Company's officers and employees
were all instructed to work diligently to generate the requested information as quickly as possible, and (e) that it was in everyone's best interest not to delay resolution of the
situation.

        Also on August 8, 2018, the Special Committee's advisors discussed the Company's request for a Randa meeting with the executive at the Company's largest inbound
licensor in charge of the Company's relationship with such licensor. In that discussion with such executive, the executive made clear to the advisors of the Special Committee
that: (i) he had already spoken to Randa (without the Special Committee's authorization); (ii) he had substantive concerns regarding Randa's lack of experience in apparel;
(iii) based on the substantive criteria the licensor applied to consider granting consent (which criteria he explained to such advisors), the judgment reached by the licensor
(including based on Randa's earlier discussion with him) was that such criteria were not met by Randa; and (iv) he refused to have another discussion with Randa. The executive
also indicated that he would send an email confirming the licensor's position, after he consulted with others in his organization.

        On August 9, 2018, Randa delivered a letter to the Special Committee in which Randa (a) expressed frustration that (1) the Special Committee had yet to facilitate an
interview with the Company's largest inbound licensor, (2) it believed that Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis was scheduled to meet with the licensor the following week and (3) the
Company had not responded to Randa's diligence requests, and (b) reaffirmed its commitment to the Randa Proposal. Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis subsequently communicated to the
Special Committee that his meeting with the Company's largest inbound licensor had been set in July in connection with his yearly attendance at an annual industry apparel show,
which meeting was held on August 16, 2018.

        On August 10, 2018, the Company's largest inbound licensor informed PJS in writing that, if Randa acquires the Company, then such licensor would exercise its contractual
rights and either put out a request for proposal for the license (the "License"), which Randa could bid on, or would grant the License to one of its current licensees. The licensor
added that it is not in such licensor's best interests at this time to give the License to Randa if Randa were to acquire the Company. The Special Committee shared the licensor's
email with Randa and delivered a letter to Randa asking for clarification as to (a) whether Randa would waive the pre-condition that it meet with the Company's largest inbound
licensor and (b) when the Special Committee could expect to receive definitive financing documents and Randa's position on the form of merger agreement, neither of which had
yet been received by the Special Committee.

        On August 11, 2018, Randa contacted PJS and suggested that the only way Randa could reach a deal with the Company was if Mr. George Feldenkreis and Mr. Oscar
Feldenkreis agreed to support the Randa transaction and to help Randa retain the Company's largest inbound licensor following the closing of such transaction. Randa suggested
that it could raise its price from $28.90 per share if they each would agree to support a transaction with Randa. Paul, Weiss and PJS spoke with Olshan and Scope, respectively, to
convey Randa's message to Mr. George Feldenkreis. Olshan and Scope relayed that Mr. George Feldenkreis, in his capacity as a shareholder, was uninterested in selling his
shares to Randa or supporting the Randa Proposal and further expressed the view that continued discussions and

diligence regarding the Randa Proposal was unlikely to lead to a superior proposal under the Feldenkreis merger agreement, because he could not control the decisions of the
Company's largest inbound licensor, and nevertheless, Randa had no financing in place, nor were the terms of a definitive agreement agreed upon.

        On August 12, 2018, PJS communicated Mr. George Feldenkreis' response to Randa.

        On August 13, 2018, Randa delivered a letter to the Special Committee in which Randa (a) reiterated its interest in acquiring the Company (b) noted that it would be
prepared to increase its price if Mr. George Feldenkreis and Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis would support the Randa Proposal and assist the Company in obtaining the requisite consent
of the Company's largest inbound licensor, and (c) acknowledged that failing support of the transaction including in respect of further discussions with such licensor, it had no
viable path to a transaction between Randa and the Company.

        Also on August 13, 2018, the Special Committee met with its advisors and received an update on the process including review of the licensor communications and the letter
from Randa. Following consultation with its advisors, the Special Committee determined that, subject to (a) conferring with representatives of Mr. George Feldenkreis and
Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis regarding their reactions to Randa's letter and confirming that, in their capacity as shareholders, they remained opposed to selling their shares to Randa,
(b) conferring with Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis in his capacity as the Company's CEO regarding whether additional actions should be taken with respect to seeking licensor consent,
and (c) subsequent approval of the press release announcing the Special Committee's determination, the Randa Proposal was no longer reasonably likely to lead to a superior
proposal under the Feldenkreis merger agreement and the Company should terminate discussions and cease providing further diligence information to Randa. The determination
of whether the Company's largest inbound licensor would consent to a change of control was solely within the control of such licensor.

        Also on August 13, 2018, Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis sent a letter to the Special Committee in which he stated that he was aware of his fiduciary duties as a director and CEO of
the Company and that the Licensor had come to its own decision regarding Randa, and he further refuted the suggestion that the Feldenkreis' or anyone else at the Company
control that decision. Further, Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis stated his belief that Randa's efforts to identify hurdles for others to jump did not excuse its failure to complete its diligence,
provide evidence of committed financing or agree to the terms of a definitive agreement.

        On August 14, 2018, the Company issued a press release as approved by the Special Committee (a) disclosing the letter from Randa dated August 13, 2018, (b) announcing
that the Special Committee (i) determined, following consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that the Randa Proposal was no longer reasonably likely to lead to
a Superior Proposal under the Feldenkreis merger agreement, including due to the fact that, based on communications received from the Company's largest inbound licensor, it
became clear that the key inbound licensor precondition to the Randa Proposal was not likely to be satisfied irrespective of any action taken by Mr. George Feldenkreis and
Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis, and (ii) terminated discussions with Randa in accordance with the terms of the Feldenkreis merger agreement, and (c) reiterating the Special Committee's
support of the Feldenkreis merger agreement. In approving such announcement regarding the precondition being unlikely to be satisfied irrespective of any action taken by
Mr. George Feldenkreis and Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis, the Special Committee understood that (x) in their fiduciary roles at the Company the Feldenkreis' actions were unlikely to
overturn the determination made by such licensor, which was a much larger organization than the Company and had made its determination in accordance with its own
established criteria and (y) in their shareholder capacities, the Feldenkreises were neither willing nor obligated to support the Randa transaction or provide Randa with assistance
post-closing in meeting such criteria.

        Also on August 14, 2018, the Company terminated Randa's access to the data room.

        On August 15, 2018, the Company requested return or destruction of confidential information concerning the Company in accordance with the Randa NDA.

        On August 27, 2018, Mr. George Feldenkreis and Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis formally requested the consent of the Company's largest inbound licensor to the change of control
which will occur on the closing of the merger. On September 7, 2018, the Company's largest inbound licensor granted such consent.

Recommendation of the Special Committee and Our Board of Directors; Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement; Fairness of the Merger 

        On June 15, 2018, the Special Committee, after careful consideration, voted unanimously to recommend to the board of directors that it, and thereafter the board of
directors, after careful consideration and acknowledging the interest of George Feldenkreis and Oscar Feldenkreis in the merger, voted unanimously to (i) approve and declare
advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) declare that it is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
the unaffiliated shareholders of the Company that the Company enter into the merger agreement and consummate the merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the merger agreement, (iii) direct that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the shareholders of the Company and (iv) recommend to the
shareholders of the Company that they vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement.

        In evaluating the merger, the Special Committee and the board of directors consulted with the Company's senior management and outside legal and financial advisors and, in
reaching their respective determinations, the Special Committee and the board of directors considered a number of factors that they believed supported their decision to approve
and recommend the merger agreement and the merger, including, but not limited to, the following:

• the $27.50 per share to be paid in respect of each share of Company Common Stock represents: (i) a premium of 21.6%, based on the closing price per share of
Company Common Stock on the Undisturbed Date of $22.62; (ii) a premium of 14.0% based on the volume weighted average price per share of Company
Common Stock for the 90-day period ending on the Undisturbed Date of $24.13; (iii) a premium of 11.1% based on the volume weighted average price per share
of Company Common Stock for the 60-day period ending on the Undisturbed Date of $24.75; (iv) a premium of 9.4% based on the volume weighted average
price per share of Company Common Stock for the 30-day period ending on the Undisturbed Date of $25.14; (v) a premium of 5.8% based on the highest closing
price per share of Company Common Stock for the 52-week period ending on the Undisturbed Date of $25.99; and (vi) a discount of 4.5% based on the highest
closing price per share of Company Common Stock for the 5-year period ending on the Undisturbed Date of $28.80; 

• the current and historical market prices for the Company Common Stock, including those set forth in the table in the section captioned "Markets and Market
Price," which has a median closing price of $22.28 for the 52-week period ending on the Undisturbed Date; 

• the Company Common Stock traded as low as $16.35 during the 52 weeks prior to the announcement of the June 15, 2018 execution of the merger agreement; 

• the global and U.S. domestic retail economies have experienced unprecedented contraction which has had a dramatic adverse impact on the Company's customer
base and forced multiple distribution outlets and retailers to file for bankruptcy; 

• the fact that the Special Committee and the board of directors believed that the $27.50 per share price to be paid in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock was the highest

price that George Feldenkreis and his related parties would be willing to pay and represented the best value reasonably available to the Company's unaffiliated
shareholders;

• the fact that the $27.50 per share merger consideration was below the ranges of values per share of Company Common Stock indicated by certain of the selected
companies analyses presented by PJS viewed in the context of the $27.50 per share merger consideration being within the ranges of values per share of Company
Common Stock indicated by other analyses presented by PJS. For a summary of these financial analyses presented by PJS, see "Special Factors—Opinion of PJS"
beginning on page 56; 

• the fact that the consideration to be paid in the proposed merger is all cash, which provides certainty of value and liquidity to the unaffiliated shareholders and
allows the unaffiliated shareholders not to be exposed to the risks and uncertainties relating to the prospects of the Company (including the prospects described in
management's projections summarized under "Special Factors—Projected Financial Information" beginning on page 74); 

• the possibility that it could take a considerable period of time before, and that there could be significant uncertainty as to whether, the trading price of Company
Common Stock would reach and sustain a trading price of at least equal to the per share merger consideration of $27.50, as adjusted for present value, following
any withdrawal of George Feldenkreis' offer; 

• the Special Committee's and board of directors' belief, based on their knowledge of the business, operations, management, financial condition, earnings and
prospects of the Company, including the prospects of the Company as a stand-alone company, that the merger is desirable at this time, as compared with other
times in the Company's operating history; 

• the possible alternatives to the merger, including, but not limited to, selling the Company to another acquiror, continuing as a stand-alone company or effecting a
leveraged recapitalization, which alternatives the Special Committee and board of directors evaluated with the assistance of the Company's senior management
and advisors and determined were likely to be less favorable to the Company's shareholders than the merger given the potential risks and uncertainties associated
with those alternatives; 

• the fact that after a long a public process, which consisted of a strategic alternative review process whereby PJS contacted 18 parties (9 private equity and 9
strategic), only one other bidder for all of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company, and
after months of diligence such bidder was unable to arrange its financing; 

• the Special Committee's determination that the Randa Proposal was not reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; 

• the opinion of PJS, dated June 15, 2018, to the Special Committee as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the $27.50
in cash per share to be paid to the shareholders (other than Parent and its affiliates), including the Company's "unaffiliated security holders" (as defined in
Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act), pursuant to the merger agreement, as well as the related financial presentation, both of which the Special Committee and
board of directors expressly adopted. See "Special Factors—Opinion of PJS" beginning on page 56; 

• the likelihood that the merger would be completed based on, among other things (not in any relative order of importance): 

• the Special Committee's and board of directors' belief that the debt financing required for the merger will be obtained, given (i) the fact that Parent had
obtained commitments for

financing;

• the absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement; 

• the likelihood and anticipated timing of completing the merger in light of the scope of the closing conditions; 

• the Special Committee's and board of directors' belief that no significant antitrust or other regulatory issue exists and that the required antitrust approval is
expected to be obtained; 

• the fact that (i) Parent will be required to pay to the Company a reverse termination fee of $17.472 million if the merger agreement is terminated under
certain circumstances, (ii) the Company will not need to prove damages as a condition to receiving such reverse termination fee, (iii) George Feldenkreis
has executed a limited guarantee in favor of the Company guaranteeing Parent's obligation to pay such reverse termination fee and (iv) George
Feldenkreis' guarantee is supported by George Feldenkreis' pledge of 647,451 certificated shares of Company Common Stock, which are currently held in
escrow; 

• the Company's right to seek specific performance of Parent's obligations under the merger agreement, including, under certain circumstances, specific
performance of Parent's obligations to cause each Rollover Investor to make the equity contribution to Parent pursuant to such Rollover Investor's equity
commitment letter; and 

• George Feldenkreis' execution of a limited guarantee and pledge and security agreement in favor of the Company guaranteeing (and pledging collateral in
support of such guarantee), subject to the limitations described therein, the payment of certain payment obligations that may be owed by Parent pursuant to
the merger agreement, including the payment of any reverse termination fee that may become payable following termination of the merger agreement in
specified circumstances, subject to an overall cap of $17.472 million. 

• the other terms of the merger agreement and the related agreements, including: 

• the Special Committee's and the board of directors' ability to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify its recommendation that the Company's shareholders
vote to adopt the merger agreement, subject to certain conditions in the merger agreement; 

• the Special Committee's and the board of directors' ability to (i) respond to takeover proposals and (ii) terminate the merger agreement for a superior
proposal prior to adoption of the merger agreement by the Company's shareholders, in each case, subject to certain conditions in the merger agreement,
including in the case of a termination of the merger agreement, the payment of a termination fee of $8.736 million by the Company; 

• the termination fee of $8.736 million payable by the Company to Parent under certain circumstances, including as described above, in connection with a
termination of the merger agreement, which the Special Committee and board of directors concluded was reasonable in the context of termination fees
payable in comparable transactions and considering the overall terms of the merger agreement, including the per share merger consideration of $27.50; 

• the fact that the voting agreement entered into by the Rollover Investors with Parent and the Company will terminate automatically if the merger
agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, including a termination of the merger agreement for a superior proposal prior to adoption of the

seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of Company Common Stock in lieu of receiving the per share merger consideration as determined by the
state and federal courts in Miami-Dade County, State of Florida.

        The Special Committee and board of directors also believed that sufficient procedural safeguards were and are present to ensure the fairness of the merger and to permit the
Special Committee and board of directors to represent effectively the interests of the Company's unaffiliated shareholders. These procedural safeguards include, but are not
limited to, the following:

• the fact that the Special Committee consists solely of independent and disinterested directors who are not officers or employees of the Company or affiliated with
the GF Group; 

• the fact that the board of directors vested the Special Committee with the exclusive power and authority of the board of directors to take any and all actions it
considers necessary, desirable or appropriate: (1) to evaluate the terms and conditions and determine the advisability of the Feldenkreis Proposal, or any
alternative thereto, and whether in the judgment of the Special Committee the Feldenkreis Proposal, or any alternative thereto, is advisable, fair and in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders; (2) to negotiate with any party the Special Committee deems appropriate with respect to the terms and conditions of
the Feldenkreis Proposal, or any alternative thereto, and, if the Special Committee deems appropriate and permissive under applicable law, approve the execution
and delivery of documents in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Feldenkreis Proposal, or any alternative thereto, on behalf of the Company;
(3) to determine whether the Feldenkreis Proposal or any alternative thereto negotiated by the Special Committee is beneficial to the Company and its
shareholders; and (4) to recommend to the full board of directors what action, if any, should be taken by the board of directors with respect to the Feldenkreis
Proposal, or any alternative thereto; 

• the recognition by the Special Committee that it had the authority not to recommend the merger or any other transaction to the board of directors; 

• the recognition by the independent directors that they, collectively representing a majority of the board of directors, had the authority not to approve the merger or
any other transaction; 

• the fact that each of the members of the Special Committee (comprised of all independent directors) unanimously voted to recommend to the board of directors
that it, and thereafter the board of directors unanimously voted to, approve and declare advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, and declare that it is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the unaffiliated shareholders of the Company that
the Company enter into the merger agreement and consummate the merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement; 

• the fact that the Special Committee was advised by PJS, as financial advisor, and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Akerman LLP, as legal
advisors, each an internationally recognized firm selected by the Special Committee; and

outstanding shares of Company Common Stock not owned by the Rollover Investors or officers or directors of the Company.

        In the course of its deliberations, the Special Committee and board of directors also considered a variety of risks and other countervailing factors related to the merger
agreement and the merger, including, but not limited to, the following:

• the risk that the merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all, including the risk that the merger might not be completed because the financing

financing commitments, described under the caption "Special Factors—Financing of the Merger" beginning on page 78, is not obtained, as Parent does not on its
own possess sufficient funds to complete the merger;

• the risk that all of the conditions to the parties' obligations to effect the merger will not be satisfied prior to the termination date set forth in the merger agreement; 

• the fact that the Company's unaffiliated shareholders will not have any equity in the surviving company following the merger, meaning that the Company's
unaffiliated shareholders will cease to participate in the Company's future earnings or growth, or to benefit from any increases in the value of the equity in the
Company; 

• the restrictions on the conduct of the Company's business prior to the completion of the merger, which may delay or prevent the Company from pursuing business
opportunities that may arise or taking any other action it would otherwise take with respect to its business operations; 

• the risk that, while the closing of the merger is pending, there could be disruptive effects on the business, customer relationships and employees of the Company; 

• the fact that, on June 15, 2018 (the date of execution of the merger agreement), the closing sale price of the Company Common Stock was higher than the per
share merger consideration; 

• the risk of incurring substantial expenses related to the merger, including in connection with any future litigation; 

• the fact that the Company could be required to pay a termination fee of $8.736 million if the merger agreement was terminated under certain circumstances,
including, but not limited to, a termination of the merger agreement by Parent after the board of directors or Special Committee had withdrawn, modified or
amended its recommendation in respect of the merger and the merger agreement in a manner adverse to Parent; 

• the absence of a "go-shop" provision in the merger agreement that would permit the Company to actively solicit a superior proposal after execution of the merger
agreement; 

• the fact that George Feldenkreis has a "last look" right with respect to superior proposals received by the Company and that George Feldenkreis may not support
any such alternative transactions; 

• the possibility that the termination fee of $8.736 million payable by the Company upon the termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances could
discourage potential acquirors from making a competing bid to acquire the Company; 

• the fact that the Company will generally be required, if the proposed merger is not completed, to pay its own expenses associated with the merger agreement, the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; 

• the fact that (i) Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed companies with essentially no assets other than the equity commitments of the Rollover Investors,
(ii) the Company's remedy in the event of breach of the merger agreement by Parent or Merger Sub could be limited to receipt of the reverse termination fee of
$17.472 million, collateralized only by certain certificated shares of Company Common Stock pledged by George Feldenkreis, and (iii) under certain
circumstances, the Company would not be entitled to any reverse termination fee if the merger agreement was terminated; 

• the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to the Company's shareholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and

• the fact that certain of our directors and executive officers have interests in the transaction that are different from, or in addition to, those of our unaffiliated
shareholders; see the section captioned "Special Factors—Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 83.

        In evaluating the merger and in reaching its determination as to the fairness of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Special Committee and the board
of directors considered the factors set forth above, including an evaluation of the going concern value of the Company. The Special Committee and the board of directors did not
consider liquidation value as a factor because they consider the Company to be a viable going concern business and the trading history of the Company Common Stock to
generally be an indication of its value as such. In addition, due to the fact that the Company is being sold as a going concern, the Special Committee and the board of directors
did not consider the liquidation value of the Company relevant to a determination as to whether the proposed merger is fair to the Company's unaffiliated shareholders as the
Special Committee and the board of directors believed the value of the Company's assets that might be realized in a liquidation would be significantly less than its going concern
value. The Special Committee also did not consider net book value, which is an historical accounting measure, in determining the fairness of the merger to the Company and its
shareholders (other than the GF Group Filing Persons), including the unaffiliated shareholders, because of its belief that net book value is not a material indicator of the value of
the Company as a going concern but rather is indicative of historical acquisition costs and therefore not a relevant measure in the determination of the fairness of the merger. Net
book value does not take into account the prospects of the Company, contingent liabilities, market conditions, trends in the industries in which the Company operates or the
business risks inherent in those industries. Further, the Special Committee did not believe that net book value accurately reflects the Company's present market value. The
Company's net book value per share of Company Common Stock as of June 15, 2018 was approximately $24.35, which is lower than the $27.50 per share merger consideration
and higher than the $22.62 closing price of the Company Common Stock on the Undisturbed Date, and the Company's tangible net book value per share of Company Common
Stock as of June 15, 2018 was approximately $12.66, which is lower than the $27.50 per share merger consideration and lower than the $22.62 closing price of Company
Common Stock on the Undisturbed Date.

        The Special Committee and the board of directors considered each of the financial analyses presented by PJS (as summarized under "Special Factors—Opinion of PJS"
beginning on page 56) together as a whole and did not assign relative importance or weight to any specific analysis by PJS or consider any such analysis in isolation from the
other analyses. Thus, the fact that the $27.50 per share merger consideration was below the ranges of values per share of Company Common Stock indicated by two of the
selected companies analyses presented by PJS and the fact that the $27.50 per share merger consideration was within the range of values of all of the other analyses presented by
PJS were facts that were considered only as part of the consideration of all of the analyses presented by PJS, as well as the opinion of PJS, which was similarly presented as being
based upon all of the analyses taken as a whole, that, as of June 15, 2018 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $27.50 in cash per share
of Company Common Stock to be paid to the shareholders (other than Parent and its affiliates), including the Company's "unaffiliated security holders" (as defined in Rule 13e-3
under the Exchange Act), pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such shareholders.

        The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Special Committee and the board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather includes the principal
factors considered by the Special Committee and the board of directors. The Special Committee reached the conclusion to unanimously recommend that the board of directors
approve, and thereafter the board of directors reached the conclusion to unanimously approve, the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement in light of the various factors described above and

other factors that the members of the Special Committee and board of directors believed were appropriate. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the Special
Committee and board of directors in connection with their evaluation of the proposed merger and the complexity of these matters, the Special Committee and board of directors
did not consider it practical, and did not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors they considered in reaching their decision and did
not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate
determination of the Special Committee and the board of directors. Rather, the Special Committee made its recommendation, and the board of directors made its decision to
approve, based on the totality of information that they reviewed and the investigation that they conducted. In considering the factors discussed above, individual members of the
Special Committee and the individual members of the board of directors may have given different weights to different factors. In light of the procedural protections described
above, and given the independent directors' majority status and the engagement of PJS, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Akerman LLP by the Special
Committee, the Special Committee and the board of directors did not consider it necessary to make any provision to grant unaffiliated shareholders access to the Company's
corporate files or to obtain counsel or appraisal services for unaffiliated shareholders.

        In connection with the consummation of the merger, certain of the Company's directors may receive benefits and compensation that may differ from the per share merger
consideration you would receive. See "Special Factors—Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 83.

        Based upon the foregoing, the Company believes that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, are fair to, and in
the best interests of, the Company's unaffiliated shareholders.

        Our Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders of the Company vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement.

Opinion of PJS 

        PJS delivered its opinion to the Special Committee that, as of June 15, 2018 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $27.50 in cash
per share of Company Common Stock to be paid to the shareholders (other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view
to such shareholders.

        The full text of the written opinion of PJS, dated June 15, 2018, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Appendix B. PJS provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the Special Committee in connection with its
consideration of the merger. The PJS opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company as to how any such shareholder should vote on the merger
or act on any matter relating to the merger.

        For purposes of its opinion, PJS:

• reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other information of the Company; 

• reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company prepared and provided to PJS by the management of
the Company and approved for PJS's use by the Company; 

• reviewed certain financial projections for the Company prepared and provided to PJS by the management of the Company and approved for PJS's use by the
Company (the "Projections");

• discussed the past and current operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company with management of the Company; 

• reviewed the reported prices and trading activity of the Company Common Stock; 

• compared the financial performance and condition of the Company and the reported prices and trading activity of the Company Common Stock with that of
certain other publicly traded companies that PJS deemed relevant; 

• reviewed publicly available information regarding the financial terms of certain transactions that PJS deemed relevant, in whole or in part, to the merger; 

• participated in certain discussions among management and other representatives of each of Parent and the Company; 

• reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated June 15, 2018; and 

• performed such other analyses and reviewed such other material and information as PJS deemed appropriate.

        PJS assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the information reviewed by PJS for the purposes of its opinion and PJS did not assume any responsibility
for independent verification of such information and relied on such information being complete and correct. PJS relied on assurances of the management of the Company that
they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading in any respect material to PJS's opinion. With respect to the
Projections, PJS assumed that the Projections were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the future financial
performance of the Company. PJS did not conduct a physical inspection of the facilities or property of the Company. PJS did not assume any responsibility for or perform any
independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor was PJS furnished with any such valuation or appraisal. Furthermore, PJS did not consider any
tax, accounting or legal effects of the merger or transaction structure on any person or entity.

        PJS assumed that the final form of the merger agreement will be substantially the same as the last draft reviewed by PJS and will not vary in any respect material to PJS's
analysis. PJS also assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any
material term, condition or agreement (including, without limitation, the per share merger consideration to be paid to the shareholders of the Company (other than Parent and its
affiliates) in the merger) and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction
or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits of the merger. PJS further assumed that all representations and
warranties set forth in the merger agreement were and will be true and correct as of all the dates made or deemed made and that all parties to the merger agreement will comply
with all covenants of such parties thereunder.

        PJS's opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to PJS as of, June 14, 2018. In particular,
PJS does not express any opinion as to the prices at which the Company Common Stock may trade at any future time or as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or
viability of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or the ability of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Furthermore, PJS's
opinion does not address the Company's underlying business decision to undertake the merger, and the opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to
any alternative transactions or business strategies that might be available to the Company. PJS's opinion does not address any other aspect or implication of the merger or any
other agreement, arrangement

the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the merger, or any
class of such persons, relative to the per share merger consideration to be paid to the shareholders (other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement. The
issuance by PJS of its opinion was authorized by PJS's fairness opinion committee.

        The following summarizes the significant financial analyses performed by PJS and provided to, and reviewed with, the Special Committee in connection with the delivery of
PJS's opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand PJS's financial analyses, the tables must be
read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of PJS's financial analyses. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by PJS, nor does the order
of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by PJS. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that
it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before June 14, 2018, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

Historical Company Share Trading Analysis

        PJS reviewed the historical trading prices and volumes for the Company Common Stock for the 52-week period ending June 14, 2018. In addition, PJS analyzed the per
share merger consideration to be paid to shareholders of the Company pursuant to the merger agreement in relation to, among other things, (i) the closing price per share of
Company Common Stock on the Undisturbed Date, the last trading day before the announcement by George Feldenkreis of a proposal to acquire the Company, (ii) the volume
weighted average price per share of Company Common Stock for the 90-day period ending on the Undisturbed Date, (iii) the volume weighted average price per share of
Company Common Stock for the 60-day period ending on the Undisturbed Date, (iv) the volume weighted average price per share of Company Common Stock for the 30-day
period ending on the Undisturbed Date, (v) the highest closing price per share of Company Common Stock for the 52-week period ending on the Undisturbed Date, and (vi) the
highest closing price per share of Company Common Stock for the 5-year period ending on the Undisturbed Date.

        This analysis indicated that the per share merger consideration of $27.50 to be paid to shareholders of the Company pursuant to the merger agreement represented:

• a premium of 21.6% based on the closing price per share of Company Common Stock, as of the Undisturbed Date, of $22.62; 

• a premium of 14.0% based on the volume weighted average price per share of Company Common Stock for the 90-day period ending on the Undisturbed Date, of
$24.13; 

• a premium of 11.1% based on the volume weighted average price per share of Company Common Stock for the 60-day period ending on the Undisturbed Date, of
$24.75; 

• a premium of 9.4% based on the volume weighted average price per share of Company Common Stock for the 30-day period ending on the Undisturbed Date, of
$25.14; 

• a premium of 5.8% based on the highest closing price per share of Company Common Stock for the 52-week period ending on the Undisturbed Date, of $25.99;
and 

• a discount of 4.5% based on the highest closing price per share of Company Common Stock for the 5-year period ending on the Undisturbed Date, of $28.80.

Equity Research Analyst Price Targets

        PJS reviewed selected public market trading price targets for the Company Common Stock prepared and published by four Wall Street research analysts that published or
confirmed price targets as of June 14, 2018. PJS reviewed the most recent 12-month price target published by each analyst as of such date. These targets reflect each analyst's
estimate of the public market trading price of the Company Common Stock within 12 months from the time the price target was published. As of June 14, 2018, the range of
selected equity analyst price targets for the Company Common Stock was from $27.50 to $29.00 per share of Company Common Stock.

        The public market trading price targets published by securities research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for the Company Common Stock,
and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of the Company and future financial market conditions.

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis

        PJS reviewed and compared certain financial information for the Company to corresponding financial information for the following publicly traded corporations in the
apparel industry (collectively, the "selected companies"):

• PVH Corp.; 

• Hanesbrands; 

• Ralph Lauren Corporation; 

• G-III Apparel Group; 

• Oxford Industries; and 

• Delta Apparel.

        Perry Ellis participates in the design, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel and accessories. The Company is one of the largest apparel
companies in the world with a portfolio consisting of nationally and internationally recognized lifestyle brand names. Although none of the selected companies is directly
comparable to the Company, the companies included were chosen because they are U.S. domestic, publicly traded companies which engage in a similar business as the Company
and with operations that, for purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain operations of the Company. When compiling the selected companies, PJS excluded
companies which were primarily focused on accessories (e.g., Tapestry and Michael Kors) or active and outdoor apparel (e.g., VF, Under Armour and Columbia Sportswear
Company), as well as companies that recognize the majority of their revenues through direct sales at company owned retail locations (e.g., Guess?).

        PJS also calculated and compared various financial multiples for the selected companies and the Company based on historical financial data from publicly available sources,
forecasts from Wall Street research available as of June 14, 2018 for the selected companies, and the Projections.

        With respect to the selected companies and the Company, PJS calculated:

• the enterprise value (which represents the equity value plus book values of total debt, including preferred stock and minority interest, less cash) ("EV") as a
multiple of latest twelve months ("LTM") adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA"); 

• EV as a multiple of Adjusted EBITDA for calendar year 2018;

        PJS then used an illustrative range of multiples to calculate a range of implied values for the Company Common Stock based on the Projections, as summarized below. The
ranges of multiples used by PJS were chosen by PJS utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account PJS's review of the multiples of the selected
companies.

PJS believed in its judgement to be representative of the current market environment (collectively, the "selected transactions"):

        Although none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the merger, the target companies in the selected transactions were North America-based companies in
the branded apparel industry that were acquired since December 2013 and therefore had operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of the
Company's operations and product candidate profile, and as such, for purposes of analysis, the selected transactions may be considered similar to the merger. PJS did not make
any determinations to exclude any transactions that met the criteria described above.

        For each of the selected transactions, PJS calculated and compared the enterprise value implied by the transaction as a multiple of the LTM Adjusted EBITDA of the target.

        PJS performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the Company using the Projections. The specific Projections that were used were the March 2018
Management Projections (as defined in "Special Factors—Projected Financial Information" beginning on page 74). Using discount rates ranging from 10.1% to 13.1%, reflecting
estimates of the Company's weighted average cost of capital (derived by the application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which requires certain Company-specific inputs,
including the Company's target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate
and a beta for the company, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally), PJS discounted to present value as of June 14, 2018,
(i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for the Company through year-end 2021 as reflected in the Projections, and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for the Company,
which were calculated by applying an illustrative range of exit terminal year EBITDA multiples of 9.0x to 11.0x (which range was selected by PJS using its judgment after taking
into account the EBITDA multiples included in the Selected Publicly Traded Companies (EV / LTM EBITDA multiple range of 10.0x to 12.5x) and Selected Precedent
Transactions analyses (EV / LTM EBITDA multiple range of 6.2x to 11.0x)) to projected terminal year EBITDA for the Company as reflected in the Projections (which analysis
implied perpetuity growth rates (as a result of the application of such EBITDA multiple range to the terminal year EBITDA) ranging from 4.50% to 8.40% for the terminal year
estimate of the free cash flow to be generated by the Company per the Projections). PJS then added the ranges of present values it derived above to derive a range of illustrative
EVs for the Company. PJS then subtracted the amount of the Company's adjusted net debt, as provided by the management of the Company, from the range of illustrative EVs it
derived for the Company to derive a range of illustrative equity values for the Company. PJS then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully
diluted shares of Company Common Stock, as provided by the management of the Company, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of Company Common
Stock of $23.88 to $32.99.

Illustrative Present Value of Future Company Share Price Analysis

        PJS performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present values per share of Company Common Stock, as of June 14, 2018, based on theoretical future values of the
Company Common Stock, as of June 14, 2018 and as of the first day of each fiscal year from 2019 through 2021, derived by PJS based on the Projections.

        Using the Projections, PJS derived a range of theoretical values per share of Company Common Stock as of June 14, 2018 and as of the first day of each fiscal year from
2019 through 2021 by applying, with respect to each such date, illustrative one year forward price to earnings per share of Company Common Stock multiples ranging from
10.8x to 18.1x to the estimate of the earnings per share of Company Common Stock for the current year, as reflected in the Projections, to derive ranges of implied equity values
per share of Company Common Stock as of such dates. As noted above, PJS

assumed that the Projections were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the future financial performance of the
Company.

        By applying a discount rate of 12.8%, reflecting an estimate of the Company's cost of equity, PJS discounted to present value, as of June 14, 2018, the ranges of theoretical
values of the Company Common Stock, as of June 14, 2018 and as of the first day of each fiscal year from 2019 through 2021. This analysis resulted in a range of implied
present values of $21.60 to $35.06 per share of Company Common Stock.

Premia Analysis

        PJS reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia for all-cash acquisition transactions announced during the time period from June 14,
2013 through June 14, 2018 involving a public company based in the United States (excluding the biotechnology, brokerage, finance, insurance, pharmaceutical and real estate
industries) as the target where both (x) the disclosed enterprise values for the transaction were between $400 million and $600 million and (y) at least a 50% stake was acquired.
This analysis excluded transactions where the total consideration was below $1.00 per share. For the entire period, using publicly available information, PJS calculated the
median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile premiums of the price paid in the five-year period ending June 14, 2018 and the three-year period ending June 14, 2018, relative to
the target's last undisturbed closing stock price prior to announcement of the transaction. This analysis indicated a median premium of 28.0% across the five-year period and
28.0% across the three-year period, respectively. This analysis also indicated a 25th percentile premium of 18.1% across the five-year period and 17.7% across the three-year
period, respectively, and a 75th percentile premium of 42.6% across the five-year period and 34.4% across the three-year period, respectively. Using this analysis, PJS applied a
reference range of illustrative premiums of 17.7% to 42.6% to the closing price per share of Company Common Stock of $22.62 as of the Undisturbed Date and calculated a
range of implied equity values per share of Company Common Stock of $26.62 to $32.87.

* In the case of a transaction where there were media reports of the transaction in advance of the announcement of the definitive agreement, the premium
is measured based on the undisturbed price, which is the last closing price before such media reports. "One-Day Premium" therefore means either the
one-day premium (where there were no media reports media reports of the transaction in advance of the announcement of the definitive agreement) or
the premium to the undisturbed price (where there were such media reports). Thus, this analysis analyses premia relative to the closing price on the last
trading day before the announcement of a transaction (when there were no earlier media reports of the transaction) and premia relative to the
undisturbed price (where there have been such earlier media reports) as part of the same, combined premia analysis and compares the results of this
analysis to the premium represented by the merger, which is measured against the undisturbed price since there were media reports of the merger in
advance of the announcement of the definitive merger agreement.

Miscellaneous

        In arriving at PJS's opinion, PJS performed a variety of financial analyses, the material portions of which are summarized above. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without
considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying PJS's opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, PJS considered the
results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, PJS made its determination as to fairness on the basis of
its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly
comparable to the Company or the merger.

        PJS prepared these analyses for purposes of PJS's providing its opinion to the Special Committee as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the shareholders of the
Company (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the $27.50 in cash per share of Company Common Stock to be paid to such shareholders of the Company pursuant to the merger
agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon
forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these
analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the Company,
Parent, PJS or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.

        The $27.50 in cash per share of Company Common Stock was determined through arm's-length negotiations between the Special Committee and Parent and was approved
by the board of directors. PJS provided advice to the Special Committee during these negotiations. PJS did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to the
Special Committee, the Company or the board of directors or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.

        As described above, PJS's opinion to the Special Committee was one of many factors taken into consideration by the board of directors in making its determination to
approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by PJS in connection with the fairness opinion
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of PJS attached as Appendix B.

        Natixis, S.A. ("Natixis"), which became the holder of a majority of PJS's outstanding equity on June 8, 2016, is, together with its affiliates, engaged in advisory,
underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment management, insurance and other financial and non-financial activities and services for
various persons and entities. Natixis and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with
which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default
swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including affiliates of George Feldenkreis, an affiliate of Parent,
or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the merger.

        The Special Committee selected PJS as its financial advisor because it is a recognized financial advisory firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the
merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated February 22, 2018, the Special Committee engaged PJS to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. The engagement
letter between the Special Committee and PJS provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement of the merger
agreement, at approximately $6.6 million to $6.8 million, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the merger and a portion of which was payable upon

the delivery by PJS of its opinion. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse PJS for its expenses and to indemnify PJS against certain liabilities arising out of its
engagement by the Special Committee. PJS has not, during the two years prior to the date of its opinion, provided any financial advisory services to the Company, Parent, George
Feldenkreis or their respective affiliates for which PJS received payment other than fees in connection with the engagement relating to the merger, which fees will be credited
against the aforementioned transaction fee relating to the merger. In the future, PJS, Natixis and their respective affiliates may provide financial advisory services to the
Company, Parent, George Feldenkreis and their respective affiliates, and in the future may receive compensation for rendering these services. Natixis has advised PJS that, in the
past two years, it has not provided any corporate or investment banking services to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, George Feldenkreis or any of their respective affiliates.

Purposes and Reasons of the Company for the Merger 

        The Company's purpose for engaging in the merger is to enable its shareholders to receive $27.50 per share of Company Common Stock, which represents (i) a premium of
21.6%, based on the closing price per share of Company Common Stock on the Undisturbed Date of $22.62; (ii) a premium of 14.0% based on the volume weighted average
price per share of Company Common Stock for the 90-day period ending on the Undisturbed Date of $24.13; (iii) a premium of 11.1% based on the volume weighted average
price per share of Company Common Stock for the 60-day period ending on the Undisturbed Date of $24.75; (iv) a premium of 9.4% based on the volume weighted average
price per share of Company Common Stock for the 30-day period ending on the Undisturbed Date of $25.14; (v) a premium of 5.8% based on the highest closing price per share
of Company Common Stock for the 52-week period ending on the Undisturbed Date of $25.99; and (vi) a discount of 4.5% based on the highest closing price per share of
Company Common Stock for the 5-year period ending on the Undisturbed Date of $28.80. The Company has determined to undertake the merger at this time based on the
conclusions, determinations and reasons of the Special Committee and the board of directors described in detail above under "Special Factors—Background of the Merger"
beginning on page 18 and "Special Factors—Recommendation of the Special Committee and Our Board of Directors; Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger
Agreement; Fairness of the Merger" beginning on page 50.

Purposes and Reasons of the GF Group Filing Persons for the Merger 

        Under the SEC rules governing "going-private" transactions, the GF Group Filing Persons are considered affiliates of the Company and, therefore, are required to express
their purposes and reasons for the merger to the Company's unaffiliated shareholders, as defined in Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act. The GF Group Filing Persons are making
the statements included in this section solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules under the Exchange Act.

        For the GF Group Filing Persons, the purpose of the merger is to enable Parent to acquire control of the Company, in a transaction in which the unaffiliated shareholders of
the Company will be cashed out for $27.50 per share of Company Common Stock, so that the Rollover Investors, through their ownership of Parent, will bear the rewards and
risks of the ownership of the Company after shares of Company Common Stock cease to be publicly traded.

        The GF Group Filing Persons intend that, following completion of the merger, Oscar Feldenkreis will continue to lead the Company as Chief Executive Officer and George
Feldenkreis will return to an active role in the management of the Company. As stated in his proposal letter for the merger, George Feldenkreis decided to pursue the merger
because he believes that the Company would benefit greatly from being a privately-owned company, which would enable the Company to execute a long-term growth strategy.
The GF Group Filing Persons believe that the branded apparel and retail sector is in the midst of unprecedented disruption and competition that necessitate long-term orientation
toward

investment in the Company's brands, technology and people. The GF Group Filing Persons believe that the Company's ability to invest and innovate is constrained under the
current public company paradigm, where the public markets are increasingly focused on short-term results. As a privately-owned company, the Company would have increased
flexibility to make decisions that may negatively affect quarterly results but that may, over the long-term, increase the Company's value. In contrast, as a publicly-traded
company, the Company currently faces public shareholder and investment analyst pressure to make decisions that may produce better short-term results, but which may over the
long-term lead to a reduction in the per share price of its publicly-traded equity securities. As a privately-owned company, the Company would also be relieved of many of the
other significant burdens, constraints and expenses imposed on public companies.

Positions of the GF Group Filing Persons Regarding the Fairness of the Merger 

        Under the SEC rules governing "going-private" transactions, the GF Group Filing Persons are considered affiliates of the Company and, therefore, are required to express
their beliefs as to the fairness of the merger to the unaffiliated shareholders of the Company. The GF Group Filing Persons are making the statements included in this section
solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules under the Exchange Act.

        As described below, the GF Group Filing Persons believe that the merger is fair to the unaffiliated shareholders of the Company on the basis of (i) the factors as described in
"Special Factors—Recommendation of the Special Committee and Our Board of Directors; Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement; Fairness of the
Merger" beginning on page 50, which factors the GF Group Filing Persons agree with and adopt, and (ii) the additional factors described below.

        The GF Group Filing Persons believe that the interests of the Company's unaffiliated shareholders were represented by the Special Committee, which negotiated the terms
and conditions of the merger agreement on behalf of the Company's unaffiliated shareholders with the assistance of its independent legal and financial advisors. None of the GF
Group Filing Persons believes that it has or had any fiduciary duty to the Company or its shareholders, including with respect to the merger and its terms (other than in George
Feldenkreis' capacity as a member of the board of directors of the Company and in Oscar Feldenkreis' capacity as an officer and member of the board of directors of the
Company).

        None of the GF Group Filing Persons participated in the deliberations of the Special Committee regarding, or received advice from the Special Committee's independent
legal or financial advisors as to, the substantive or procedural fairness of the merger. The Rollover Investors have interests in the merger different from those of the unaffiliated
shareholders of the Company by virtue of the Rollover Investors' continuing equity interest in Parent following the merger. The GF Group Filing Persons have not performed, or
engaged a financial advisor to perform, any valuation or other analysis for the purpose of assessing the fairness of the merger to the unaffiliated shareholders of the Company.
George Feldenkreis engaged Scope as a financial advisor in connection with the merger and obtaining and negotiating the financing for the merger. From time to time during the
process described in "Special Factors—Background of the Merger," upon the request of George Feldenkreis, Scope provided its advice, and consulted with, George Feldenkreis
with respect to the potential transaction with the Company. Specifically, as advised by the GF Group Filing Persons, Scope introduced George Feldenkreis to potential financing
sources and assisted him in obtaining financing for the merger (and advised him with respect to potential alternatives to such financing), provided strategic advice with respect to
negotiating the terms of the merger and related financing with the Special Committee and such financing sources, advised on specific deal terms set forth in the various drafts of
the merger agreement and debt commitment letters, and acted as a liaison for George Feldenkreis to the Special Committee's financial advisor. However, as advised by the GF
Group Filing Persons, George Feldenkreis did not receive any report, opinion or appraisal from Scope or another outside party materially related to the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, including any report,

opinion or appraisal relating to the merger consideration or the fairness of the merger consideration to the unaffiliated shareholders of the Company or the GF Group Filing
Persons.

        Based on the GF Group Filing Persons' knowledge and analysis of available information regarding the Company, as well as discussions with members of the Company's
senior management regarding the Company and its business and the factors considered by, and findings of, the board of directors and the Special Committee described in
"Special Factors—Recommendation of the Special Committee and Our Board of Directors; Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement; Fairness of the
Merger" beginning on page 50 (which findings the GF Group Filing Persons agree with and adopt), the GF Group Filing Persons believe that the merger is substantively fair to
the unaffiliated shareholders of the Company. In particular, the GF Group Filing Persons considered the following:

• the board of directors determined, after careful consideration and acknowledging the interest of George Feldenkreis and Oscar Feldenkreis in the merger, by the
unanimous vote of all members of the board of directors, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, that the merger is fair to, and
in the best interests of, the Company and its unaffiliated shareholders; 

• the per share merger consideration of $27.50 represents a premium of approximately 21.6% to the unaffected closing price of the Company Common Stock on
February 5, 2018, the last trading day prior to George Feldenkreis publicly announcing his proposal to take the Company private; 

• the fact that the consideration to be paid in the merger is all cash, providing the unaffiliated shareholders of the Company with certainty of value and liquidity for
their shares of Company Common Stock, eliminating any uncertainty in valuing the consideration to be received by such shareholders and allowing such
shareholders to avoid exposure to the risks and uncertainties relating to the prospects of the Company; and 

• the fact that there are no unusual requirements or conditions to the merger, and the fact that Parent received debt commitment letters which, together with the
Rollover Investors' obligation to rollover all of their existing holdings of Company Common Stock into Parent, provide the financing necessary to consummate
the merger, each increasing the likelihood that the merger will be consummated and that the consideration to be paid to the unaffiliated shareholders of the
Company in the merger will be received.

        The GF Group Filing Persons did not consider liquidation value as a factor because they consider the Company to be a viable going concern business and the trading history
of the Company Common Stock to generally be an indication of its value as such. In addition, due to the fact that the Company is being sold as a going concern, the GF Group
Filing Persons did not consider the liquidation value of the Company relevant to a determination as to whether the merger is fair to the Company's unaffiliated shareholders as the
GF Group Filing Persons believed the value of the Company's assets that might be realized in a liquidation would be significantly less than its going concern value. Further, the
GF Group Filing Persons did not consider net book value a material indicator of the value of the Company because they believed that net book value, which is an accounting
concept, reflects historical costs and not the value of the Company as a going concern. The GF Group Filing Persons calculated the Company's net book value per diluted share at
$24.96 as of May 5, 2018, which is significantly below the per share merger consideration.

        The GF Group Filing Persons believe that the merger is procedurally fair to the unaffiliated shareholders of the Company based upon the following:

• other than their receipt of board and Special Committee fees (which are not contingent upon the consummation of the merger or the Special Committee's or the
board of directors' recommendation or approval of the merger) and their interests described in "Special Factors—Interests of the Company's Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on

page 83, no member of the Special Committee has a financial interest in the merger that is different from, or in addition to, the interests of the unaffiliated
shareholders generally, although the merger agreement does include customary provisions for indemnity and the continuation of liability insurance for the
Company's officers and directors and the acceleration of certain equity awards;

• the interests of the Company's unaffiliated shareholders were represented by the Special Committee, consisting solely of directors who are not officers or
employees of the Company and who are not affiliated with the GF Group Filing Persons, and the Special Committee was given exclusive authority to, among
other things, review, evaluate and negotiate the terms of the merger, to decide not to engage in the merger and to consider alternatives to the merger; 

• the Special Committee retained its own independent legal and financial advisors; 

• the Special Committee was deliberate in its process, taking over four months to analyze and evaluate George Feldenkreis' proposal and to negotiate extensively
the terms of the merger agreement; 

• the Special Committee received a written opinion, dated June 15, 2018, from PJS, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of such
opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, of the $27.50 in cash per share to be paid to the shareholders (other than
Parent and its affiliates), including the Company's "unaffiliated security holders" (as defined in Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act), pursuant to the merger
agreement; 

• the merger was approved by the unanimous vote of the board of directors, after careful consideration and acknowledging the interest of George Feldenkreis and
Oscar Feldenkreis in the merger, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee; 

• the merger is subject to a condition requiring the adoption of the merger agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company
Common Stock that are not owned by (i) officers or directors of the Company, (ii) the Rollover Investors or (iii) any person having any equity interest in Parent or
Merger Sub, and the Company has the ability to terminate the merger agreement if such approval is not obtained; 

• the Special Committee has the ability to (i) respond to unsolicited takeover proposals and (ii) terminate the merger agreement for a superior proposal prior to
adoption of the merger agreement by the Company's shareholders, in each case, subject to certain conditions in the merger agreement, including in the case of a
termination of the merger agreement, the payment of a termination fee of $8.736 million by the Company; and 

• the fact that appraisal rights are available to unaffiliated shareholders who comply with all of the required procedures under the FBCA for exercising appraisal
rights, which allows such holders to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares in lieu of receiving the per share merger consideration.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the GF Group Filing Persons in connection with the fairness of the merger
agreement and the merger is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all material factors considered by them. The GF Group Filing Persons did not find it
practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attach relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching their position as to the fairness of the merger agreement and the
merger. Rather, the GF Group Filing Persons made the fairness determinations after considering all of the foregoing as a whole. The GF Group Filing Persons believe these
factors provide a reasonable basis upon which to form their belief that the merger is fair to the unaffiliated shareholders of the Company. This belief should not, however, be
construed as a recommendation to any Company shareholder to approve the merger or adopt the merger agreement. The GF Group Filing Persons do not make any
recommendation as to how shareholders of the Company should vote

their shares of Company Common Stock relating to the merger (other than in each of George Feldenkreis' and Oscar Feldenkreis' capacity as a member of the board of directors
of the Company).

Certain Effects of the Merger; Plans for the Company 

        If the merger is completed, all of the equity interests in the Company will be owned by Parent. No current Company shareholder (other than the Rollover Investors) will
have any ownership interest in, or be a shareholder of, the Company. As a result, the Company's shareholders (other than the Rollover Investors) will no longer benefit from any
increases in the Company's value, nor will they bear the risk of any decreases in the Company's value. Following the merger, Parent (and the Rollover Investors through their
ownership of Parent) will benefit from any increases in the value of the Company and also will bear the risk of any decreases in the value of the Company.

        If the merger is completed, each share of Company Common Stock owned immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, other than as provided below, will be
converted into the right to receive $27.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. The following shares of Company Common Stock will not be
converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration in connection with the merger: (i) shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its
wholly-owned subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries, (ii) shares of Company Common Stock held by the Rollover Investors, and (iii) shares of Company Common Stock
whose holders have not voted in favor of adopting the merger agreement and have demanded and perfected their appraisal rights in accordance with, and have complied in all
respects with, the FBCA.

        In connection with the consummation of the merger, (i) each stock option and stock appreciation right, whether or not then exercisable or vested, will be converted into the
right to receive at the closing cash equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price of the applicable option or stock
appreciation right and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such option or stock appreciation right; (ii) each restricted stock award not subject to any
performance-based vesting condition held by an employee will be automatically vested and converted into the right to receive at the closing cash equal to the product of (a) the
per share merger consideration and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award; (iii) each restricted stock award not subject to
any performance-based vesting condition held by a non-employee member of the board of directors will vest on a prorated basis based on the number of days that have elapsed
since the grant date of such award and be converted into the right to receive at the closing cash equal to the product of (a) the per share merger consideration and (b) such pro-
rated number of shares; and (iv) with the exception of certain management members described below, each restricted stock award subject to any performance-based vesting
condition will be converted into a right to receive a restricted cash award from the surviving corporation that will vest and be payable (without regard to any performance goals
but subject to applicable service vesting conditions in the prior award) at the end of its currently applicable vesting period, with the cash payment therefor equal to the product of:
(a) the per share merger consideration and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award that would have vested based on target
level achievement. Such restricted cash award will accelerate upon a termination without cause or for good reason prior to the scheduled vesting date. Each restricted stock award
subject to any performance-based vesting condition held by Mr. Jorge Narino or Ms. Tricia McDermott Thompkins will be converted into a right to receive at the closing a cash
payment equal to the product of: (a) the per share merger consideration and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award that
would have vested based on target level achievement. All outstanding restricted stock units held by George Feldenkreis will be cancelled. If the merger is completed, the
Company Common Stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market (and no longer publicly traded) and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and the Company will no
longer file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to the Company Common Stock.

        Parent expects that following completion of the merger, our operations will be conducted substantially as they are currently being conducted. However, following
completion of the merger, the Company will have significantly more debt than it currently has. There are no current plans to repay the debt incurred in connection with the
merger, and there are restrictions on the repayment of such debt as described under "Special Factors—Financing of the Merger" beginning on page 78. Parent has evaluated and
reviewed the Company's business and operations, including exploring the possibility of pursuing future acquisitions, new license opportunities and an organic growth strategy.
However, Parent has no current plans, proposals or negotiations which relate to or would result in an extraordinary corporate transaction involving the Company's corporate
structure, business or management, such as a merger, reorganization, liquidation, relocation of any operations, or sale or transfer of a material amount of assets, or the incurrence
of any indebtedness, in each case except as described in this Proxy Statement, including under "Special Factors—Purposes and Reasons of the GF Group Filing Persons for the
Merger" beginning on page 66.

Alternatives to the Merger 

        As noted above, in response to the indication of interest from George Feldenkreis, the Special Committee evaluated potential strategic alternatives, including a potential sale
of the Company, with the assistance of the Company's senior management and advisors. The indication of interest by George Feldenkreis had been made independently and not in
response to any process initiated by the Special Committee, the board of directors or the Company to sell the Company. As noted above, while the Special Committee was
responding to the indications of interest for, and the inquiries about, the sale of the Company that the Company received from George Feldenkreis and other potential acquirors
during the course of 2018, the Special Committee also considered the potential benefits to the Company (and the Company's shareholders) of certain strategic alternatives,
including, but not limited to, continuing as a stand-alone company, effecting a leveraged recapitalization and/or pursuing other potential mergers and acquisitions and other
potential strategic transactions. In considering those alternatives, the Special Committee took into account all information that was available to the Special Committee, including
the information contained in management's projections summarized under "Special Factors—

Projected Financial Information" beginning on page 74, as well as the Special Committee's knowledge and understanding of the business, operations, management, financial
condition, earnings and prospects of the Company, including the prospects of the Company as a stand-alone company. For more information on the process behind the Special
Committee's determination, see "Special Factors—Background of the Merger" beginning on page 18, "Special Factors—Recommendation of the Special Committee and Our
Board of Directors; Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement; Fairness of the Merger" beginning on page 50 and "Special Factors—Purpose and
Reasons of the Company for the Merger" beginning on page 66. As discussed above under "Special Factors—Background of the Merger" beginning on page 18, while the
Company had received, prior to the date of the merger agreement, certain expressions of interest for, and certain inquiries about, the sale of the Company to a potential acquiror
(including from George Feldenkreis and Randa), George Feldenkreis has made the only firm offer to acquire the Company that the Company had ever received during the past
two years.

Effects on the Company if the Merger is not Completed 

        If the Company's shareholders do not adopt the merger agreement or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, the Company's shareholders will not receive any
payment for their shares of Company Common Stock unless the Company is sold to a third party. Instead, unless the Company is sold to a third party, we will remain a public
company, Company Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Market, and our shareholders will continue to be subject to similar risks and
opportunities as they currently are with respect to their ownership of Company Common Stock. If the merger is not completed, there is no assurance as to the effect of these risks
and opportunities on the future value of your shares of Company Common Stock, including the risk that the market price of Company Common Stock may decline to the extent
that the current market price of Company Common Stock reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. From time to time, the board of directors will evaluate
and review the business operations, properties, dividend policy and capitalization of the Company and, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and
continue to seek to maximize shareholder value. If the Company's shareholders do not adopt the merger agreement or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, there is
no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Company will be offered or that the business, prospects or results of operations of the Company will not be adversely
impacted, including as a result of the significant costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the merger. Pursuant to the merger agreement, under certain
circumstances, the Company is permitted to terminate the merger agreement and recommend an alternative transaction. See "The Merger Agreement—Termination" beginning on
page 137.

        Under certain circumstances, if the merger is not completed, the Company may be obligated to pay to Parent a termination fee. See "The Merger Agreement—Effect of
Termination; Fees and Expenses" beginning on page 139.

Projected Financial Information 

        The Company provided the GF Group certain prospective financial information concerning the Company, including projected revenues, gross margins, net income and
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"). The GF Group also received other financial information related to its due diligence of the Company.
The GF Group also had access to publicly available analysts' projections for years subsequent to 2019. The GF Group received the following prospective financial information:

• the Company's budget for the 2019 fiscal year (the "January 2018 Budget for FY 2019"), which was the product of the Company's routine annual planning process
for fiscal year 2019 and was substantially completed in late 2017 and approved by the board of directors in January 2018;

• March 2018 unadjusted Company management projections (the "FY2019E Budget"), which were projections for fiscal years 2019 - 2021 prepared by the
Company's management for the board of directors meeting in March 2018, but which the board of directors did not approve or utilize for bonus or any other
purpose because the projections for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 did not reflect the decline in sales related to the bankruptcy of Bon-Ton; and 

• March 2018 adjusted Company management projections (the "March 2018 Management Projections"), which were projections for the fiscal years 2019 - 2021
prepared by the Company's management for the board of directors meeting in March 2018, which reflected the decline in sales related to the bankruptcy of Bon-
Ton.

        The March 2018 Management Projections are the projections used by PJS in connection with its fairness analysis as described in "Special Factors—Opinion of PJS"
beginning on page 56. The summary of the prospective financial information set forth below is included solely to give shareholders access to the information that was made
available to the GF Group and the Special Committee's financial advisor, and reviewed by the Special Committee and board of directors. It is not included in this Proxy
Statement in order to influence any shareholder to make any investment decision with respect to the merger or any other purpose, including whether or not to seek appraisal
rights with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock.

        The prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, or with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC, the
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts, or U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP"). Neither the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any
procedures with respect to the prospective financial information included below, or expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.
The January 2018 Budget for FY 2019 was prepared as part of the Company's annual planning process for fiscal year 2019. The FY2019E Budget was prepared by management
as a routine part of the Compensation Committee's equity award approval process but did not make risk-adjustments to reflect the decline in sales related to the bankruptcy of
Bon-Ton. The March 2018 Management Projections were prepared by the Company's management at the direction of the Compensation Committee to reflect such risk-
adjustments.

        The prospective financial information is based on input from brand and functional leaders, each of whom provide guidance as to revenues and expenses on specific
divisions, brands and/or channels. Based on feedback from these individuals, as well as review and revisions by the CEO, CFO and Senior Vice President of Finance, the
prospective financial information was developed on an annual basis by brand, by product category (e.g., apparel vs. accessories), with consideration given to wholesale,
DTC (direct-to-consumer), and inbound / outbound licenses.

        The process by which management created the prospective financial information reflect numerous qualitative estimates and assumptions. Among others, these assumptions
include management's confidence in the Company's business and outlook, management's ability to extrapolate future performance of brands and segments from information at
hand, and management's capability of foreseeing micro-economic and macro-economic factors across the Company's divisions, brands and channels.

        In its qualitative analysis and aggregation of various inputs, management applied several limiting factors to the assumptions that underlie the prospective financial
information. For example, management's view of the Company's business and outlook was restrained by the risks and opportunities faced by each brand and segment in the
current distribution channels, recent performance and competitive environment. Similarly, management's extrapolation of future performance of brands and segments was
tempered with the demands of the Company's long-term strategy. Finally,

management's capability to foresee micro-economic and macro-economic factors was put in context by recent and anticipated bankruptcies and credit risk amongst broadline
customers, such as Bon-Ton.

        The prospective financial information constitutes forward-looking information and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from the results forecasted in such prospective information, including, but not limited to, the Company's performance, industry performance, general business, economic,
regulatory, market and financial conditions, and the various risks set forth in this Proxy Statement and the Company's reports filed with the SEC, which are available without
charge at www.sec.gov (see also "Where Shareholders Can Find More Information" beginning on page 160). Such prospective information cannot, therefore, be considered a
guaranty of future operating results, and there can be no assurance that the prospective financial information will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher
or lower than as set forth in the prospective financial information.

        The prospective financial information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date it was prepared, including the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. Further, the prospective financial information does not take into account the effect of any failure of the merger to occur and should not be
viewed as accurate or continuing in that context.

        The inclusion of the prospective financial information herein should not be deemed an admission or representation by the Company, the GF Group, the Special Committee
or the board of directors that it is viewed by the Company, the GF Group, the Special Committee or the board of directors as material information of the Company, and in fact the
Company, the GF Group, the Special Committee and the board of directors view the prospective financial information as non-material because of the inherent risks and
uncertainties associated with such long-range forecasts. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the Company, the GF Group, any of their
respective financial advisors or anyone who received this information then considered, or now considers, it as necessarily predictive of actual or future events, and this
information should not be relied upon as such. None of the Company, the GF Group or any of their affiliates or representatives intends to, and each of them disclaims any
obligation to, update, revise or correct the prospective financial information if any of it is or becomes inaccurate (even in the short term). The prospective financial information
should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information regarding the Company contained herein and in the Company's public
filings with the SEC, which are available without charge at www.sec.gov (see also "Where Shareholders Can Find More Information" beginning on page 160). Shareholders
should be aware that the January 2018 Budget for FY 2019 and FY2019E Budget (collectively, the "Other Projections") were both prepared for purposes that are different from
the March 2018 Management Projections provided to the Special Committee's financial advisor and, as a result, may not utilize the same assumptions. Shareholders should also
be aware that the Special Committee engaged an independent third-party consultant, AlixPartners, to review the March 2018 Management Projections and the Other Projections
and the Special Committee believes after considering, among other things, the oral briefing and written findings of AlixPartners that the March 2018 Management Projections,
based on the interviews, documents and data analyzed by AlixPartners (the truth, accuracy, or completeness of which were not independently verified by AlixPartners), were
reasonably prepared and reflected the best estimates available at that time of the Company's management of the Company's future financial performance and that PJS should
utilize the March 2018 Management Projections for its financial analysis. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Company's prospective financial
information, shareholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the prospective financial information included in this Proxy Statement.

January 2018 Budget for FY 2019

        The January 2018 Budget for FY 2019 was a product of the Company's annual planning process for 2018 and was approved by the board of directors.

        The following is a summary of the fiscal year 2019 prospective financial information from the January 2018 Budget for FY 2019 provided to the GF Group and the Special
Committee's financial advisor ($ in millions):

        In March 2018, as part of the Compensation Committee's annual equity award approvals, management of the Company prepared the FY2019E Budget, which was reviewed
by the Special Committee and board of directors and provided to the Special Committee's financial advisor. None of the Compensation Committee, the Special Committee or the
board of directors approved these projections as they did not reflect appropriate risk adjustments for the contraction in the retail customer base, including the bankruptcy filing of
Bon-Ton.

March 2018 Management Projections

        In March 2018, management of the Company prepared the March 2018 Management Projections, which adjusted the FY2019E Budget to reflect the contraction in the retail
customer base, including the bankruptcy filing of Bon-Ton. The March 2018 Management Projections were reviewed by the Special Committee and board of directors and
provided to the Special Committee's financial advisor. The Special Committee, after considering the findings of AlixPartners, determined the March 2018 Management
Projections to be in the range of reasonableness. On April 6, 2018 the board of directors approved the March 2018 Management Projections. The Special Committee directed its
financial advisor to utilize the March 2018 Management Projections in its valuation and fairness analysis.

        The following is a summary of the March 2018 Management Projections provided to the GF Group and the Special Committee's financial advisor ($ in millions):

        The Company routinely asks its brand and divisional managers to establish full-year sales goals and to provide quarterly updates of those goals. Such goals are then "rolled
up" each quarter and used by management to internally incentivize sales and are presented to the board of directors in connection with its quarterly meetings for informational
purposes only. Such sales goals do not reflect management's view of future performance of the Company and the Special Committee determined, after considering the findings of
AlixPartners, that any such sales goals should be disregarded by the Special Committee for valuation purposes.

Financing of the Merger 

        The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger under the merger agreement are not subject to a condition of Parent or Merger Sub obtaining funds to
consummate the merger. Parent and Merger Sub have obtained debt financing commitments for the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the aggregate proceeds of
which, including the Rollover Investment described below and cash on hand at the closing, are expected to be sufficient, assuming such financing commitments are funded in
accordance with their terms, to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the payment by Parent of the per share
merger consideration and all related fees and expenses, and to refinance (the "Refinancing") certain indebtedness of the Company, including indebtedness under (i) the Amended
and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of December 2, 2011, by and among the Company, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Bank of America, N.A., the
lenders from time to time party thereto, and the other borrowers and guarantors party thereto, as amended from time to time and (ii) (A) that certain Amended and Restated
Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents and Security Agreement, Notice of Future Advance and Extension Agreement, dated as of November 22, 2016, by Supreme

Debt Financing

        On June 15, 2018, the Parent received a (i) debt commitment letter from Fortress providing Parent with $282 million of credit facilities (the "Fortress Facilities") consisting
of a (x) $140 million first lien credit facility ("First Lien Facility"), (y) $95 million second lien credit facility ("Second Lien Facility") and (z) $47 million real estate bridge loan
facility ("Bridge Loan Facility") and (ii) debt commitment letter from Wells Fargo (such debt commitment letter, the "Wells Commitment Letter" and together with the Fortress
Commitment Letter, the "Debt Commitment Letters") providing Parent with a $275 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Wells Facility" and together with the
Fortress Facilities, the "Facilities"). On June 30, 2018, the Wells Commitment Letter was amended and restated to add PNC Capital Markets LLC as a joint lead arranger and
PNC Bank, N.A. as an initial lender ("PNC").

        The Debt Commitment Letters contemplate a reorganization of the Company into (i) an operating company which will be financed by Wells Fargo and PNC ("OpCo") and
(ii)(x) an entity holding the intellectual property assets of the Company ("IPCo") which will be financed by Fortress and (y) an entity holding the real estate assets of the
Company ("RealCo"), which will be financed by Fortress or other mortgage lenders in lieu of the Bridge Loan Facility.

        The Fortress Facilities will be available in a single drawing on the closing date. The letters of credit and the proceeds of loans under the Wells Facility (except as set forth
below) will be available on the closing of the merger to refinance debt of the Company, pay fees and expenses and a portion of the merger consideration and for general corporate
purposes after the consummation of the merger.

        Interest under the Fortress Facilities will be either (i) the "ABR Rate" (which is the highest of (a) the prime rate as announced in the Wall Street Journal, (b) the federal funds
effective rate from time to time plus 0.50% per annum and (c) the 1-month Published LIBOR Rate plus 1.00% per annum) plus the "Applicable Margin" (which is (x) under the
First Lien Facility, 6.00% in the case of ABR Loans and 7.00% in the case of Eurodollar Loans, (y) under the Second Lien Facility, 8.00% in the case of ABR Loans and 9.00%
in the case of Eurodollar Loans and (z)(I) under the Bridge Loan Facility, 5.00% in the case of ABR Loans and 6.00% in the case of Eurodollar Loans from the closing date to the
first anniversary of the closing date of the Fortress Facilities or (II) 7.00% or 8.00%, respectively, after the first anniversary of the closing date of the Fortress Facilities) or (ii) the
Eurodollar Rate (which is the higher of (a) the rate for Eurodollar deposits for the relevant period or (b) 1.00% per annum) plus the "Applicable Margin" (as defined above).

        The obligations under the Fortress Facilities will be guaranteed by a new Delaware limited liability company formed by Merger Sub that is a passive holding company
("SuperHoldCo"), IPCo and RealCo and their holding companies and each of IPCo's and RealCo's domestic subsidiaries, and if SuperHoldCo holds directly less than 100% but
more than 50% ownership of OpCo's parent or SuperHoldCo owns and controls legally and beneficially directly less than 100% but more than 50% of the equity of OpCo's
parent with ordinary voting power to elect the board memebersof such entity (either of such events, the "Springing OpCo Parent Guaranty"), then OpCo's parent will become a
guarantor as well (subject to customary restrictions and provided, however, that if the Bridge Loan Facility is not utilized, RealCo's parent, RealCo and its subsidiaries will not be
guarantors but 100% of the equity of RealCo's parent will be pledged under the applicable Fortress Facilities). The Fortress Facilities will be secured, subject to permitted liens
and other agreed upon exceptions, by substantially

all of the present and after-acquired assets of IPCo, RealCo and each guarantor (subject to exceptions for RealCo's parent and its subsidiaries if the Bridge Loan Facility is not
utilized), including (i) a pledge of all of the capital stock of each of IPCo and RealCo, (ii) a pledge of all of the capital stock directly held by each of IPCo and RealCo or any
guarantor in certain direct and indirect subsidiaries with certain exceptions, including limitations on the pledge of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries (and RealCo's parent as
described above), (iii) if the Springing OpCo Parent Guaranty occurs, a pledge of all the capital stock directly held by SuperHoldCo in OpCo's parent, and (iv) security interests
in, and mortgages on, substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of each of IPCo and RealCo and each guarantor (including accounts receivable, inventory, equipment,
general intangibles, investment property, intellectual property, material fee-owned real property), intercompany notes and proceeds of the foregoing.

        Interest under the Wells Facility will be calculated based on whether the loan is considered to be a "US Loan", "Canadian Loan" or "UK Loan". The interest of each of those
loans is computed by adding the LIBOR Rate or an alternative base rate to the "Applicable Margin". The Applicable Margin is based on a grid in the Wells Commitment Letter
that lists interest margins based on the borrowing availability under the Wells Facility for the following types of loans: (i) LIBOR/UK base rate (1.25% - 1.75%), (ii) US base rate
(0.25% - 0.75%) and (iii) Canadian base rate (1.25% - 1.75%). The Applicable Margin is increased by 0.25% for each level in the grid during the seasonal advance period. The
definition of the "LIBOR Rate" is customary, includes a 0% floor and is available for an interest period of one, two, three or six months. The definition of each (Canadian, UK
and US) "alternative base rates" is also customary for such currency and each includes a 0% floor as well.

        The obligations under the Wells Facility will be guaranteed by the Company, OpCo's parent and each of OpCo's existing directly held subsidiaries that are not borrowers
("Wells Loan Parties"), subject to customary exceptions (such as non-material subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries exceptions). The Wells Facility will be secured by (subject to
customary exceptions) all the current assets and certain other assets of the Wells Loan Parties, including accounts receivable, payment intangibles, deposit accounts and
inventory.

        The Debt Commitment Letters expire on the earliest of (i) any valid termination of the merger agreement (including the termination date), (ii) 11:59 p.m. New York City
time on December 15, 2018 and (iii) the date of the closing of the merger agreement without use of the Fortress Facilities or the Wells Facility, as applicable. There are no current
plans to repay the debt to be incurred in connection with the merger.

        Wells Fargo's and Fortress' commitments to provide the debt financing are subject to, among other things:

• the execution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the applicable Facilities consistent with the Debt Commitment Letters (including the term
sheets); 

• the accuracy of (i) certain specified representations and warranties made by the Company, borrowers and guarantors in the definitive documentation of the
applicable debt facilities and (ii) the representations and warranties made by the Company in the merger agreement as are material to the interests of the lenders,
but only to the extent that Parent or its applicable affiliate has the right to terminate its (or such entity's) obligations under the merger agreement as a result of a
breach of such representations and warranties; 

• the consummation of the merger (without any amendments to the merger agreement or any waivers thereof in any material respect that are materially adverse to
the lenders (in their capacity as such) without the consent of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letters (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed)) substantially simultaneously with the initial borrowing under any of the Facilities; provided (i) that any reduction in the purchase price for

the merger will not be deemed to be materially adverse to the lenders to the extent 10% of such reduction is applied to reduce the amount of commitments in
respect of the First Lien Facility, Second Lien Facility and Bridge Loan Facility, on a pro rata, dollar-for-dollar basis and (ii) any increase in the purchase price for
the merger will not be deemed to be materially adverse to the lenders to the extent such increase is funded by the Wells Facility or other sources available to
Parent;

• prior to or substantially concurrently with the initial funding of the Facilities, the Rolled Equity Contribution (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letters) shall
have been consummated; 

• since June 15, 2018, there shall not have occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the merger agreement);

delivery of a solvency certificate from the chief financial officer, chief accounting officer or other officer with equivalent duties of the Company in substantially
the form attached to the Debt Commitment Letters; 

• at least 15 business days prior to the closing of the Facilities, the delivery of documentation and other information about the Company, the borrowers and
guarantors required under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations (including the PATRIOT Act) requested in writing at
least 20 business days prior to the date of initial funding under the Facilities and consummation of the merger; 

• OpCo having at least $30 million of liquidity (in the case of the Fortress Facilities) and excess availability of at least 20% of the loan cap (or 17.5% if the closing
occurs in November 2018) (in the case of the Wells Facility); 

• execution and delivery of documents and instruments required to perfect the security interest in the collateral, in the proper form for filing (if applicable) (it being
understood that, to the extent any collateral (other than certain specified assets) cannot be provided or perfected on the closing date after commercially reasonable
efforts to do so or without undue burden or expense, the provision and/or perfection of such collateral will not constitute a condition precedent to the availability
of the Facilities on the closing date, but will be required to be provided and/or perfected within 90 days after the closing date (subject to extensions in the
reasonable discretion of the applicable lenders); and 

• payment of specified fees and expenses due to the parties to the Debt Commitment Letters, to the extent invoiced before a specified date.

        The parties to the Debt Commitment Letters may not assign all or any portion of their commitments thereunder (except to affiliates in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letters) until after the consummation of the merger and, unless agreed in writing by Parent and Merger Sub, each party to the Debt Commitment Letters shall retain
exclusive control over all rights and obligations with respect to its commitments under its respective Facilities, including all rights with respect to consents, modifications,
waivers and amendments, until the closing date of the applicable Facilities has occurred.

        The debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letters are not conditioned upon a successful syndication of any of the Facilities with other financial institutions.

Limited Guarantee 

        In connection with the merger agreement, George Feldenkreis has executed a limited non-recourse guarantee in favor of the Company to guarantee, subject to the limitations

hold the 2018 Annual Meeting unless compelled by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to applicable law, and in furtherance of the foregoing the Company shall, upon the
request of a shareholder seeking to compel the 2018 Annual Meeting, use its commercially reasonable efforts to resist any such motion by a shareholder and also to use its

Parent or the GF Group in connection with the 2018 Annual Meeting is limited to the nominees for director identified by George Feldenkreis in his May 18, 2018 nomination
notice submitted to the Company in connection with the 2018 Annual Meeting, then clause (b) of the first sentence of this paragraph shall immediately terminate upon the
Company's receipt of a written notice of Parent notifying the Company of Parent's intent to solicit proxies in opposition of the Company's nominations for directors of the
Company at the 2018 Annual Meeting; provided, that, in order for George Feldenkreis, the financing sources of Parent and the GF Group to exercise such rights, if Parent has a
right to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to specified provisions thereof, George Feldenkreis shall continue to use his reasonable best efforts to consummate the merger in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

        The limited guarantee will terminate as of the earliest to occur of (i) the effective time of the merger and (ii) 75 days following the termination of the merger agreement in
accordance with its terms, unless one or more claims with respect to one or more guaranteed obligations has been asserted by the Company in writing against George Feldenkreis
prior to the end of such 75-day period, in which case the limited guarantee will continue in effect until the resolution of such claims and satisfaction, to the extent required, of
such guaranteed obligations, whereupon the limited guarantee will terminate.

the limited guarantee. The pledged certificated shares of Company Common Stock are held in an escrow account maintained by Citibank, National Association and under the
control of the Special Committee.

        The pledge and security agreement will terminate as of the latest to occur of (i) immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (but subject to the occurrence of the
effective time of the merger) or (ii) the termination of the limited guarantee. Upon such termination, the 647,451 shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as

Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the board of directors, you should be aware that certain directors and executive officers of Perry Ellis have interests in the merger,
including those described below and as described in "Advisory Vote on "Golden Parachute Compensation" " beginning on page 143, that are different from, or in addition to,
their or your interests as a shareholder. George Feldenkreis, a member of the board of directors, and Oscar Feldenkreis, the chief executive officer and member of the board of
directors, are members of the GF Group and are Rollover Investors and will

have equity interests in Parent after the consummation of the merger. These interests may create conflicts of interest. The Special Committee and the board of directors were
aware of these interests during their deliberations on the merits of the merger and in making their decision to recommend and approve, respectively, the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.

        Certain of the directors and executive officers of the Company participated in the negotiation of the terms of the merger agreement, and the Special Committee, after careful
consideration, voted unanimously to recommend to the board of directors that it, and thereafter the board of directors, after careful consideration and acknowledging the interest
of George Feldenkreis and Oscar Feldenkreis in the merger, voted unanimously to, recommend that the Company shareholders vote in favor of (i) the merger agreement, the
merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) the "golden parachute compensation" and (iii) the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to adopt the merger agreement. These directors and executive officers
may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of the Company's shareholders. These interests include the continued employment of certain
executive officers of the Company by the surviving corporation, the continued service of certain directors of the Company, the treatment of equity-based awards in the merger,
severance and other benefits under the change in control severance plan and the employment agreements and other rights held by the board of directors and executive officers and
the indemnification of members of the board of directors and officers by the surviving corporation. Company shareholders should be aware of these interests when they consider
board of directors' recommendations that they vote in favor of (i) the merger agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) the "golden
parachute compensation" and (iii) the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
Special Meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Directors' and Officers' Insurance

        Parent has agreed to maintain, and to cause the surviving corporation to maintain for at least six years following the effective time of the merger the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous with respect to
claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the effective time of the merger (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of the merger
agreement and the consummation of the merger). Such policies shall not have an annual premium in excess of 250% of the renewal premium being paid by the Company in
connection with its June 2018 renewal. In lieu of Parent purchasing such policy after the effective time of the merger, the Company may, prior to the effective time of the merger,
purchase a "tail" directors' and officers' liability policy covering the aforementioned matters at a cost not to exceed 250% of the renewal premium paid by the Company in
connection with its June 2018 renewal and if the Company purchases such a policy prior to the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation shall maintain such policy
for six years following the effective time.

        In addition, for a period of six years after the effective time of the merger, Parent and the surviving corporation have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries against all costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action, arbitration, litigation, suit or other civil or criminal proceeding or governmental
investigation, including liabilities with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or relating to their services as directors, officers or employees of the Company or its
subsidiaries occurring prior to the effective time, whether asserted or claimed before, at or after the effective time of the merger.

        For a period of six years following the effective time, Parent and the surviving corporation have also agreed to cause all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation now existing in favor of any present or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as provided in (i) the Company's
organizational and governing documents, or (ii) any indemnification agreement to survive the merger and to continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years
after the effective time or, if longer, for such period as is set forth in any applicable indemnification agreement.

Merger Proceeds in Respect of Company Equity-Based Awards

Treatment of Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock Awards

        In connection with the consummation of the merger, (i) each stock option and stock appreciation right, whether or not then exercisable or vested, will be converted into the
right to receive at the closing cash equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share exercise price of the applicable option or stock
appreciation right and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such stock option or stock appreciation right; (ii) each restricted stock award not subject
to any performance-based vesting condition held by an employee will be automatically vested and converted into the right to receive at the closing cash equal to the product of
(a) the per share merger consideration and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award; (iii) each restricted stock award not
subject to any performance-based vesting condition held by a non-employee member of the board of directors will vest on a prorated basis based on the number of days that have
elapsed since the grant date of such award and be converted into the right to receive at the closing cash equal to the product of (a) the per share merger consideration and (b) such
pro-rated number of shares; and (iv) with the exception of certain management members described below, each restricted stock award subject to any performance-based vesting
condition will be converted into a right to receive a restricted cash award from the surviving corporation that will vest and be payable (without regard to any performance goals
but subject to applicable service vesting conditions in the prior award) at the end of its currently applicable vesting period, with the cash payment therefor equal to the product of:
(a) the per share merger consideration and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award that would have vested based on target
level achievement. Such restricted cash award will accelerate upon a termination without cause or for good reason prior to the scheduled vesting date. Each restricted stock award
subject to any performance-based vesting condition held by Mr. Jorge Narino or Ms. Tricia McDermott Thompkins will be converted into a right to receive at the closing a cash
payment equal to the product of: (a) the per share merger consideration and (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award that
would have vested based on target level achievement. All outstanding restricted stock units held by George Feldenkreis will be cancelled.

        The following table shows, for each member of the board of directors and for each executive officer of the Company, as applicable: (1) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying outstanding stock appreciation rights and the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to unvested Company restricted stock awards
(assuming target level performance for performance vesting shares) and (2) the value of such awards. The values in the table below have been determined using the per share
merger consideration of $27.50, and are based on applicable holdings as of August 31,

officers, other than Messrs. Feldenkreis and Silverstein, were not entitled to any severance on a termination of employment other than pursuant to the Company's informal policy
of providing severance of two weeks of base salary per year of service with the Company. The merger, if and when consummated, will constitute a change in control under the
change in control severance plan and will provide for the severance as described in further detail below. For Messrs. Feldenkreis and Silverstein, the severance benefits are not
enhanced by the merger because it does not constitute a change in control pursuant to the applicable employment agreement. For purposes of the change in control severance
plan, "Change in Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (i) the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) of more than 50% of either (A) the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") or
(B) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting
Securities") (the foregoing beneficial ownership hereinafter being referred to as a "Controlling Interest"); provided, however, that the following acquisitions shall not constitute or
result in a Change in Control: (v) any acquisition directly from the Company; (w) any acquisition by the Company; (x) any acquisition by any person that as of April 22, 2018
owns beneficial ownership of a Controlling Interest; (y) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any
subsidiary; or (z) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction which complies with clauses (A), (B) and (C) of subsection (iii) below; or (ii) consummation of a
reorganization, merger, statutory share exchange or consolidation or similar corporate transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, a sale or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the acquisition of assets or stock of another entity by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each, a "Business
Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business Combination, (A) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners,
respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation which as a
result of such transaction owns the Company or all or substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same
proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as
the case may be, (B) no person (excluding any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation resulting from such business combination or any
person that as of April 22, 2018 owns beneficial ownership of a Controlling Interest) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of
common stock of the corporation resulting from such business combination or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation except to
the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Business Combination and (C) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from
such Business Combination were members of the board of directors as of April 22, 2018, at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the board of
directors, providing for such Business Combination; or (iii) approval by the shareholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

        Each of the Company's executive officers (other than Messrs. Feldenkreis and Silverstein) is covered by the change in control severance plan, which provides for the
payment of severance benefits to certain senior executive officers of the Company or its affiliates that have been selected by the chief executive officer and confirmed by the
compensation committee of the board of directors and the Company's management, if their employment is involuntarily terminated by the Company without "cause" or
terminated by the applicable executive for "good reason" within twelve (12) months

following a Change in Control (each, as defined in the change in control severance plan, and such termination, a "Qualifying Termination"). In addition to accrued but unpaid
base salary, earned vacation time, unreimbursed business expenses incurred prior to termination and other vested compensation or benefits through the date of termination, the
change in control severance plan provides for the following severance benefits upon a Qualifying Termination: (i) continued base salary during the applicable severance period,
(ii) a prorated annual cash bonus for the year of termination, based on actual full-year performance, and (iii) COBRA premiums during the applicable severance period. The
executive officers who participate in the change in control severance plan have a severance period of 18 months.

        The eligibility for severance benefits under the change in control severance plan is conditioned upon the participant's timely execution of a general release of all claims
against the Company and its subsidiaries, affiliates and related persons. The change in control severance plan also contains restrictive covenants, including perpetual restrictions
on the disclosure of confidential information and nondisparagment and post-employment restrictions on competition, solicitation or hire of employees and solicitation of
customers during the severance period. If a participant violates the restrictive covenants, such participant will not be entitled to any further payments or benefits under the change
in control severance plan.

        Under the change in control severance plan, if any payments and benefits (i) constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G ("280G Payments") of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and (ii) would otherwise be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the 280G Payments
will be either: (a) delivered in full or (b) delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to such excise tax, whichever of the
foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, results in the receipt by the
participant on an after-tax basis of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code.

        Oscar Feldenkreis Employment Agreement.    Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis entered into an employment agreement with the Company on April 20, 2016, which expires on
February 4, 2019. The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement do not constitute a "Change in Control" within the meaning of this employment agreement. Upon
termination of Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis' employment agreement without "cause" or for "good reason" (each as defined in the employment agreement), he will receive (a) his base
salary earned but not paid prior to the date of termination, (b) all annual incentive compensation awards with respect to any year prior to the year in which his termination
occurred, which have been earned but have not yet been paid, and (c) 100% of his annual incentive compensation award based on the achievement of any applicable performance
goals with respect to the year in which the termination occurs. All restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights and all other equity-based long-
term incentive compensation awards will immediately vest as of the termination date except in the case of performance shares, performance units and other performance-based
equity awards, which will vest based on the achievement of the performance goals. All long-term performance-based compensation payable in cash and based on a performance
metric other than stock price will be paid based on the achievement of the performance goals. Additionally, Mr. Oscar Feldenkreis will receive a lump-sum cash payment equal to
200% of the sum of (a) the greater of (i) his base salary at the time of termination or (ii) his base salary immediately prior to any reduction that would constitute good reason, plus
(b) the greater of (i) the target bonus in effect at the time of termination or (ii) the target bonus immediately prior to any reduction that would constitute good reason. Finally all
premiums for health insurance will be paid in full by the Company for as long as he is eligible for COBRA coverage.

transactions contemplated by the merger agreement do not constitute a "Change in Control" within the meaning of the Mr. Silverstein's employment agreement. If Mr. Silverstein
is terminated without "cause" (as defined in the employment agreement) prior to January 31, 2019, he will be entitled to receive a lump-sum amount equal to (a) any annual
bonus in respect of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which Mr. Silverstein's employment ends and which has not yet been paid and (b) 100% of his annual base salary.
Mr. Silverstein's unvested restricted shares will also immediately vest.

        We estimate that the amount payable to the Company's executive officers pursuant to the terms of their respective severance arrangements (excluding the value of
accelerating Perry Ellis equity awards) would equal approximately the amounts set forth on the table below, assuming that the consummation of the merger was August 31, 2018,
and that each executive officer incurred a severance-qualifying termination of employment immediately following the consummation of the merger.

Benefit Arrangements of the Surviving Corporation

        As described under "The Merger Agreement—Covenants of Parent and/or Merger Sub—Employee Matters" beginning on page 131, the merger agreement requires the
surviving corporation to continue to provide certain compensation and benefits following the completion of the merger to all Perry Ellis employees, including Perry Ellis's
executive officers, who remain employed by the Company following completion of the merger.

New Management Arrangements

        As of the date of this Proxy Statement, Parent has not entered into any employment agreements with any of the Company's executive officers (or other employees of the
Company) and, except for the accelerated vesting of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock awards, and conversion of performance awards into restricted
cash awards, as provided in the merger agreement and described above, the Company has not amended or modified any existing employment agreements or other arrangements
with its executive officers in connection with the merger. Parent or its affiliates may pursue agreements, arrangements or understandings with the Company's executive officers,
which may include cash, stock and co-investment opportunities, and Parent or its affiliates may initiate negotiations of these arrangements, arrangements and understandings
regarding employment with, or the right to participate in the equity of, the surviving corporation or Parent on a going-forward basis following the completion of the merger.
However, in each case, there is no present contractual obligation to do so and neither Parent nor its affiliates has initiated any such negotiation as of the date of this Proxy
Statement.

Intent to Vote in Favor of the Merger

        Our directors and executive officers have informed us that, as of the date of this Proxy Statement, they intend to vote all of the shares of Company Common Stock owned
directly by them in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of August 16, 2018, the record date for the Special Meeting, our directors and executive officers directly

Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or collectively approximately 20.7% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting. As of August 16, 2018, the record date for the Special Meeting, our directors and executive officers that are not party to the voting agreement (as described in "Special
Factors—Voting Agreement" beginning on page 91) directly owned, in the aggregate, 351,580 shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or
collectively approximately 2.2% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.

Voting Agreement 

        Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, the Rollover Investors have entered into a voting agreement with Parent and the Company that
covers an aggregate of approximately 19.8% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Shares"). Under the terms of the voting agreement, the Rollover
Investors have agreed to vote, or cause to be voted, the Shares (A) to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, at
the Special Meeting, and at any adjournment, postponement or recess thereof, at which such merger agreement is submitted for the consideration and vote of the shareholders of
the Company, (B) against (i) any takeover proposal and (ii) any other action, agreement or transaction that would reasonably be expected to materially impede, interfere with,
delay or postpone the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and (C) in favor of any other matter necessary to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and considered and voted upon by the shareholders of the Company.

        The Rollover Investors further agreed in the voting agreement with Parent and the Company to irrevocably appoint the Company, each member of the Special Committee,
and any other designee of Company or the Special Committee, as applicable, and each of them individually, as the sole and exclusive attorneys-in-fact and proxies of the
Rollover Investors, for and in the name, place and stead of the Rollover Investors, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote, grant a consent or approval in
respect of, or execute and deliver a proxy to vote, solely to the extent the Rollover Investors fail to comply with the agreements discussed above, the Shares, in accordance with
the obligations of the Rollover Investors discussed above.

        The Rollover Investors have also agreed in the voting agreement with Parent and the Company not to, directly or indirectly, (i) grant any proxies or enter into any voting
trust or other agreement or arrangement with respect to the voting of any Shares; (ii) other than pursuant to the pledge and security agreement by George Feldenkreis in favor of
the Company, transfer, in any way, any interest in the Shares, unless such transfer is made in compliance with the voting agreement (including certain customary permitted
transferee exceptions), or (iii) knowingly take any action that would have the effect of preventing or delaying the Rollover Investors from performing any of their obligations
under the voting agreement.

        The voting agreement was entered into by the Rollover Investors solely in their capacity as shareholders of the Company, and the voting agreement does not limit or affect
any actions taken by any officer or director of the Company solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company.

        The Rollover Investors' obligations under the voting agreement will automatically terminate without any further action required by any person upon the earliest to occur of
(i) the mutual agreement of the parties thereto to terminate the voting agreement; (ii) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, and (iii) the effective
time of the merger.

agreement is attached as

exhibit (d)(11) to the statement on Schedule 13E-3 filed by the Company and the filing persons listed thereon with the SEC on July 11, 2018.

Dividends 

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, we are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends following execution of the merger agreement on June 15, 2018.

Appraisal Rights 

        Holders of Company Common Stock as of the record date are entitled to appraisal rights under the FBCA. Pursuant to the FBCA, a Company shareholder who does not
wish to accept the consideration to be received pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement may dissent from the merger and elect to receive the fair value of his or her shares
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the date of the Special Meeting to vote on the proposal to approve the merger agreement, excluding any appreciation or
depreciation in anticipation of the merger unless exclusion would be inequitable.

        In order to exercise appraisal rights, a dissenting Company shareholder must strictly comply with the statutory procedures of Sections 607.1301 through 607.1333 of the
FBCA, which are summarized below. A copy of the full text of those Sections is included as Appendix C to this Proxy Statement. Company shareholders are urged to read
Appendix C in its entirety and to consult with their legal advisors. Each Company shareholder who desires to assert his or her appraisal rights is cautioned that failure on his or
her part to adhere strictly to the requirements of Florida law in any regard will cause a forfeiture of any appraisal rights.

Procedures for Exercising Dissenters' Rights of Appraisal

        The following summary of Florida law is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the applicable provisions of the FBCA, a copy of which are included as
Appendix C to this Proxy Statement.

        A dissenting shareholder, who desires to exercise his or her appraisal rights, must file with the Company, prior to the taking of the vote on the merger, a written notice of
intent to demand payment for his or her shares if the merger is effectuated. A vote against the adoption and approval of the merger agreement will not alone be deemed to be the
written notice of intent to demand payment and will not be deemed to satisfy the notice requirements under the FBCA. A dissenting shareholder need not vote against the merger
agreement, but cannot vote, or allow any nominee who holds such shares for the dissenting shareholder to vote, any of his or her shares of Company Common Stock in favor of
adoption and approval of the merger agreement. A vote in favor of adoption and approval of the merger agreement will constitute a waiver of the shareholder's appraisal rights.
Such written notification should be delivered either in person or by mail (certified mail, return receipt requested, being the recommended form of transmittal) to:

Perry Ellis International, Inc.
3000 N.W. 107th Avenue

Miami, Florida 33172
Attention: Tricia Thompkins, General Counsel and Secretary

        All such notices must be signed in the same manner as the shares are registered on the books of the Company. If a Company shareholder has not provided written notice of
intent to demand fair value before the vote on the proposal to adopt and approve the merger agreement is taken at the Special Meeting, then the Company shareholder will be
deemed to have waived his or her appraisal rights.

Table of Contents

        Within 10 days after the completion of the merger, the surviving corporation must provide to each Company shareholder who filed a notice of intent to demand payment for
his or her shares a written appraisal notice and an appraisal election form that specifies, among other things:

• the date of the completion of the merger; 

• the surviving corporation's estimate of the fair value of the shares of Company Common Stock; 

• where to return the completed appraisal election form and the shareholder's stock certificates and the date by which they must be received by the surviving
corporation or its agent, which date may not be fewer than 40, nor more than 60, days after the date the surviving corporation sent the appraisal notice and
appraisal election form to the shareholder; and 

• the date by which a notice from the Company shareholder of his or her desire to withdraw his or her appraisal election must be received by the surviving
corporation, which date must be within 20 days after the date set for receipt by the surviving corporation of the appraisal election form from the Company
shareholder.

        The form must also contain the surviving corporation's offer to pay to the Company shareholder the amount that it has estimated as the fair value of the shares of Company
Common Stock, and request certain information from the Company shareholder, including:

• the shareholder's name and address; 

• the number of shares as to which the shareholder is asserting appraisal rights; 

• that the shareholder did not vote for the merger; 

• whether the shareholder accepts the offer of the surviving corporation to pay its estimate of the fair value of the shares of Company Common Stock to the
shareholder; and 

• if the shareholder does not accept the offer of the surviving corporation, the shareholder's estimated fair value of the shares of Company Common Stock and a
demand for payment of the shareholder's estimated value plus interest.

        A dissenting shareholder must submit the certificate(s) representing his or her shares with the appraisal election form. Any dissenting shareholder failing to return a properly
completed appraisal election form and his or her stock certificates within the period stated in the form will lose his or her appraisal rights and be bound by the terms of the merger
agreement.

        Upon returning the appraisal election form, a dissenting shareholder will be entitled only to payment pursuant to the procedure set forth in the applicable sections of the
FBCA and will not be entitled to vote or to exercise any other rights of a shareholder, unless the dissenting shareholder withdraws his or her demand for appraisal within the time
period specified in the appraisal election form.

        A dissenting shareholder who has delivered the appraisal election form and his or her Company Common Stock certificates may decline to exercise appraisal rights and
withdraw from the appraisal process by giving written notice to the surviving corporation within the time period specified in the appraisal election form. Thereafter, a dissenting
shareholder may not withdraw from the appraisal process without the written consent of the surviving corporation. Upon such withdrawal, the right of the dissenting shareholder
to be paid the fair value of his or her shares will cease, and he or she will be reinstated as a shareholder and will be entitled to receive the merger consideration.

        If the dissenting shareholder accepts the offer of the surviving corporation in the appraisal election form to pay the surviving corporation's estimate of the fair value of the
shares of Company Common Stock, payment for the shares of the dissenting shareholder is to be made within 90 days after the

receipt of the appraisal election form by the surviving corporation or its agent. Upon payment of the agreed value, the dissenting shareholder will cease to have any interest in
such shares.

        A shareholder must demand appraisal rights with respect to all of the shares registered in his or her name, except that a record shareholder may assert appraisal rights as to
fewer than all of the shares registered in the record shareholder's name but which are owned by a beneficial shareholder, if the record shareholder objects with respect to all
shares owned by the beneficial shareholder. A record shareholder must notify the Company in writing of the name and address of each beneficial shareholder on whose behalf
appraisal rights are being asserted. A beneficial shareholder may assert appraisal rights as to any shares held on behalf of the beneficial shareholder only if the beneficial
shareholder submits to the Company the record shareholder's written consent to the assertion of such rights before the date specified in the appraisal notice, and does so with
respect to all shares that are beneficially owned by the beneficial shareholder.

        Section 607.1330 of the FBCA addresses what should occur if a dissenting shareholder fails to accept the offer of the surviving corporation to pay the value of the shares as
estimated by the surviving corporation, and the surviving corporation fails to comply with the demand of the dissenting shareholder to pay the value of the shares as estimated by
the dissenting shareholder, plus interest.

        If a dissenting shareholder refuses to accept the offer of the surviving corporation to pay the value of the shares as estimated by the surviving corporation, and the surviving
corporation fails to comply with the demand of the dissenting shareholder to pay the value of the shares as estimated by the dissenting shareholder, plus interest, then within
60 days after receipt of a written demand from any dissenting shareholder given within 60 days after the date on which the merger was effected, the surviving corporation shall,
or at its election at any time within such period of 60 days may, file an action in any court of competent jurisdiction in the county in Florida where the registered office of the
surviving corporation, maintained pursuant to Florida law, is located requesting that the fair value of such shares be determined by the court.

        If the surviving corporation fails to institute a proceeding within the above-prescribed period, any dissenting shareholder may do so in the name of the surviving corporation.
A copy of the initial pleading will be served on each dissenting shareholder. The surviving corporation is required to pay each dissenting shareholder the amount found to be due
within 10 days after final determination of the proceedings, which amount may, in the discretion of the court, include a fair rate of interest, which will also be determined by the
court. Upon payment of the judgment, the dissenting shareholder ceases to have any interest in such shares.

        Section 607.1331 of the FBCA provides that the costs of a court appraisal proceeding, including reasonable compensation for, and expenses of, appraisers appointed by the
court, will be determined by the court and assessed against the surviving corporation, except that the court may assess costs against all or some of the dissenting shareholders, in
amounts determined by the court, to the extent that the court finds such shareholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith with respect to their appraisal rights. The
court also may assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in amounts determined by the court, against: (i) the surviving corporation and in
favor of any or all dissenting shareholders if the court finds the surviving corporation did not substantially comply with the notification provisions set forth in Sections 607.1320
and 607.1322 of the FBCA; or (ii) either the surviving corporation or a dissenting shareholder, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees
and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the appraisal rights. If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the services of
counsel for any dissenting shareholder were of substantial benefit to other dissenting shareholders, and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against the surviving
corporation, the court may award to such counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded the dissenting shareholders who were benefited. To the extent that the
surviving

corporation fails to make a required payment when a dissenting shareholder accepts the surviving corporation's offer to pay the value of the shares as estimated by the surviving
corporation, the dissenting shareholder may sue directly for the amount owed and, to the extent successful, shall be entitled to recover from the surviving corporation all costs
and expenses of the suit, including counsel fees.

        Based on Florida's appraisal rights statute as well as principles of waiver and estoppel, the Company intends to take the position with respect to any lawsuit seeking recovery
outside of the appraisal rights process that appraisal rights represent the exclusive remedy to challenge the merger consideration and that any shareholder who either (i) votes for
the adoption of the merger agreement, (ii) does not exercise appraisal rights or (iii) accepts merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement, will have waived and
relinquished all claims arising out of or relating to the consideration provided to the Company's shareholders under the merger agreement and be barred from seeking recovery of
other consideration.

        BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROVISIONS OF FLORIDA LAW RELATING TO DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS, SHAREHOLDERS WHO ARE
CONSIDERING DISSENTING FROM THE MERGER ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN LEGAL ADVISORS.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 

        Except as specifically described below, the following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to "U.S. holders" and "non-U.S.
holders" (in each case, as defined below) of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger, that
hold such shares as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment) and that will not own (actually or constructively) any
equity interests in the surviving corporation or Parent after the merger. The following discussion is based upon the Code, judicial decisions, administrative rulings and existing
and proposed Treasury regulations, all as in effect as of the date hereof. All of the preceding authorities are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, so as to result in
U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. The Company has not requested, and will not request, a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (the "IRS") with respect to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below, and as a result there can be no assurance that the IRS will not disagree with
or challenge any of the conclusions the Company has reached and described herein.

        This discussion is not a complete analysis or listing of all of the possible tax consequences of the merger and does not address all tax considerations that might be relevant to
particular holders in light of their personal circumstances or to persons that are subject to special tax rules. In addition, this discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences does not address the tax treatment of special classes of holders, such as: banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions; mutual funds; real estate
investment trusts or regulated investment companies; tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations; an entity or arrangement treated for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a partnership, S-corporation or other pass-through entity (or an investor in such an entity or arrangement); controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment
companies or corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax (or shareholders of such corporations); retirement plans, pension funds or other tax-deferred
accounts; persons holding shares of Company Common Stock as part of a hedging, straddle, synthetic security, conversion or other integrated transaction; persons deemed to
have sold their shares of Company Common Stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code; persons who acquired Company Common Stock through the exercise or
cancellation of employee stock options, through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation for their services; U.S. expatriates or entities covered by the U.S.
anti-inversion rules;

Table of Contents

persons subject to the alternative minimum tax; dealers, traders or brokers in stocks and securities or currencies; U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not
the U.S. dollar; traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment; U.S. holders (as defined below) who hold shares of Company Common Stock through a bank financial
institution or other entity, or a branch or office thereof, that is located, organized or resident outside the United States; or persons that are required to report income no later than
when such income is reported in an "applicable financial statement." This discussion also does not address the receipt of cash in connection with the cancellation of restricted
stock units or options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and does not address any other matters relating to equity compensation or benefit plans.

        This discussion does not address any tax consequences other than U.S. federal income tax consequences, including estate and gift tax consequences and consequences under
any state, local or non-U.S. laws.

        For purposes of this section, the term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of Company Common Stock that is: (i) an individual citizen of the United States or a resident
of the United States as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or
organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation
regardless of its source or (iv) a trust (a) if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more U.S.
persons have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a domestic
trust.

        The term "non-U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of Company Common Stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, trust or estate
that is not a U.S. holder. The term "holder" means a U.S. holder or a non-U.S. holder.

        If an entity treated as a partnership (or other pass-through entity) for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of Company Common Stock, the U.S. federal
income tax treatment of a partner or other owner will generally depend upon the status of the partner (or other owner) and the activities of the partner (or other owner) and the
entity. If you are a partner (or other owner) of a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding
the tax consequences of the merger.

        The following discussion is for general information only and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any holder or prospective
holder of Company Common Stock and no opinion or representation with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences to any such holder or prospective holder
is made. Each holder of Company Common Stock is urged to consult such holder's tax advisors as to the particular consequences to such holder of the merger under
U.S. federal, state and local, and applicable non-U.S. tax laws.

U.S. Holders

        General.    The exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder of
Company Common Stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger generally will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received (determined prior to reduction for any applicable withholding taxes) and the U.S.
holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis generally will equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares. Such gain or loss will be capital
gain or loss and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for the shares of Company Common Stock exceeds one year at the effective time of the
merger. If the holding period for such shares is one year or less at the effective time of the merger, any capital gain or loss generally will be

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/900349/000104746918006097/a2236661zdefm14a.htm 106/275

Table of Contents

treated as short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Company Common Stock at different times or different prices, such
U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Company Common Stock.

        Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.    Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to payments made in connection with the merger. Backup
withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. holder of Company Common Stock that (1) furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN"), certifies that such U.S.
holder is not subject to backup withholding on the IRS Form W-9 (or appropriate successor form) included in the transmittal materials that such U.S. holder will receive, and
otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules; or (2) provides proof that such U.S. holder is otherwise exempt from backup withholding.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a U.S. holder's U.S. federal
income tax liability, if any; provided, that such U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner. The IRS may impose a penalty upon any taxpayer
that fails to provide the correct TIN.

Non-U.S. Holders

        General.    A non-U.S. holder's receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax unless:

• the gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required by an
applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment (or, in the case of an individual non-U.S. holder, a fixed base) maintained by the non-
U.S. holder in the United States); 

• the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger, and certain other conditions are
met; or 

• the Company is or has been a "United States real property holding corporation" as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the Code (a "USRPHC") for U.S.
federal income tax purposes and certain other conditions are met.

        A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will generally be subject to tax on any gain derived from the merger in the same manner as if it were
a U.S. holder. In addition, such a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits or such
lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point immediately above will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on any gain realized as a result of the merger, which may be offset by
certain U.S. source capital losses recognized in the same year.

        If the Company is or has been a USRPHC at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the effective time of the merger or a non-U.S. holder's holding
period with respect to the applicable shares of Company Common Stock, the exchange of Company Common Stock for cash in the merger by such non-U.S. holder will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, except that the branch profits tax will not apply; provided, that, so long as Company Common
Stock is regularly traded on an established securities market, the Company's treatment as a USRPHC would cause only a non-U.S. holder who holds or held, directly or indirectly
under certain ownership rules of the Code, more than 5% of Company Common Stock (at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or the period
that the non-U.S. holder

held Company Common Stock), and is not eligible for a treaty exemption. The Company believes that it is not, and has not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year
period preceding the offer.

        Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.    Information reporting and backup withholding will generally apply to payments made pursuant to the merger to a non-
U.S. holder effected by or through the U.S. office of any broker, U.S. or foreign, unless the holder certifies its status as a non-U.S. holder properly and correctly on an appropriate
version of IRS Form W-8 and satisfies certain other requirements, or otherwise establishes an exemption. Copies of applicable information returns reporting such payments and
any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the non-U.S. holder's country in which such holder resides under the provisions of an applicable treaty or
agreement. Payments of disposition proceeds to a non-U.S. holder where the transaction is effected through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker generally will not be subject to
backup withholding or information reporting. However, if such broker is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: a U.S. person; a controlled foreign corporation; a non-U.S. person
50% or more of whose gross income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business for a specified three-year period; or a non-U.S. partnership with certain connections to
the United States, then information reporting will be required unless the broker has in its records documentary evidence that the beneficial owner is not a U.S. person and certain
other conditions are met or the beneficial owner otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding may apply to any payment that such broker is required to report if the
broker has actual knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules from a payment to a non-U.S. holder can be refunded or credited against the non-U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability (if any) provided, that an
appropriate claim is timely filed with the IRS.

Regulatory Approvals 

        In connection with the merger, the Company is required to make certain filings with, and comply with certain laws of, various federal and state governmental agencies,
including:

• filing the articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida in accordance with the FBCA at the closing of the merger; and 

• complying with U.S. federal securities laws.

        In addition, under the HSR Act, and the related rules and regulations that have been issued by the FTC, certain transactions having a value above specified thresholds may
not be consummated until specified information and documentary material have been furnished to the applicable governmental authorities and certain waiting period
requirements have been satisfied or specific merger approval obtained. The requirements of the HSR Act apply to the acquisition of shares of Company Common Stock in the
merger. The filings required under the HSR Act were made on June 28, 2018, and on July 10, 2018, the FTC notified Paul, Weiss that the request for early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act had been granted effective as of the date of such notification.

Delisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock 

        If the merger is completed, the shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be publicly traded. In addition, Company Common Stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq
Global Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and the Company will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to Company Common
Stock.

Effective Time of Merger 

        The merger will be completed and become effective at the time the articles of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida or any later time as the
Company and Parent agree upon

and specify in the articles of merger. The parties intend to complete the merger as soon as practicable following the adoption of the merger agreement by the Company's
shareholders and satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing of the merger set forth in the merger agreement.

        The parties to the merger agreement currently expect to complete the merger in the second half of 2018. Because the merger is subject to a number of conditions, the exact
timing of the merger cannot be determined, if it is completed at all.

Payment of Merger Consideration and Surrender of Stock Certificates 

        At the effective time of the merger, the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and each shareholder of record immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger will be entitled to receive $27.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder
holds immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. This does not apply to (i) shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries, (ii) shares of Company Common Stock held by the Rollover Investors, and (iii) shares of Company Common Stock whose holders have
not voted in favor of adopting the merger agreement and have demanded and perfected their appraisal rights in accordance with, and have complied in all respects with, the
FBCA. Parent will designate a paying agent, satisfactory to the Company in its reasonable discretion, to make the cash payments contemplated by the merger agreement. At the
effective time of the merger, Parent will deposit with the paying agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, funds sufficient for payment of the aggregate
merger consideration. The paying agent will deliver to you your merger consideration according to the procedure summarized below.

        As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within three business days after the effective time of the merger, Parent will cause the paying agent to send you a letter
of transmittal and instructions advising you how to surrender your stock certificates (of affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry shares in exchange for the merger
consideration.

        The paying agent will promptly pay you your merger consideration after you have (i) surrendered your stock certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry
shares to the paying agent, together with a properly completed and signed letter of transmittal and any other documents required by the paying agent, and (ii) provided to the
paying agent any other items specified by the letter of transmittal.

        Interest will not be paid or accrue in respect of any cash payments of merger consideration. The surviving corporation will reduce the amount of any merger consideration
paid to you by any applicable withholding taxes.

        If the paying agent is to pay some or all of your merger consideration to a person other than you, you must have your stock certificates properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and you must pay any transfer or other taxes payable by reason of the transfer or establish to the surviving corporation's reasonable satisfaction that the
taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid.

        You should not forward your stock certificates to the paying agent without a letter of transmittal, and you should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy.

        The transmittal instructions will tell you what to do if you have lost your stock certificate, or if it has been stolen or destroyed. You will have to provide an affidavit to that
fact and, if required by the surviving corporation, post a bond in an amount that the surviving corporation reasonably directs as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it in respect of the stock certificate.

        After the completion of the merger, you will cease to have any rights as a Company shareholder, other than the right to receive the per share merger consideration.

        Upon demand, the paying agent will return to Parent all funds in its possession one year after the merger occurs, and the paying agent's duties will terminate. After that time,
if you have not received payment of the merger consideration, you may look only to Parent and/or the surviving corporation for payment of the merger consideration, without
interest, subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws. If any certificate representing Company Common Stock has not been surrendered prior to one year
after the completion of the merger (or such earlier date as shall be immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar law), the payment with respect to such certificate will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the surviving corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled to any claims or interest.

agreement;

agreement and the potential impact of such covenants on our business;

• the amount of fees, expenses and charges incurred by the Company in connection with the merger;

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

Time, Place and Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use at a Special Meeting to be held on Thursday, October 18, 2018 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, or at
any adjournments, postponements or recesses thereof, for the purposes set forth in this Proxy Statement and in the accompanying notice of Special Meeting. The Special Meeting
will be held at 3000 N.W. 107th Avenue, Miami, Florida, 33172.

        At the Special Meeting, the Company's shareholders are being asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement. The Company's shareholders are
also being asked to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
Special Meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

        Further, the Company's shareholders are being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve "golden parachute compensation" that may become payable under
existing agreements to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger.

        The Company does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the Special Meeting or any adjournment, postponement or recess thereof. If any other matters are
properly presented at the Special Meeting or any adjournment, postponement or recess thereof for consideration, however, the holders of the proxies will have discretion to vote
on these matters in accordance with their best judgment.

Special Committee and Board Recommendation 

        The Special Committee, after careful consideration, voted unanimously to recommend to the board of directors that it, and thereafter the board of directors, after
careful consideration and acknowledging the interest of George Feldenkreis and Oscar Feldenkreis in the merger, voted unanimously to (i) approve and declare
advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) declare that it is fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and the unaffiliated shareholders of the Company that the Company enter into the merger agreement and consummate the merger on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, (iii) direct that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the shareholders of the
Company and (iv) recommend to the shareholders of the Company that they vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement. For a discussion of the material factors
considered by the Special Committee and the board of directors in reaching its conclusions, see "Special Factors—Recommendation of the Special Committee and Our Board of
Directors; Reasons for Recommending the Adoption of the Merger Agreement; Fairness of the Merger" beginning on page 50.

        The board of directors recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, FOR the proposal to approve the "golden parachute
compensation" and FOR the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies.

Who is Entitled to Vote at the Special Meeting? 

        Only shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date, August 16, 2018, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting or any
adjournment, postponement or recess thereof. As of the close of business on August 16, 2018, there were outstanding 15,884,250 shares of Company Common Stock.

        Shareholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name.    If, on August 16, 2018, your shares were registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent,
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust, then you are a shareholder of record. As a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the Special Meeting or vote by proxy.

Table of Contents

        Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker, Bank or Other Agent.    If, on August 16, 2018, your shares were held in an account at a broker, bank or other
agent, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name". The organization holding your account is considered to be the shareholder of record for purposes of
voting at the Special Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other agent how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to
attend the Special Meeting. Because you are not the shareholder of record, however, you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you request and obtain
a valid proxy from your broker, bank or other agent.

How Do I Vote? 

        For Proposals 1, 2 and 3, you may vote FOR or AGAINST or abstain from voting. The procedures for voting are set forth below:

        Shareholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name.    If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the Special Meeting or by mailing your completed,
dated and signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope or by giving your proxy authorization via the Internet or by telephone. Whether or not you plan to attend the
Special Meeting, we encourage you to vote by proxy or give your proxy authorization to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the Special Meeting and vote in
person if you have already voted by proxy or given your proxy authorization.

• To vote in person, attend the Special Meeting, and we will provide you with a ballot when you arrive. 

• To vote by mail, submit a proxy by simply marking, signing and dating it, and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided. 

• To vote via telephone, submit a proxy by calling the toll-free number on the proxy card. You will then be prompted to enter the control number printed on your
proxy card and to follow the subsequent instructions. Submitting a proxy by telephone is available 24 hours a day. 

• To vote via the Internet, access the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card. You will then be prompted to enter the control number printed on your proxy
card and to follow the subsequent instructions. Submitting a proxy via the Internet is available 24 hours a day.

        We provide Internet proxy authorization on-line with procedures designed to ensure the authenticity and correctness of your proxy authorization instructions.
Please be aware, however, that you must bear any costs associated with your Internet access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and telephone
companies.

        Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker, Bank or Other Agent.    If you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank or
other agent, you should have received the Proxy Statement and proxy card from that organization rather than from Perry Ellis. You should follow the instructions provided by
your broker, bank or other agent as to how to vote your shares. To vote in person at the Special Meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or other agent. To
do this, follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other agent or contact your broker, bank or other agent to request a proxy card.

How Many Votes Do I Have? 

        For each matter to be voted upon, you have one vote for each share of Company Common Stock that you own as of the close of business on August 16, 2018. Shareholders
that own shares of Company Common Stock will vote together as a single class on all matters hereby submitted to shareholders and such other matters as may properly come
before the Special Meeting and any adjournment, postponement or recess thereof.

Table of Contents

What If I Request and Return a Proxy Card But Do Not Make Specific Choices? 

        If you request a proxy card and return the proxy card signed and dated without marking any voting selections, all of your shares of Company Common Stock will be voted
FOR the adoption of the merger agreement, FOR the approval of the "golden parachute compensation" and FOR the approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if
necessary, to solicit additional proxies in the event that there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
You should return a proxy even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person.

Can I Change My Vote After I Return My Proxy Card? 

        Yes. If you are the shareholder of record of your shares, you may revoke your proxy in any one of three ways:

• You may submit another properly completed proxy bearing a later date, or submit another proxy by Internet or telephone, which is received by Innisfree M&A
Incorporated, our proxy solicitor, before the start of the Special Meeting on October 18, 2018; 

• You may send a written notice which is received before the start of the Special Meeting on October 18, 2018 that you are revoking your proxy to 3000 N.W.
107th Avenue, Miami, Florida 33172, Attention: Tricia Thompkins, General Counsel and Secretary; or 

• You may attend the Special Meeting and notify the election officials that you wish to revoke your proxy and vote in person. Your attendance at the Special
Meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.

        If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other agent as your nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other agent.

How Are Votes Counted? 

        Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Special Meeting, who will separately count FOR and AGAINST votes, abstentions and broker non-
votes and separately count votes in respect of each proposal. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not receive instructions from
the beneficial owner with respect to the merger proposal, or the proposal for "golden parachute compensation," or the adjournment proposal, counted separately.

        Because Florida law requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to approve the adoption of the merger
agreement, the failure to vote, broker non-votes and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the merger proposal.

        Because the advisory vote to approve the "golden parachute compensation" and approval of the adjournment proposal require the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the "golden parachute
compensation" and adjournment proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of each of the "golden parachute compensation" proposal and the adjournment
proposal. The vote with respect to the "golden parachute compensation" is merely an advisory vote and will not be binding on the Company or Parent. Accordingly, regardless of
the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote, if the merger agreement is adopted by the shareholders and completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the
various "golden parachute" payments.

Table of Contents

        If a shareholder's shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee and the shareholder wishes to vote at the Special Meeting, the shareholder must obtain from
the record holder a proxy issued in the shareholder's name. Brokers who hold shares in "street name" for clients typically have the authority to vote on "routine" proposals when
they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. Absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, however, brokers are not allowed to exercise
their voting discretion with respect to the approval of non-routine matters, such as the merger agreement. Proxies submitted without a vote by brokers on these matters are
referred to as "broker non-votes." Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists at the Special Meeting.

How Many Votes Are Needed to Approve Each Proposal? 

• For Proposal 1, the adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of (i) a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company
Common Stock entitled to vote thereon as of the record date for the Special Meeting; and (ii) a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock
entitled to vote thereon as of the record date for the Special Meeting that are not owned by: (x) officers or directors of the Company, (y) the Rollover Investors, or
(z) any person having any equity interest in Parent or Merger Sub. Because adoption of the merger agreement requires the approval of shareholders representing a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, failure to vote your shares of Company Common Stock (including failure to provide voting
instructions if you hold through a broker, bank or other nominee) will have exactly the same effect as a vote AGAINST the merger agreement. 

• For Proposal 2, the vote to approve the "golden parachute compensation," the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present or represented and
entitled to vote either in person or by proxy is required. However, the vote on Proposal 2 is advisory only and will not be binding on the Company or Parent and is
not a condition to the consummation of the merger. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote, if the merger agreement is adopted
by the shareholders and completed, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the various "golden parachute" payments. Abstentions will have the
same effect as a vote AGAINST the "golden parachute compensation" proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote to approve the "golden
parachute compensation." 

• For Proposal 3, the vote to adjourn the Special Meeting if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares present or represented and entitled to vote either in person or by proxy is required. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
AGAINST the adjournment proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote to approve the adjournment proposal. The persons named as proxies may
propose and vote for one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting, including adjournments to permit further solicitations of proxies.

        The Rollover Investors have entered into a separate voting agreement with Parent and the Company that covers an aggregate of approximately 19.8% of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, pursuant to which such shareholders have agreed to vote their shares FOR the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
merger and any related proposal in furtherance of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

What Should I Do With My Stock Certificates at this Time? 

        Please do not send in stock certificates at this time.    If the merger is completed, you will be sent a letter of transmittal regarding the procedures for exchanging the
existing Company's stock certificates for the payment of $27.50 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

How Many Shares Must Be Present to Constitute a Quorum for the Special Meeting? 

        A quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present at the Special Meeting if at least a majority of votes represented by the holders of
our outstanding Company Common Stock is present in person or represented by proxy. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date, August 16, 2018,
are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting or any adjournment, postponement or recess thereof. As of the close of business on August 16, 2018, there
were outstanding 15,884,250 shares of Company Common Stock.

        Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you vote in person at the Special Meeting or if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your
broker, bank or other agent). Abstentions and broker non-votes will also be counted towards the quorum requirement.

Stock Ownership and Interests of Certain Persons 

        Our directors and executive officers have informed us that, as of the date of this Proxy Statement, they intend to vote all of the shares of Company Common Stock owned
directly by them in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of August 16, 2018, the record date for the Special Meeting, our directors and executive officers directly
owned, in the aggregate, 3,291,772 shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, or collectively approximately 20.7% of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Certain of our directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, those
of the Company's shareholders generally. As of August 16, 2018, the record date for the Special Meeting, our directors and executive officers that are not party to the voting
agreement (as described in "Special Factors—Voting Agreement" beginning on page 91) directly owned, in the aggregate, 351,580 shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting, or collectively approximately 2.2% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. For more
information, please see "Special Factors—Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 83, "Special Factors—Financing of the
Merger—Rollover Commitments" beginning on page 82.

        As of August 16, 2018, the record date for the Special Meeting, the Rollover Investors owned 3,266,265 shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting, or approximately 20.6%, of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. The Rollover Investors have entered into a
voting agreement with Parent and the Company pursuant to which, unless the voting agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms (including upon a termination of the
merger agreement in accordance with its terms), such shareholders have agreed to, among other things, vote, or cause to be voted, their shares of Company Common Stock in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and any related proposal in furtherance of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. See "Special
Factors—Voting Agreement" beginning on page 91. The Rollover Investors have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company's
other shareholders. For more information, please see "Special Factors—Financing of the Merger—Rollover Commitments" beginning on page 82.

Expenses of Proxy Solicitation 

        The Company will pay for the entire cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to the costs of mailing the proxy materials and posting the proxy materials on the Internet, the
Company's directors and employees also may solicit proxies in person, by telephone or by other means of communication. Directors and employees will not be paid any
additional compensation for soliciting proxies. The Company also may reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial
owners. Innisfree M&A Incorporated has been retained by the Company to assist it in the solicitation of proxies, using the means referred to above, and will receive a fee of

approximately $25,000. The Company will reimburse Innisfree M&A Incorporated for reasonable expenses and costs incurred by it in connection with its services and will
indemnify Innisfree M&A Incorporated for certain losses.

Adjournments, Postponements and Recesses 

        Although the Company does not expect to do so, if the Company has not received sufficient proxies to constitute a quorum or sufficient votes for the adoption of the merger
agreement, the Special Meeting may be adjourned, postponed or recessed for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. The proposal to approve the adjournment,
postponement or recess of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
Company Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. Any signed proxies received by the Company that approve
the proposal to adjourn, postpone or recess the Special Meeting will be voted in favor of an adjournment or postponement in these circumstances. Any adjournment,
postponement or recess of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies will allow shareholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at
any time prior to their use.

Rights of Shareholders Who Object to the Merger 

        Shareholders are entitled to statutory appraisal rights under the FBCA in connection with the merger. This means that holders of Company Common Stock who do not vote
in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement may be entitled to have the value of their shares determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in Miami-Dade County,
Florida, and to receive payment based on that valuation instead of receiving the $27.50 per share merger consideration. The ultimate amount received in an appraisal proceeding
may be more than, the same as or less than the amount that would have been received under the merger agreement.

        Shareholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement may exercise their right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of Company
Common Stock as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in Miami-Dade County, Florida if the merger is completed in lieu of receiving the per share merger
consideration, but only if they do not vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement and otherwise comply with the procedures of Sections 607.1301 through 607.1333 of the
FBCA, which is the appraisal rights statute applicable to Florida corporations. A copy of Sections 607.1301 through 607.1333 of the FBCA is included as Appendix C to this
Proxy Statement and the procedures are summarized in this Proxy Statement. See "Special Factors—Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 92 and Appendix C to this Proxy
Statement.

Other Matters 

        The board of directors is not aware of any business to be brought before the Special Meeting other than that described in this Proxy Statement. If, however, other matters are
properly presented at the Special Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their best judgment with respect to those matters.

card, you should contact Innisfree M&A Incorporated, our proxy solicitor, by calling toll-free at 1 (888) 750-5834 (banks and brokers may call collect at (212) 750-5833).

of specific dates. The statements embodied in those representations and warranties were made for purposes of that contract between the parties and are subject to qualifications
and limitations agreed by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of that contract. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the
merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purposes of
establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to close the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove
to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the merger agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. Furthermore,
some of those representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any particular date because they are subject to a contractual standard of materiality different
from that generally applicable to public disclosures to shareholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by disclosures that were made
by each party to the other, which disclosures are not reflected in the merger agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and
warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this Proxy Statement, may have changed since the date of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or
new information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been included in this Proxy Statement. The merger agreement is described in, and included as Appendix A to,
this Proxy Statement only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions and not to provide any factual information regarding the Company, Parent or the
Company's or Parent's respective businesses. The representations and warranties in the merger agreement and the description of them in this document should not be read alone,
but instead should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in the reports, statements and filings the Company publicly files with the SEC.

General; The Merger 

        The merger agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company upon the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth in the merger agreement
and in accordance with the FBCA. After the completion of the merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue its corporate
existence under the FBCA as the surviving corporation in the merger and will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. If the merger is completed, the shares of Company
Common Stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market, will be deregistered under the Exchange Act and will no longer be publicly traded, and the Company will no
longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to the Company Common Stock. The Company will be a privately held corporation and the Company's
current shareholders (other than the Rollover Investors) will cease to have any ownership interest in the Company or rights as the

Company's shareholders. Therefore, following the completion of the merger, the Company's current shareholders (other than the Rollover Investors) will not participate in any of
the Company's future earnings or growth and will not benefit from any appreciation in the Company's value, if any.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger 

        Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement, the closing of the merger will take place (a) on the second business
day after the day on which the conditions to closing set forth in the merger agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) are satisfied or waived or (b) at such other time as Parent and the Company may agree in writing.

        If the merger is not consummated by December 14, 2018, the Company or Parent may terminate the merger agreement, except such right to terminate the merger agreement
will not be available to such party if such party has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the merger agreement, which breach has materially
contributed to, or resulted in, the failure to consummate the merger by such date.

        The effective time of the merger will occur upon the filing of the articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida (or at such later date as the Company
and Parent may agree and specify in the articles of merger) in accordance with the FBCA.

Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws 

        At the effective time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company will be amended and restated in their entirety in the form agreed to by the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub, until amended in accordance with their terms or by applicable law.

Conversion of Securities 

Common Stock

        Except for (i) shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries, (ii) shares of Company
Common Stock held by the Rollover Investors, and (iii) shares of Company Common Stock whose holders have not voted in favor of adopting the merger agreement and have
demanded and perfected their appraisal rights in accordance with, and have complied in all respects with, the FBCA ((i) through (iii) collectively, the "excluded shares"), each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into the right to receive $27.50 in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes. At the effective time of the merger, each share of Company Common
Stock theretofore issued and outstanding will be cancelled automatically and cease to exist.

Treatment of Outstanding Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock Awards

        Unless otherwise agreed upon between Parent and any applicable stock option or stock appreciation right holder, at the effective time of the merger, each option to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock and each stock appreciation right under the Company's equity plan, outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, whether
or not then vested or exercisable, by virtue of the merger, will be canceled and each stock option and stock appreciation right will be converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the per share exercise or purchase price of the applicable stock option or stock appreciation
right at the time of calculation multiplied by the aggregate number of

shares of Company Common Stock that may be acquired upon exercise of such stock option or stock appreciation right.

        Unless otherwise agreed upon between Parent and any restricted common stock holder, at the effective time of the merger, each share of restricted common stock that vests
solely based on continued service outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, by virtue of the merger will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration
per share of restricted common stock, except that each share of restricted common stock that vests solely based on continued service held by a non-employee member of the
board of directors will, prior to such conversion, be prorated based on the number of days since the date of grant.

        Unless otherwise agreed upon between Parent and restricted stock holder, each restricted stock award that vests based on the achievement of performance goals outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time, by virtue of the merger, will be converted at the effective time into the right to receive a restricted cash award on the same terms and
conditions (including applicable time and/or service vesting conditions but excluding performance goals) applicable to such restricted stock award under the applicable Company
equity plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the effective time, with respect to an amount of cash determined by multiplying the per share merger
consideration by the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would vest based on the achievement of any applicable performance goals at the target level. For the
avoidance of doubt, any provisions relating to the forfeiture, acceleration of vesting or payment of any award contained in a restricted stock award that vests based on the
achievement of performance goals will apply to the restricted cash award; provided that, in the event any such restricted stock award does not contain such an acceleration
provision, such restricted cash award will vest and be paid upon the termination of the holder's employment by the Company without cause or by the holder for good reason
(each, as defined in the most recent Company equity plan), in each case, subject to the execution and delivery (without revocation) of a release of claims in favor of the Company
in the form provided by the Company. Moreover, each restricted stock award subject to any performance-based vesting condition held by Mr. Jorge Narino or Ms. Tricia
McDermott Thompkins will be converted into a right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of: (a) the per share merger consideration and (b) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock award that would have vested based on target level achievement.

        All restricted stock units (including those held by George Feldenkreis) payable in shares of Company Common Stock or whose value is determined with reference to the
value of shares of Company Common Stock will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger.

Payment Procedures 

        No less than three business days before the effective time of the merger, Parent will select a bank or trust company, satisfactory to the Company in its reasonable discretion,
to act as the paying agent in the merger and will enter into a paying agent agreement with the paying agent, the terms and conditions of which shall be satisfactory to the
Company in its reasonable discretion. Parent will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the paying agent. Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, Parent will
deposit or cause to be deposited with the paying agent sufficient funds to pay the per share merger consideration for all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (other than the excluded shares) entitled to payment thereof and to pay the amounts described above to holders of stock options, certain restricted stock awards and
restricted stock units. At the effective time of the merger, Parent will cause the paying agent to mail a letter of transmittal in the paying agent's standard form (and reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Company) and instructions to each holder of record of Company Common Stock. The letter of transmittal and instructions will tell such holder:
(i) that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such holder's shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such holder's stock certificates (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) to the

paying agent or, in the case of book-entry shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal and (ii) instructions for surrendering such certificates or
book-entry shares (if the holder's shares are not certificated) in exchange for the merger consideration. Such instructions will provide that: (A) at the election of the holder, stock
certificates may be surrendered by hand delivery or otherwise and (B) the merger consideration payable in exchange for the stock certificates and/or book-entry shares will be
payable by wire transfer to the surrendering holder.

        You should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock certificates to the paying agent without a letter
of transmittal.

        You will not be entitled to receive the merger consideration until you surrender your stock certificate or certificates (if your shares are certificated) (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) to the paying agent, together with a duly completed and executed letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by the paying agent. The merger
consideration may be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the corresponding stock certificate is registered if (i) the surrendered stock certificate is accompanied
by all documents required by Parent to evidence and effect that transfer and (ii) the person requesting such payment pays any applicable transfer taxes or other taxes required by
reason of payment of the merger consideration to a person other than the registered holder or establishes to the satisfaction of Parent and the paying agent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable.

        No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of the stock certificates. Parent, Merger Sub, the surviving corporation and the paying agent will
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable under the merger agreement as may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the payment
of such consideration under the Code, or any applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to the appropriate
taxing authorities, those amounts will be treated as having been paid to the person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made for all purposes under the merger
agreement.

        None of Parent, the surviving corporation or the paying agent will be liable to any holder of stock certificates or book-entry shares for any amount properly paid to a public
official under any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

        The paying agent will invest the payment fund as directed by Parent, provided, that such investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States, in
commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the law of a state of the United States, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's
Ratings Service, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10.0 billion, or in
mutual funds investing solely in such assets. Any such investment will be for the benefit, and at the risk, of Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from such
investment will be for the benefit of Parent; provided, however, no such investment or losses thereon will affect the merger consideration payable to the holders of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and Parent will promptly provide, or will cause the surviving corporation to promptly provide, additional
funds to the paying agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, stock options, performance stock awards and restricted stock awards immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger in the amount of any such losses to the extent necessary to satisfy the obligations of Parent and the surviving corporation in connection with the
merger.

        Any portion of the payment fund which remains unclaimed by former shareholders of the Company one year after the effective time of the merger will be delivered by the
paying agent to Parent upon demand, and any former shareholders who have not surrendered their shares in exchange for the merger consideration will thereafter look only to
Parent and/or the surviving corporation for payment of the merger consideration.

Representations and Warranties 

        The representations and warranties of the Company contained in the merger agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties thereto and are solely for the
benefit of Parent and Merger Sub. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties to the merger agreement and are qualified by a
confidential disclosure letter containing non-public information and made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties instead of establishing these matters
as facts. Consequently, the Company's representations and warranties in the merger agreement may not be relied upon by persons other than the parties thereto as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of the merger agreement or as of any other date, nor may you rely upon them in making the decision to approve
and authorize the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The merger agreement may only be enforced against the Company by Parent and
Merger Sub. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties of the Company may change after the date of the merger agreement,
which subsequent information may or may not be reflected fully in the Company's public disclosures.

authorizations, as a result of the Company entering into and performing under the merger agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement;

• the vote of the majority of the Company's shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting as a single class, is the only vote necessary to adopt the merger agreement;

agreement;

        Many of the Company's representations and warranties are qualified by the absence of a "Company Material Adverse Effect," which means, for purposes of the merger
agreement, any fact, circumstance, change, event, development, occurrence or effect that has, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets or results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a "Company Material Adverse Effect" does not include such effects relating to or arising from:

• any national, international, or any foreign or domestic regional economic, financial, social or political conditions (including changes therein), including the results
of any primary or general elections; 

• changes in any financial, debt, credit, capital or banking markets or conditions (including any disruption thereof);

Material Adverse Effect has occurred);

• the occurrence, escalation, outbreak or worsening of any hostilities, war, police action, acts of terrorism or military conflicts;

• compliance by the Company and its subsidiaries with the terms of the merger agreement (other than the conduct of their operations in the ordinary course

        The merger agreement also contains various representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company that are subject, in some cases, to specified

        The Company has various obligations and responsibilities under the merger agreement from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger,
including, but not limited to, the following:

Conduct of Business Pending the Merger

        During the period between the date of the merger agreement and the earlier of the effective time of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement, except as

consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the Company has agreed to, and has agreed to cause each of its subsidiaries to, conduct its operations only in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice, and to use its reasonable best efforts to preserve substantially intact the business organization of the Company and its
subsidiaries, to keep available the services of the current officers, employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries, and to preserve, in all material respects, the

• authorize, commit or agree to do any of the foregoing.

        Any or all actions taken by, or omissions of, the Company, in an effort to satisfy or facilitate the Financing Contingencies will not constitute a breach of the Company's
obligations under these provisions (including for purposes of the Parent's termination rights and the Company's financing cooperation covenants), and any or all action taken by,
or omission of, the Company in breach of these provisions at the direction of or with the consent of Oscar Feldenkreis, in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer of the Company,
or which Oscar Feldenkreis, in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, had prior or contemporaneous knowledge of or reasonably should have had prior or
contemporaneous knowledge of, shall in each case be disregarded and not deemed to be a breach of these provisions (including for purposes of the Parent's termination rights and
the Company's financing cooperation covenants). In this context "Financing Contingencies" means (i) the "Excess Availability" requirement described in clause (d) of Exhibit C
of the Wells Commitment Letter; (ii) (x) the "Reorganization" as defined in the Wells Commitment Letter, and (y) the "Reorganization" as defined in the Fortress Commitment
Letter; and (iii) the approval of the "Agent" and initial "Lenders" (in each case as defined in the Wells Commitment Letter or Fortress Commitment Letter, as applicable) under
each of the Wells Commitment Letter and the Fortress Commitment Letter of the form and substance of (x) the intercompany license agreement relating to the intellectual
property, and (y) the intercompany lease agreement relating to the leasing of property of the Company.

Access to Information

        The Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, (i) provide to Parent and its representatives access at reasonable times upon prior notice to the officers, employees,
properties, auditors, authorized representatives, books and records of the Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) furnish promptly such information concerning the Company and
its subsidiaries as Parent or its representatives may reasonably request. Nothing in the merger agreement shall require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to grant such access
if the Company determines that such access would reasonably be expected to disrupt or impair the business or operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or disclose
information to the extent such disclosure would, in the Company's good faith opinion after consultation with legal counsel, (A) result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or similar privilege or (B) violate any applicable law or any confidentiality obligation of such party. In the event that the Company does not provide access
or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it must provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access or information and the Company must use its reasonable
best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate the applicable law, contract or obligation or risk waiver of such
privilege. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company must comply with and cause their respective representatives to comply with the obligations under the
confidentiality agreements, dated March 15, 2018, between each of George Feldenkreis and Fortress Investment Group, LLC, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand with respect to the foregoing information, provided that Parent may provide such information to potential sources of capital and to rating agencies and prospective lenders
and investors during syndication of the debt financing, subject to customary confidentiality agreements that have been approved in advance by the Company (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

agreement, the Company must not, and must cause its subsidiaries and direct its representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of providing material non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a takeover proposal (as defined immediately below); 

• enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person regarding a takeover proposal (other than to state that the Company is not permitted to
have discussions or negotiations); or 

• approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any contract with respect to, a takeover proposal (other than an acceptable
confidentiality agreement).

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining shareholder approval for the adoption of the merger agreement, following the Company's receipt of a takeover
proposal, the Special Committee and the board of directors are permitted to participate in discussions regarding such takeover proposal solely to clarify the terms thereof, and,
with respect to a written, bona fide takeover proposal that was not the result of a breach in any material respect of the "no-shop" provisions in the merger agreement, if the
Special Committee or the board of directors determines in good faith (i) after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors that a takeover proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal (as defined below) and (ii) after consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to take the actions set forth in
clauses (A) and (B) below with respect to such takeover proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to shareholders under applicable law,
then the Company may, in response to such takeover proposal, (A) furnish access and non-public information with respect to the Company and any of its subsidiaries to the
person who has made such takeover proposal pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, which means on terms no less favorable (except with respect to standstill
provisions to the extent required to permit submission of a takeover proposal) in the aggregate to the Company than the confidentiality agreements, dated March 15, 2018,
between each of George Feldenkreis and Fortress Investment Group, LLC, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, so long as any written non-public information
provided under clause (A) has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent promptly after being provided to such person, and (B) participate in discussions and
negotiations regarding such takeover proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the merger agreement, the Special Committee and the board of directors shall be
permitted, to the extent it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties, to modify, waive, amend or release any existing standstill obligations owed by any Person (as defined in the merger agreement) to the Company or any
of its subsidiaries.

        A "takeover proposal" is defined in the merger agreement to mean any bona fide written proposal or offer relating to:

• a merger, consolidation, spin-off, share exchange (including a split-off) or business combination involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries representing
20% or more of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; 

• a sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, transfer or other disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of 20% or more of the assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

• a purchase or sale of shares of capital stock or other securities, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, representing 20% or more of the voting
power of the capital stock of the Company, including by way of a tender offer or exchange offer; 

• a reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution of the Company involving 20% or more of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; or 

• any other transaction having a similar effect to those described in the foregoing.

        A "superior proposal" is defined in the merger agreement to mean any bona fide written takeover proposal (with the percentages in the definition of such term changed from
20% to 50%), not obtained in violation of the "no-shop" provisions of the merger agreement, which the Special Committee has determined in good faith, after consultation with
the Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisors:

• is on terms and conditions more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of the Company (excluding the Rollover Investors) than those
contemplated by the merger agreement; and 

• is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all material financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of the proposal.

        The Company must advise Parent orally and in writing of any of the following within one business day of receipt thereof (but not including the date of the Company's
receipt thereof): (i) any takeover proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such takeover proposal and the identity of the party making such takeover proposal and
(ii) any material modifications to the financial or other material terms and conditions of such takeover proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current
basis with respect to the status and material terms of any such takeover proposal.

        Except as described below, the Special Committee and the board of directors may not: (i) withdraw, modify or amend (or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or amend) its
recommendation that the Company's shareholders adopt the merger agreement in any manner adverse to Parent, (ii) approve, endorse or recommend (or publicly propose to do
so) a takeover proposal or (iii) approve, recommend or allow the Company to enter into a contract relating to a takeover proposal (other than acceptable confidentiality
agreements).

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by the Company's shareholders, the Special Committee or the board of directors
may, in response to a superior proposal received by the Special Committee or the board of directors after the date of the merger agreement, if the Special Committee or the board
of directors concludes in good faith, following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that its failure to withdraw, modify or amend its recommendation would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, withdraw, modify or amend its recommendation or terminate the merger agreement, upon payment of a termination fee
(described below), to enter into a contract with respect to such superior proposal, but only if:

• the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under the "no shop" restrictions contained in the merger agreement; 

• the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to terminate the merger agreement and enter into a contract with respect to a
superior proposal. Such notice must include the material terms and conditions of the transaction that constitutes such superior proposal and the identity of the
party making such superior proposal, and to the extent provided to the Company, a copy of any material contract evidencing or relating to the superior proposal (a
"notice of superior proposal"); and

• Parent does not make within four business days of delivery of a notice of superior proposal (with any material change to the financial or other terms and
conditions of such superior proposal requiring an additional notice to Parent and an additional two business day period) a proposal that the Special Committee or
the board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor, causes the superior proposal described in the applicable notice of
superior proposal to no longer constitute a superior proposal. In addition, during the four business day period after a notice of superior proposal is provided to
Parent (or the two business day period after an additional notice of any material change to the terms and conditions of a superior proposal is provided to Parent),
the Company must, and must cause its representatives, to negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make adjustments to the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement such that the superior proposal contained in the notice of superior proposal ceases to constitute a superior proposal.

        Nothing contained in the merger agreement prohibits the Special Committee or the board of directors, at any time prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by the
Company's shareholders, if any event, fact, development, circumstance or occurrence (but specifically excluding any takeover proposal or superior proposal) that improves the
business, assets, operations or prospects of the Company or its subsidiaries (or that fundamentally impairs Parent's ability to consummate the merger on the terms set forth in the
merger agreement) that was not known (and, other than with respect to Parent, should not reasonably have been known) to the Special Committee and the board of directors
(other than George Feldenkreis and Oscar Feldenkreis) as of the date of the merger agreement (an "intervening event"), becomes known to the Special Committee and the board
of directors (other than George Feldenkreis and Oscar Feldenkreis) after the date of the merger agreement, from withdrawing, modifying or amending its recommendation that
the Company's shareholders adopt the merger agreement in a manner adverse to Parent if the board of directors has determined in good faith, following consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that its failure to withdraw, modify or amend its recommendation that the Company's shareholders adopt the merger agreement would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable law, but only if:

• the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that the Special Committee or the board of directors intends to withdraw, modify or amend its
recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, which notice shall include a description in reasonable detail of the intervening event and the board of director's
reasons for taking such action; and 

• Parent does not, within four business days after the receipt of such notice, propose revisions to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement in response to
such intervening event that the Special Committee or the board of directors determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
obviate the need for the Special Committee or the board of directors to withdraw, modify or amend its recommendation, and the Company (acting through the
Special Committee) shall, and shall cause its representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such period
with respect to such proposed revisions.

        Nothing contained in the merger agreement prohibits the Company from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making
required disclosure to the Company's shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Special Committee or the board of directors, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law or disclosure is required under applicable law.

Proxy Statement; Schedule 13E-3

        The merger agreement requires, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of the merger agreement, the Company to prepare and file with the SEC a
preliminary Proxy Statement and the Company and Parent to jointly prepare and file with the SEC a transaction statement pursuant to Rule 13E-3 under the Exchange Act on
Schedule 13E-3. The Company must use its reasonable best efforts as promptly as reasonably practicable (and after consultation with Parent) to respond to any comments or
requests for additional information from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and the Company and Parent must use reasonable best efforts as promptly as reasonably
practicable to jointly respond to any comments or requests for additional information made by the SEC with respect to the Schedule 13E-3. The Company must use reasonable
best efforts to cause this Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after confirmation from the SEC that it has no further
comments on this Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 (or that this Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 is otherwise not to be reviewed by the SEC). Parent and Merger
Sub are obligated to cooperate with the Company in the preparation of this Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the merger
agreement requires (i) each of Parent and Merger Sub to furnish to the Company the information relating to it and its affiliates required by the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in this Proxy Statement that is customarily included in proxy statements or Rule 13E-3 transaction statements on
Schedule 13E-3 prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated by the merger agreement or that is reasonably requested by the Company, and (ii) prior to the
filing with the SEC or the mailing to the Company's shareholders of this Proxy Statement or the filing with the SEC of the Schedule 13E-3, the Company to provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on, and the Company to reasonably consider all comments reasonably proposed by Parent with respect to, this Proxy Statement
and the Schedule 13E-3. The Company must promptly (A) notify Parent upon the receipt of any such comments or requests and (B) provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, to the extent such correspondence relates to this
Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3.

        The Company will establish a record date for purposes of determining the shareholders entitled to notice of and vote at the shareholders meeting. Following the clearance by
the SEC of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, the Company will call and hold the Company shareholders meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable for the
purpose of obtaining the shareholder's approval of the merger agreement.

Covenants of Parent and/or Merger Sub 

Conduct of Business During Merger

        Parent must not, and must not permit any of its affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) take or agree to take any action that would reasonably be expected to (i) delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, (ii) impose or cause any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any governmental authorization necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement or the expiration or termination of any waiting period under applicable law, (iii) result in any governmental authority entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or (iv) materially interfere with Parent's (or its affiliates') ability to make available to the
paying agent at the effective time of the merger funds sufficient to satisfy all of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations under the merger agreement including the payment by
Parent and Merger Sub of the merger consideration, any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the surviving corporation, and any related repayment or
refinancing of any indebtedness of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and any other amounts

required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Employee Matters

        The merger agreement requires Parent to, or to cause the surviving corporation to, for one year following the merger, provide to individuals who, immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, were employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (i) a salary or hourly wage rate and short-term (annual or more frequent) bonus or
commission opportunity no less favorable than that provided to such employee immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and (ii) other compensation and benefits (but
not including equity and equity-based awards) that for such individual are substantially comparable in the aggregate to such compensation and benefits being provided to
Company employees immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. For any employee who is terminated within the later of one year after the merger or the remaining
term of any individual employment, severance or separation agreement in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger under circumstances that would have given
the employee a right to severance payments and benefits under the Company's severance arrangements in effect immediately prior to the merger, the Company will provide such
employee with severance payments and benefits no less favorable than those that would have been provided to the employee under the Company's severance arrangements.
Additionally, Parent will, or will cause the surviving corporation to recognize service with the Company prior to the effective time of the merger for purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and for calculating severance and vacation entitlements (which will exclude benefit accruals under any qualified or non-qualified defined benefit pension
plan). Parent will use reasonable best efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations to the extent waived or satisfied under the
Company's existing plans and give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts
reimbursed to, employees under similar plans maintained by the Company immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. The merger agreement requires Parent to, or to
cause the surviving corporation to (i) allow employees to use their accrued but unused vacation time pursuant to the terms of Parent's or the surviving corporation's vacation
policy, as in effect from time to time and (ii) if any employee's employment terminates within one year following the merger under circumstances entitling the employee to
severance pay under a severance policy or arrangement, pay the employee, in cash, an amount equal to the value of the accrued vacation time. However, the merger agreement
does not create any right to any compensation or benefits, guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude Parent or surviving corporation from terminating any
employee, require continuation of any employee benefit plan or otherwise constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan. The agreements and obligations with respect to
employee-related matters described in this paragraph do not give any employee or any other person who is not expressly a party to the merger agreement any rights as a third
party beneficiary or otherwise under the merger agreement.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Directors' and Officers' Insurance

        Parent has agreed to maintain, and to cause the surviving corporation to maintain for at least six years following the effective time of the merger the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the effective time of the merger (including in connection with the negotiation
and execution of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby). Such policies shall not have an annual premium in excess of 250% of
the renewal premium being paid by the Company in connection with its June 2018 renewal. In lieu of Parent purchasing such policy after the effective time of the merger, the
Company may, prior to the effective time of the merger, purchase a "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance policy covering

Table of Contents

the aforementioned matters at a cost not to exceed 250% of the renewal premium paid by the Company in connection with its June 2018 renewal and if the Company purchases
such a policy prior to the effective time of the merger, Parent and the surviving corporation shall maintain such policy for six years.

        In addition, for a period of six years after the effective time of the merger, Parent and the surviving corporation have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries against all costs or expenses (including legal fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action, arbitration, litigation, suit or other civil or criminal proceeding or governmental
investigation, including liabilities arising out of or relating to all acts and omissions arising out of or relating to their services as directors or officers and employees of the
Company or its subsidiaries occurring prior to the effective time, whether asserted or claimed before or after the effective time of the merger.

Agreements with Principal Shareholders

        Parent and Merger Sub have agreed that following the date of the merger agreement and until the adoption of the merger agreement by the Company's shareholders, neither
of them nor their respective affiliates will enter into any agreement with any of the Rollover Investors or any of their respective affiliates relating to the merger or the business,
operations or other interests of the Company and its subsidiaries after the effective time of the merger unless the agreement shall terminate upon the termination of the merger
agreement without payment or penalty or any further obligations. Parent and Merger Sub have also agreed that following the date of the merger agreement and until the adoption
of the merger agreement by the Company's shareholders, Parent will not amend, or waive any requirement under, the voting agreement or the Rollover Letters without the prior
written consent of the Company.

Certain Covenants of Each Party 

Reasonable Best Efforts

        Under the merger agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub is obligated to, and to cause its affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that the conditions to the parties' respective obligations to consummate the
merger are satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated by merger agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable; provided that prior to the effective time, in no
event will the Company or any of its subsidiaries be required to pay or otherwise incur any liability with respect to any fees (except for customary fees to governmental
authorities), penalties or other consideration to obtain any consent or approval required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Approvals and Consents

        The parties have agreed to cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all required consents, approvals or other authorizations, including,
without limitation, all consents of governmental entities and certain other consents required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Filings and Authorizations

        The Company and Parent have agreed to cooperate and consult with each other in connection with making required filings and notifications pursuant to the Securities Act of
1933 and the Exchange Act, the HSR Act and any other applicable foreign competition law, the FBCA, the rules and regulations of

the Nasdaq Global Market and any other applicable laws, including by providing copies of all relevant documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing. In
addition, each of the Company and Parent have agreed to take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable (consistent with their obligations to obtain the
necessary governmental authorizations under the merger agreement) to cause the expiration of the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required consents, approvals or
authorizations, as applicable, under the laws described in the preceding sentence as soon as reasonably practicable, including by (i) selling, licensing, divesting or disposing of or
holding separate any entities, assets, intellectual property or businesses (including, after the effective time, the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries), (ii) terminating,
amending or assigning existing relationships or contractual rights and obligations, (iii) changing or modifying any course of conduct regarding future operations, (iv) otherwise
taking actions that would limit its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of their respective businesses, assets or rights or interests therein and
(v) committing to take any such actions in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) (all of the foregoing a "divestiture action"); provided that neither Parent nor its affiliates shall
be required to, and the Company and its subsidiaries shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, take or agree to take or commit to take any divestiture action with
respect to any assets (whether tangible or intangible) that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined
in the merger agreement) (with references to the Company in the definition thereof also being deemed to be references to Parent for purposes of such Section).

        None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company may consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the transactions expressly contemplated by the merger agreement at the request of any governmental entity without the consent of the other parties, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Transaction Litigation

        The merger agreement provides that, prior to the earlier of the effective time or the termination of the merger agreement, the Company shall control the defense of any legal
action (including any class action or derivative litigation) relating directly or indirectly to the merger agreement or transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including
disclosures made under securities laws and regulations related thereto ("transaction litigation"); provided, however, that the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable
after obtaining knowledge thereof, notify Parent in writing of, and shall (i) give Parent the right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any transaction litigation (and the Company shall in good faith take such comments into account), and the opportunity to participate in the defense
and settlement of, any transaction litigation and (ii) if Parent does not exercise such right to participate (subject to the Company's control right), keep Parent reasonably and
promptly informed with respect to the status of such transaction litigation. Except as permitted by the confidential Company disclosure letter, no compromise or settlement of any
transaction litigation shall be agreed to by the Company without Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Public Announcements

        The merger agreement requires that the Company and Parent must consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, except that no such consultation is necessary: (i) to the extent disclosure may be required by applicable
law or any Nasdaq Global Market requirement, in which case that party must use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such release or
making any such public statement, (ii) in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, and may make internal announcements
to employees, to the extent that such statements are not inconsistent with previous

press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the parties and otherwise in compliance with these provisions and do not reveal material non-public
information regarding the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or (iii) in connection with any press release or other public statement or
comment to be issued or made with respect to any takeover proposal or certain other actions specified in the "no-shop" provisions of the merger agreement. Additionally, the
Company may (i) communicate with customers, vendors, suppliers, financial analysts, investors and media representatives in a manner consistent with its past practice in
compliance with applicable law, and (ii) make public statements consistent with prior public disclosures previously approved by Parent for external distribution.

Financing

        The merger agreement requires each of Parent and Merger Sub, and requires them to cause each of their respective affiliates, to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (reflecting the flex provisions to the extent necessary) on the date of the closing of the merger and to consummate
the Rollover Investment in accordance with the terms of the Rollover Letters, including, among other things, complying with the terms of each such commitment letter and the
Rollover Letters applicable to them, entering into definitive financing agreements that are no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters (or on terms and conditions otherwise acceptable to Parent that would not (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the financing unless the Rollover Investment
is increased by a corresponding amount or (y) impose new or additional conditions precedent to, or delay, the receipt of such financing), satisfying on a timely basis all applicable
conditions under the Debt Commitment Letters and Rollover Letters and consummating the financing and the Rollover Investment at or prior to the closing of the merger.
Further, Parent is required to keep the Company regularly informed with respect to the debt financing, including providing copies of all definitive documents related to such
financing, as well as the Rollover Investment. Further, Parent and Merger Sub must provide the Company with prompt notice of any material breach or default by any party to
any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Rollover Letters or definitive agreements related to the financing of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware. In the event that any
portion of the financing becomes unavailable and such portion is not otherwise available under the debt financing or Rollover Investment (as applicable), Parent will notify the
Company and use its reasonable best efforts to arrange alternative financing from the same or other sources of financing on terms and conditions (including the economic terms,
covenants, flex provisions and funding conditions) no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub, taken as a whole, than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (taking
into account the flex provisions) as of the date of the merger agreement, and in an amount sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the merger on the alternative conditions.

        Prior to the closing of the merger, Parent may not, without the prior written consent of the Company, amend, modify, supplement or waive any of the conditions or
contingencies to funding contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (or definitive agreements related thereto) or the Rollover Letters, the effect of which (i) reduces (or could
have the effect of reducing) the amount of aggregate cash proceeds available from the financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount
other than as a result of the exercise of any related "market flex" provisions) unless there is a corresponding increase in the Rollover Investment, (ii) imposes, or could reasonably
be expected to impose, new or additional conditions or contingencies to the receipt of the financing or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other material provision of any
financing commitment, (iii) would delay, prevent or adversely impact, or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of delaying, preventing or adversely impacting, in each
case, in any material respect, the funding of the financing on the closing date of the merger agreement, or (iv) would prevent or adversely impact or delay, or, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing, adversely impacting, or delaying, in each case, in any material respect the ability of Parent

the Company, including by granting such financing sources access as provided in the merger agreement (including certain limitations as set forth in the merger
agreement);

to be paid off, discharged and terminated on the closing date of the merger;

amounts with respect thereto incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, shall be paid by Parent.

Specific Performance

specifically the terms and provisions thereof, this being in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity to which they are entitled. However, the right of the Company to seek
specific performance to enforce Parent's and/or Merger Sub's obligation to effect the closing as provided by the merger agreement is subject to the requirements that (i) all of the
conditions to the parties' respective obligations and to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the merger would have been satisfied if the closing were to have
occurred at such time (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied at the closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the closing, or the
failure of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
the merger agreement), (ii) the debt financing has been funded or will be funded at the date the closing is required to occur in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement
upon delivery of a drawdown notice by Parent and/or notice from Parent that the Rollover Investment will be funded at such date, (iii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the

agreement, and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that all of the conditions to the parties' respective obligations and to the Company's obligations
to consummate the merger have been satisfied (or that the Company would be willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions for purposes of consummating the merger) and that if
specific performance is granted and if the debt financing and Rollover Investment were funded, the closing would occur. The merger agreement provides that under no
circumstances may the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to which the merger is consummated
and the aggregate merger consideration is received, on the one hand, and payment of all or a portion of the reverse termination fee or other monetary damages, on the other hand.

Amendment; Extension; Waiver 

        The merger agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before the effective time of the merger, whether before or after obtaining the requisite company vote so
long as (i) no amendment that requires further shareholder approval under applicable law after shareholder adoption of the merger agreement shall be made without such required
further approval and (ii) such amendment has been duly approved by the board of directors or manager, as applicable of each of Merger Sub, Parent and the Company (only
pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Special Committee). The merger agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties to the
merger agreement.

        At any time before the effective time, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company (only pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Special Committee), on the
other hand, may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained in the merger agreement or in any document delivered under the merger agreement, or (iii) subject to applicable law, waive compliance with any of the covenants
or conditions contained in the merger agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
by such party. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under the merger agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege under the merger agreement.

Special Committee Approval 

        No amendment or waiver of any provision of the merger agreement and no decision or determination shall be made, or action taken, by or on behalf of the Company under
or with respect to the merger agreement without first obtaining the approval of the Special Committee.

Breach of Rollover Investors Disregarded 

        Any breach or assertion of any breach of the merger agreement by the Company or any of its representatives that is attributable to or caused by the actions of or failure to act
by George Feldenkreis or Oscar Feldenkreis, including in connection with any representations or warranties made thereunder or any actions taken or failure to act, in each case in
contravention thereof, shall be disregarded for all purposes under the merger agreement.

ADVISORY VOTE ON "GOLDEN PARACHUTE COMPENSATION" 

Golden Parachute Payments 

        This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information regarding the compensation for each of the
Company's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. This
compensation is referred to as "golden parachute" compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the compensation that
may become payable to the Company's named executive officers under existing agreements with the Company in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the merger (the "transaction-related compensation").

        The Company "named executive officers" for purposes of the disclosure in this Proxy Statement are: Oscar Feldenkreis (Chief Executive Officer and President); Jorge
Narino (Interim Chief Financial Officer); Stanley Silverstein (President, International Development and Global Licensing); David Enright (Chief Operating Officer); John F.
Voith, Jr. (President, Golf Division) and George Feldenkreis (Former Executive Chairman).

        To the extent that any of the Company's named executive officers' compensation arrangements are described in "Special Factors—Interests of the Company's Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 83 of this Proxy Statement, they are incorporated herein by reference. The amounts set forth in the table below, which
represent an estimate of each Company named executive officer's golden parachute compensation as of August 31, 2018 calculated in accordance with the SEC's rules on
disclosing golden parachute compensation, assume the following:

• consummation of the merger constitutes a change in control for purposes of the change in control severance plan; 

• the change in control is consummated on August 31, 2018; 

• each Company named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination immediately following the change in control; and 

• the value of the accelerated vesting of the named executive officers' Company equity awards is calculated using the per share merger consideration of $27.50.

        The amounts reported below are estimated based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including the assumptions described above and elsewhere in
this Proxy Statement. As a result, the transaction-related compensation, if any, to be received by a Company named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set
forth below. The amounts in the table below do not include any value received in respect of Company equity awards held by each Company named executive officer that are
vested prior to the consummation of the merger.

Feldenkreis, who was a named executive officer of the Company, ceased being employed by the Company in 2017, and other than the restricted shares
he received in 2018 as a non-employee director that will be rolled over in connection with the consummation of the merger, he holds no unvested
Company equity awards and is not eligible to receive other compensation or benefits in connection with the merger.

(2) The amount listed in this column represents the pre-tax value of the cash amount payable to the Company's named executive officers, including
severance payable pursuant to each named executive officer's employment agreement and the change in control severance plan. 

The cash severance amount is calculated as follows: cash severance is equal to (a) for Mr. Feldenkreis, (i) 200% of the sum of base salary plus target
bonus and (ii) 100% of his annual incentive compensation award based on the achievement of the performance goals with respect to the year in which
the termination occurs (for purposes of this calculation, we assumed achievement of bonuses at the target level), (b) for Messrs. Narino, Enright and
Voith, the sum of 18 months' base salary and a prorated portion of the annual bonus amount for the year of termination of employment based on the
greater of actual or target performance (for purposes of this calculation, we assumed termination on August 31, 2018 and that the prorated bonuses
would be paid assuming target performance achievement), and (c) for Mr. Silverstein, 100% of his base salary.

Cash severance benefits for the named executive officers are "double-trigger" (i.e., they are contingent upon a qualifying termination of employment
that occurs (for Messrs. Narino, Enright and Voith, within 12 months) following the consummation of the merger). As noted above, for
Messrs. Feldenkreis and Silverstein, the severance benefits are not enhanced by the consummation of the merger because it does not constitute a change
in control pursuant to the applicable employment agreement. As a condition of receiving the severance benefits, each Company named executive officer
must execute a release of claims and comply with restrictive covenants applicable to him.

Mr. Feldenkreis's performance-based awards payable in cash will vest based on the actual achievement of the performance goals established under such
arrangement, payable when such performance-based compensation is paid to our other senior executives.

The estimated amount of each component of the cash payment is set forth in the table below, including the target annual bonus and prorated target
annual bonus, as applicable.

Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock Awards" of this Proxy Statement, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate pre-tax
amounts payable to each Company named executive officer in connection with the accelerated vesting of the shares of restricted common stock held by

each share of restricted common stock. Each unvested share of restricted common stock not subject to any performance-based vesting condition held by

Vote Required and Board of Directors Recommendation

        Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act and Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act require that the Company seek an advisory (non-binding) vote from its shareholders to
approve certain "golden parachute compensation" that its "named executive officers" will receive from the Company in connection with the merger. Approval requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal. Accordingly, the Company is asking you to
approve the following resolution:

        "RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the agreements or understandings with and items of compensation payable to the named
executive officers of Perry Ellis International, Inc. that are based on or otherwise relate to the merger with Merger Sub, as disclosed in the section of the Proxy Statement entitled
"Advisory Vote on "Golden Parachute Compensation.""

        The Company's board of directors recommends that shareholders approve the "golden parachute compensation" arrangements described in this Proxy Statement by voting
FOR the above proposal.

        Approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger, and the vote with respect to this proposal is advisory only and will not be binding on the
Company or Parent. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote, if the merger agreement is adopted by the shareholders and completed, our named
executive officers will be eligible to receive the various "golden parachute" payments.

named executive officers vests on a "single-trigger" basis pursuant to the merger agreement. The shares of restricted common stock held by the named
executive officers (other than Mr. Narino) subject to any performance-based vesting condition will be converted into a right to receive a restricted cash
award from the surviving corporation that will vest and be payable (without regard to any performance goals but subject to applicable service vesting
conditions in the prior award) at the end of its currently applicable vesting period, with the cash payment vesting on a "double-trigger" basis upon a
qualifying termination of employment prior to the scheduled vesting date. The shares of restricted common stock subject to any performance-based
vesting conditions held by Mr. Narino vest on a "single-trigger" basis in connection with the consummation of the merger. The equity held by
Mr. Feldenkreis is being rolled over in connection with the consummation of the merger.

(4) Upon a qualifying termination of employment, Perry Ellis is required to provide continued health coverage for 18 months for the named executive
officers other than Mr. Silverstein.

ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

Adjournment of the Special Meeting

        In the event that the number of shares of Company Common Stock present in person and represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and voting FOR the merger is
insufficient to approve the merger proposal, the Company may move to adjourn the Special Meeting in order to enable the board of directors to solicit additional proxies in favor
of the approval of the merger proposal. In that event, the Company will ask its shareholders to vote only upon the adjournment proposal and not on the other proposals discussed
in this Proxy Statement.

Vote Required and Board of Directors Recommendation

        The approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger proposal, requires the affirmative vote of shareholders
holding a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon.

        The board of directors, based in part on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, has unanimously approved and authorized the merger, and recommends
that you vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement and, if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement, recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to
adjourn the Special Meeting.

        The Company's shareholders should obtain a current market quotation for Company Common Stock before making any decision with respect to the merger. On August 16,
2018 (the record date for shareholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting), there were approximately 130 holders of record of Company Common Stock.

        Since its organization, the Company has declared and paid one cash dividend on Company Common Stock, which occurred in December 2012. Accordingly, we do not
expect to declare or pay dividends prior to the merger and, under the terms of the merger agreement, we are prohibited from doing so.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 

        The following table sets forth certain information known to the Company regarding the beneficial ownership of Company Common Stock as of September 6, 2018 (unless
otherwise indicated), the most recent practicable date by (i) each of the Company's "named executive officers" as determined pursuant to SEC rules, (ii) each director, (iii) all of
the Company's directors and executive officers as a group and (iv) each person who is known by the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class or series
of the Company's capital stock.

        The amounts and percentages of Company Common Stock beneficially owned are reported on the basis of the regulations of the SEC governing the determination of
beneficial ownership of securities. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the
power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also
deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Under these rules, more than one person may
be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities. Except as otherwise indicated, the named persons below have sole voting and investment power, or share voting and
investment power with their spouses, with respect to beneficially owned shares listed below.

        The percentages included in the table below are based on 15,884,250 outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, outstanding as of September 6, 2018:

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS 

        As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the board of directors is not aware of any business to be brought before the Special Meeting other than that described in this Proxy
Statement. If, however, other matters are properly presented at the Special Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their best judgment with respect to
those matters.

        If the merger is consummated, we will not have public shareholders and there will be no public participation in any future meeting of shareholders. However, if the merger is
not completed, we expect our annual meeting of shareholders to generally be held in June of each year. We will consider for inclusion in our proxy materials for the 2019 annual
meeting of shareholders proposals that are received no later than May 8, 2019 and that comply with all applicable requirements of Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, and our by-laws. Shareholders must submit their proposals to our corporate headquarters located at 3000 N.W. 107th Avenue, Miami, Florida 33172, Attention: Tricia
Thompkins, General Counsel and Secretary.

        In addition, any shareholder who wishes to propose a nominee to our board of directors or propose any other business to be considered by the shareholders (other than a
shareholder proposal to be included in our proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act) must comply with the advance notice provisions and other requirements
of Article Two, Section 14 of our by-laws, a copy of which is on file with the SEC and may be obtained from Tricia Thompkins, our General Counsel and Secretary upon request.
These notice provisions require that nominations of persons for election to our board of directors and proposals of business to be considered by the shareholders for the 2019
annual meeting of shareholders, to the extent such meeting is held, must be made in writing and submitted to our corporate headquarters located at 3000 N.W. 107th Avenue,
Miami, Florida 33172, Attention: Tricia Thompkins, General Counsel and Secretary, no earlier than March 14, 2019 and no later than April 12, 2019.

        If the merger is completed, we do not expect to hold our 2018 Annual Meeting.

HOUSEHOLDING 

        The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as a broker, bank or other agent) to implement a delivery procedure called "householding."
Under this procedure, multiple shareholders who reside at the same address may receive a single copy of our proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement and other proxy
materials, unless the affected shareholder has provided us with contrary instructions. This procedure provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies.

        Perry Ellis and some brokers, banks or other agents may be householding our proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement. A single set of this Proxy Statement and other
proxy materials will be delivered to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have
received notice from your broker, bank or other agent that it will be householding communications to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or
until you revoke your consent. If you did not respond that you did not want to participate in householding, you were deemed to have consented to the process. Registered
shareholders may revoke their consent at any time by contacting the Company's transfer agent Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, toll-free at 1 (800) 509-5586.
Holders through banks or brokers or other agents must notify such agents.

        Upon written or oral request, Perry Ellis will promptly deliver a separate copy of the Proxy Statement and other proxy materials to any shareholder at a shared address to
which a single copy of any of those documents was delivered. To receive a separate copy of the Proxy Statement and other proxy materials, you may send a written request to
3000 N.W. 107th Avenue, Miami, Florida 33172, Attention: Tricia Thompkins, General Counsel and Secretary or call (305) 592-2830. In addition, if you are receiving multiple
copies of the Proxy Statement and other proxy material, you can request householding by contacting our General Counsel and Secretary in the same manner.

WHERE SHAREHOLDERS CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION 

        The Company files certain reports and information with the SEC under the Exchange Act. You may obtain copies of this information in person or by mail from the public
reference room of the SEC, 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549, at prescribed rates. You may obtain information on the operation of the public reference
room by calling the SEC at (800) SEC-0330 or (202) 942-8090. The SEC also maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy statements and other information about
issuers like the Company, which file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is www.sec.gov.

        The Company files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy any reports, proxy statements or
other information that the Company files with the SEC at the following location of the SEC:

Public Reference Room
100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580
Washington, D.C. 20549

        Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the public reference rooms. You may also obtain copies of this information by mail from the Public
Reference Section of the SEC, 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549, at prescribed rates. The Company's public filings are also available to the public from
document retrieval services and the Internet website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov. The information provided on the Company's website is not part of this Proxy
Statement, and therefore is not incorporated by reference herein.

        Because the merger is a "going private" transaction, the Company and the GF Group Filing Persons have filed with the SEC a Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3
with respect to the proposed merger. The Schedule 13E-3, including any amendments and exhibits filed or incorporated by reference as part of it, is available for inspection as set
forth above. The reports, opinions or appraisals referenced in this Proxy Statement and filed as exhibits to the Schedule 13E-3 will also be made available for inspection and
copying at the principal executive offices of the Company during regular business hours by any interested holder of Company Common Stock or any representative who has been
so designated in writing.

        The information contained in this Proxy Statement speaks only as of the date indicated on the cover of this Proxy Statement unless the information specifically indicates that
another date applies. The information that the Company later files with the SEC may update and supersede the information in this Proxy Statement.

        The SEC allows the Company to "incorporate by reference" information into this Proxy Statement. This means that the Company can disclose important information by
referring to another document filed separately with the SEC. The information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Proxy Statement. This Proxy Statement
and the information that the Company later files with the SEC may update and supersede the information incorporated by reference. Similarly, the information that the Company
later files with the SEC may update and supersede the information in this Proxy Statement.

        The following documents filed with the SEC are incorporated by reference in this Proxy Statement:

• The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018; 

• Amendment No. 1 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018;

cancelled without any payment being made in respect thereof.

        (b)   Except as otherwise agreed in writing after the date hereof by Parent and the applicable holder thereof, the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate

SAR") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action by Parent,

without any payment being made in respect thereof.

        (c)   Except as otherwise agreed in writing after the date hereof by Parent and the applicable holder thereof or as otherwise provided below, each share of restricted

Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company Restricted Stock Award, shall be, at the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive from Parent or the
Surviving Corporation the Merger Consideration per share in accordance with Section 2.1(c); provided, however, that any Company Restricted Stock Award held by a
non-employee member of the Company Board shall, prior to such conversion, be prorated by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Stock Award by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that have elapsed since the grant date of such award and the denominator of
which is 365, with any fractional share rounded up to the nearest whole share. The Company Board or the compensation committee thereof shall take all necessary and
appropriate actions so that all Company Restricted Stock Awards shall be vested and all restricted periods shall lapse thereon in full as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

        (d)   Except as otherwise agreed in writing after the date hereof by Parent and the applicable holder thereof or as otherwise provided below or on Section 2.3(d) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, each share of restricted Common Stock that vests based on the achievement of performance goals (each, a "Company Performance Stock
Award", and together with the Company Restricted Stock Awards, the "Company Stock Awards") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company Performance Stock Award, shall be, at the Effective Time, converted
into the right to receive a restricted cash award on the same terms and conditions (including applicable time and/or service vesting conditions but excluding performance
goals) applicable to such Company Performance Stock Award under the applicable Company Equity Plan and award agreement in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, with respect to an amount of cash determined by multiplying the Merger Consideration by the number of shares of Common Stock that would vest based
on the achievement of any applicable performance goals at the target level. For the avoidance of doubt, any provisions relating to the forfeiture, acceleration of vesting or
payment of any award contained in a Company Performance Stock Award shall apply to the restricted cash award described in this Section 2.3(d) ; provided that, in the
event any such Company Performance Stock Award does not contain such an acceleration provision, such restricted cash award shall vest and be paid upon the
termination of the holder's employment by the Company without Cause or by the holder for Good Reason (each, as defined in the most recent Company Equity Plan), in
each case, subject to the execution and delivery (without revocation) of a release of claims in favor of the Company in the form provided by the Company; provided,
further, that any Company Performance Stock Award that vests by its terms upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, if any, shall be, at the Effective Time, converted

compensation committee thereof shall take all necessary and appropriate actions so that all Company Performance Stock Awards shall be treated in accordance with this
Section 2.3(d). Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, as applicable, make all the payments pursuant to the restricted cash awards

RSUs"), shall be canceled and the Company Equity Plans shall terminate at the Effective Time.

letter describing the treatment of and payment for such Company Options, Company SARs or Company Stock Awards pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing

Company SARs pursuant to this Section 2.3 will be made by check or wire transfer in accordance with the holder's instructions on file with the Company in respect of
payroll and, if no such instructions are applicable to such holder, may be, at the election of such holder, mailed to such holder or transferred to such holder by wire
transfer).

        (g)   As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth Business Day thereafter, Parent or the Surviving Corporation

holder pursuant to Section 2.3(a) in respect of such Company Option and (ii) to each applicable holder of a Company SAR, in such amount due and payable to such
holder pursuant to Section 2.3(b) in respect of such Company SAR. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of the payments contemplated by the immediately preceding
sentence, Parent and the Surviving Corporation may direct the Paying Agent to pay the Surviving Corporation (or its designees) for (but only to the extent of) any
amounts the Surviving Corporation elects to pay to each holder of a Company Option or Company SAR in respect of the consideration payable therefor plus any amounts
deducted and withheld with respect to any such amounts.

        Section 2.4    Dissenting Shares.     

        (a)   Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.4), any shares of Common Stock for which
the holder thereof (i) has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented to it in writing and (ii) has demanded the appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and has
complied in all respects with, the FBCA (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.1(c). At the Effective Time, (A) all Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and cease to exist and (B) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to
such rights as may be granted to them under the FBCA.

        (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(a), if any holder of Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights (through failure to
perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then that holder's shares (i) shall be deemed no longer to be Dissenting Shares and (ii) shall be treated as if they had been
converted automatically at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)

shares of Common Stock or securities that are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Common Stock are beneficially owned (as defined by Rule 13d-3 under the

when contributed to Parent under the Rollover Letters, will satisfy all minimum requirements for equity contributions to Parent under the Debt Financing (whether
expressed in terms of minimum value or percentage of shares), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Rollover Investors have
committed to contribute to Parent the amount of shares of Common Stock set forth therein (the "Rollover Investment"), and (y) a schedule setting forth each Rollover
Investor, the number of shares of the Company beneficially owned by and over which such Rollover Investor holds sole voting and dispositive power, and an indication

Financing" or the "Financing"). As of the date hereof, each of the Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letters is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent or

in the Financing Commitments or the Rollover Letters not being satisfied, (C) cause any of the Financing Commitments or the Rollover Letters to be ineffective or
(D) otherwise result in the Financing not being available, or the Rollover Investment not being made, in each case, on a timely basis in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date hereof, neither the Rollover Investors nor any Lender has notified Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to
terminate any Financing Commitment or not to provide the Financing, and none of the Rollover Investors has notified Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate
any Rollover Letter or not to make the Rollover Investment. Parent has not, without the prior written consent of the Company, amended, modified, supplemented or
waived any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in any Financing Commitment (including definitive agreements related thereto) or to the Rollover
Investment contained in any Rollover Letter, or any other provision of, or remedies under, any Financing Commitment (including definitive agreements related thereto) or
any Rollover Letter (except for any increases in the amount of funds available thereunder or the addition of Financing Sources in accordance with the terms thereof, or
other relevant entities who did not execute a Financing Commitment or a Rollover Letter as of the date of this Agreement or as otherwise expressly permitted by
Section 5.12(a)). Assuming (1) the Financing is funded in accordance with its terms and conditions, (2) the Rollover Investment is made in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Rollover Letters and (3) the satisfaction of the conditions to the Company's obligation to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 6.3(a), the net
proceeds from the Financing will, together with the Rollover Investment and other funds available to Parent, be sufficient to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger Consideration, any fees and expenses of or payable by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and any related repayment or refinancing of any indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and any other
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent or Merger Sub has paid in full any and all
commitment or other fees required by any Financing Commitment that are due as of the date hereof, and will pay, after the date hereof, all such commitments and fees as
they become due. There are no side letters, understandings or other agreements or arrangements relating to the Financing (except for customary fee letters and
engagement letters which do not contain any additional conditions to closing or other agreements relating to the availability of the full amount of the Financing, and a
complete copy of the fee letter has been made available to the Company with customary redactions of fee amounts, pricing caps, "market flex", other economic terms and
certain other terms, none of which redacted provisions would adversely affect the conditionality or aggregate principal amount of the Financing) or the Rollover
Investment to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates are a party that relate to the amount, availability or conditions of the Financing or the
Rollover Investment, other than the Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letters. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as explicitly set forth in the Financing Commitments, and there are no conditions precedent related to the contribution of the full amount of the
Rollover Investment, other than as explicitly set forth in the Rollover Letters. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to the Company's obligation to consummate the
Merger set forth in Section 6.3(a), neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any conditions to the funding
of the full amount of the Financing or the contribution of the full amount of the Rollover Investment, or that the Financing will not be available to, or that the Rollover
Investment will not be contributed to, Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement, nor to
the consummation of the Merger, for Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing, the Rollover Investment or any alternative financing.

transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries (including in connection with the making of any Takeover Proposal), in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), in

status, including any officer's, director's or current employee's status, that would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the parties to this Agreement to obtain, on a
timely basis, any authorization, consent, Order, declaration or approval of, or ability to contract with, any Governmental Authority or third party necessary for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        Section 4.10    Absence of Certain Arrangements.     Other than this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Rollover Letters and those other agreements contemplated

conditioned upon consummation of the Merger.

time in accordance with its terms, the "Limited Guarantee") and (b) a pledge and security agreement of George Feldenkreis (the "Pledgor") in favor of the Company, dated the

        Nothing contained in this Agreement gives, or is intended to give, Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
operations prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement gives, or is intended to give, the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
Parent's or its Subsidiaries' operations. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this

        Section 5.2    Conduct of Business of Parent.     Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) take or agree to take any action that would reasonably be expected to (a) delay or prevent the consummation of the

Subsidiaries or (B) disclose information to the extent such disclosure would, in the Company's good faith opinion after consultation with legal counsel, (x) result in a
waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege or (y) violate any applicable Law or any confidentiality obligation of such party. In the
event that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access or

investigation of the current or former operations or facilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company in its sole
discretion.

        Section 5.4    No Solicitation.     

        (a)   From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the date the Requisite Company Vote has been obtained or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VII hereof, and except as expressly permitted by the other provisions of this Section 5.4, the Company shall not, and the Company shall cause any of its
Subsidiaries not to, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives acting on its behalf not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of providing material non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
regarding a Takeover Proposal (other than to state that the Company is not permitted to have discussions or negotiations) or (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any Contract with respect to, a Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement). The Company
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Person conducted prior to the date of this
Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives with respect to any Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is agreed that if any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, acting on their behalf, takes any action that would constitute a breach of this Section 5.4,
such action shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.4 by the Company.

        (b)   Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a), following the receipt by the Company of a Takeover Proposal until the date the Requisite Company Vote has been obtained,
(i) the Special Committee and the Company Board shall be permitted to participate in discussions regarding such Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the terms of such
Takeover Proposal and (ii) with respect to a written, bona fide Takeover Proposal that did not result from any breach in any material respect of any of the provisions set
forth in this Section 5.4, if the Special Committee or the Company Board determines in good faith, (A) after consultation with the Company's outside legal and financial
advisors, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take the actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below with respect to such Takeover Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties, then the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal, (x) furnish access and non-public information with respect to the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, so long as any written material non-public
information provided under this clause (x) has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent promptly after being provided to such Person, and
(y) participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Special Committee and
the Company Board shall be permitted, to the extent it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, to modify, waive, amend or release any existing standstill obligations owed by any Person to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

        (c)   From and after the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal, specifying the
material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the party making such Takeover Proposal, and (ii) the

Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis with respect to the status and material terms of any such Takeover Proposal and shall promptly notify
the Company of any material modifications to the financial or other material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal, in each case within one Business Day after
(but not including) the date of the Company's receipt thereof.

        (d)   Except as set forth in Section 5.4(e) and Section 5.4(f), the Company Board and the Special Committee shall not (i) withdraw, modify or amend the Company
Board Recommendation in any manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to do so, (ii) approve, endorse or recommend a Takeover Proposal or publicly propose to do
so or (iii) approve, recommend or allow the Company to enter into a Contract relating to a Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

        (e)   Notwithstanding Section 5.4(d), the Special Committee or the Company Board may, at any time before obtaining the Requisite Company Vote and in response
to a Superior Proposal received by the Special Committee or the Company Board after the date of this Agreement, if the Special Committee or the Company Board has
concluded in good faith, following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that its failure to withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law, withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or terminate this Agreement to enter into a Contract with respect to such Superior Proposal, but only if:

(i) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 5.4; 

(ii) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Contract with respect to
such Superior Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms and conditions of the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal and the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal, and to the extent provided to the Company, a copy of any material Contract evidencing or relating to
the Superior Proposal; and 

(iii) Parent does not make, within four Business Days after the receipt of such notice (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the financial
or other terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal shall require an additional notice to Parent and a new two Business Day period), a proposal that
the Special Committee or the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor, causes the Takeover Proposal that
constituted a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; provided, that the Company (acting through the Special Committee) shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such period with respect to such
proposal to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Superior Proposal described in such notice ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal.

        (f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time before obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if any event, fact, development,
circumstance or occurrence (but specifically excluding any Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal) that improves the business, assets, operations or prospects of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (or that fundamentally impairs Parent's ability to consummate the Merger on the terms set forth herein) that was not known (and, other than
with respect to Parent, should not reasonably have been known) to the Special Committee and the Company Board (other than George Feldenkreis and Oscar Feldenkreis)

modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law,
then the Company Board may withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent but only if:

(i) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that the Special Committee or the Company Board intends to withdraw, modify or
amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, which notice shall include a description in reasonable detail of the
Intervening Event and the Company Board's reasons for taking such action; and 

(ii) Parent does not, within four Business Days after the receipt of such notice, propose revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in response to
such Intervening Event that the Special Committee or the Company Board determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, obviate the need for the Special Committee or the Company Board to withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation, and the
Company (acting through the Special Committee) shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) during such period with respect to such proposed revisions.

promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any required disclosure
to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Special Committee or the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure
to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise required under applicable Law; provided, that this
Section 5.4(g) shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to (or the Special Committee to recommend that the Company Board) change, withdraw, modify or
amend the Company Board Recommendation except to the extent permitted by Sections 5.4(e) - (f). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the issuance of a "stop,
look and listen" statement (or other similar statement pursuant to any requirement of applicable Law) constitute a change, withdrawal, modification or amendment of the
Company Board Recommendation under this Agreement.

        Section 5.6    Employees; Benefit Plans.     

        (a)   For a period of one year following the Closing Date (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to, provide to individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Employee") (i) a
salary or hourly wage rate and short-term (annual or more frequent) bonus or commission opportunity no less favorable than that provided to such Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other compensation and benefits (but not including equity and equity-based awards) that for such individual are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to such compensation and benefits being provided to Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (b)   Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to, honor all Company Employee Benefits (including all severance and
similar plans and agreements) in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that
may be permitted by such Company Employee Benefits and except as provided herein; provided, that nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any
specific plan, program policy, agreement or arrangement, or interfere with Parent's, the Surviving Corporation's or any of their respective Affiliates' rights or obligations
to make such changes, in each case as are necessary to comply with applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the later of the duration of the Continuation
Period or the remaining term of any individual employment, severance or separation agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide
each Employee who suffers a termination of employment under circumstances that would have given the Employee a right to severance payments and benefits under the
Company's severance policy or individual employment, severance or separation agreement or other arrangement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Company Severance Plan") with severance payments and benefits no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such Employee under any Company
Severance Plan. Following the end of the Continuation Period, Parent shall be permitted to alter the duties and employment terms applicable to a given Employee solely
to the extent permitted under the terms of any employment agreement with such Employee, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (c)   As of and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to, recognize, without duplication,

        (d)   With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time to which any Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy or individual agreement or other
arrangement applicable to such Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to, (i) allow such Employee to use such accrued vacation pursuant to the terms of Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's vacation policy, as in effect from time
to time, and (ii) if any Employee's employment terminates during the Continuation Period under circumstances entitling the Employee to severance pay under the
Company Severance Plan, pay the Employee, in cash, an amount equal to the value of the accrued vacation time.

Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates (including any Employee), any rights or remedies including any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.6, or restrict the ability of Parent, Surviving Corporation or

to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor of any present or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and the fiduciaries of any Company Employee Benefits (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in (i) the Organizational Documents of the Company, or
(ii) agreements between an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to survive the Merger and to continue in full force and effect for a period of not

        (b)   For a period of six years following the Effective Time (provided, that such period shall be extended with respect to all unresolved claims for indemnification by
any Indemnified Party as of the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claims are finally resolved), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold harmless all Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or
relating to their services as directors, officers or employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries or another Person, if such Indemnified Party is or was serving as a director,
officer or employee of such other Person at the request of the Company, or fiduciaries of Company Employee Benefits, whether asserted or claimed at, after or before the
Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise). If any Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any Legal Action in connection with any matter subject to indemnification hereunder, then Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, advance as incurred any costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or Liabilities ("Damages") arising out of or incurred in connection with such Legal Action, subject to Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's, as
applicable, receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party, if required by the FBCA, to repay such Damages if it is ultimately determined under
applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. In the event of any such Legal Action, (i) each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Legal Action and (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any Legal Action pending or threatened in writing to which an Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Legal Action.

        (c)   Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, maintain in effect for at least six years after the Effective Time the current policies of directors'
and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company or policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) so long as Parent and the Surviving Corporation are not required
to pay an annual premium in excess of 250% of the renewal premium paid or payable by the Company in connection with its June 2018 renewal (such 250% amount
being the "Maximum Premium"). If Parent and the Surviving Corporation are unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or
equal to the Maximum Premium, then Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of the arrangements contemplated by this Section 5.7(c), before the Effective
Time, the Company shall be entitled to purchase, and at the written request of Parent shall purchase, a "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance policy covering the
matters described in this Section 5.7(c) and, if the Company purchases such a policy before the Effective Time, then Parent and the Surviving Corporation's obligations
under this Section 5.7(c) shall be satisfied so long as Parent and the Surviving Corporation cause such policy to be maintained in effect for a period of six years following
the Effective Time.

        (d)   The covenants contained in this Section 5.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective
heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or
otherwise.

        (e)   In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary action so that the successors or assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation,

reasonably practicable; provided, that, prior to the Effective Time, in no event shall the Company or its Subsidiaries be required to pay, or otherwise incur any Liability with
respect to, any fees (except for customary fees to Governmental Authorities), penalties or other consideration to obtain any consent or approval required for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Section 5.8 shall not limit the rights of the Company set forth in Section 5.4.

the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the HSR Act, any Foreign Competition

advisable consistent with this Section 5.9 to cause the expiration of the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required consents, approvals or authorizations, as
applicable, under such Laws as soon as reasonably practicable. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of all
such filings and notifications, including by providing copies of all relevant documents to the non-filing party and its advisors before filing. No party shall consent to any
voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the
behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other parties to this Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

        (b)   As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall file, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to file, and, unless so requested by the applicable Governmental Authority, not withdraw any
notification and report forms and related material required to be filed by it with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice, as applicable,

information from any Governmental Authority that is related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or
cause to be made, to the extent practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response to such request. No party shall, or shall permit any of its
Affiliates to, participate in any meeting or engage in any material or substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority without giving the other party prior notice
of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. Parent shall advise the Company promptly
of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which Parent or any of its Affiliates proposes to make or enter into with any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust,
competition or trade regulatory Law as promptly as practicable.

        (d)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall take, and shall cause its Affiliates to take (and, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, including Section 5.1 and Section 5.4, the Company and its Affiliates shall be permitted to take, without affecting any representation,
warranty, covenant or condition in this Agreement), all action necessary to avoid the entry or to effect the dissolution of, or vacate or lift, any Order which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing impairing or delaying the Closing, including (i) selling, licensing, divesting or disposing of or holding separate any entities, assets,
Intellectual Property or businesses (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), (ii) terminating, amending or assigning
existing relationships or contractual rights and obligations, (iii) changing or modifying any course of conduct regarding future operations, (iv) otherwise taking actions
that would limit its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of their respective businesses, assets or rights or interests therein and
(v) committing to take any such actions in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) (all of the foregoing a "Divestiture Action"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent nor its Affiliates shall be required to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, take or agree to take or commit to
take any Divestiture Action with respect to any assets (whether tangible or intangible) that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect (with references to the Company in the definition thereof also being deemed to be references to Parent for purposes of this Section).
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to, take any action
with respect to any Order or any applicable Law which would bind the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or in the event the Merger does not occur.

        Section 5.10    Public Announcements.     The initial press release concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by the Company and Parent. Following such initial press release, except as provided for in this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements about this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither
Parent nor the Company shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except to the extent required by applicable Law or the
Applicable Exchange requirements, in which case that party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such release or making any such
public statement; provided, that each party may, without complying with the foregoing obligations, make any public statement regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, and may make internal announcements to employees, to the extent

costs and expenses (including those payable to Representatives) incurred by any party to this Agreement or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement ("Expenses") shall be paid by the party incurring those Expenses; except that (i) the filing fees for any filings made under the HSR Act or any
Foreign Competition Law shall be paid by Parent, and (ii) all documentary, sales, use, real property transfer, real property gains, registration, value added, transfer, stamp,
recording and similar Taxes, fees, and costs together with any interest thereon, penalties, fines, costs, fees, additions to Tax or additional amounts with respect thereto incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby ("Conveyance Taxes"), shall be paid by Parent, and Parent shall file all Tax Returns related thereto,
regardless of who may be liable therefor under applicable Law.

        Section 5.12    Financing Efforts.     

        (a)   Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing as soon as reasonably
practicable on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing Commitments (reflecting flex provisions to the extent exercised) and to consummate the Rollover
Investment pursuant to the Rollover Letters in accordance with the terms thereof, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with its obligations under the
Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing Commitments on terms and conditions
(reflecting flex provisions to the extent exercised) no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the respective Financing Commitments or on terms
and conditions otherwise acceptable to Parent that would not (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing unless the Rollover Investment is increased by a
corresponding amount or (B) impose new or additional conditions precedent to, or delay, the receipt of the Financing, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub contained in the Financing Commitments (including definitive agreements related thereto) and the Rollover Letters, including the
payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the Financing, and (iv) consummate the Financing and the Rollover Investment at
or prior to the Closing Date (it being understood that it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the Merger, for Parent or Merger
Sub to obtain the Financing, the Rollover Investment or any alternative financing). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately preceding sentence, each
of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, take all actions reasonably necessary to (i) maintain in effect each Financing Commitment and
each Rollover Letter (it being understood that the Financing Commitments and the Rollover Letters may be replaced or amended as provided below) and (ii) enforce all
of its rights under each Financing Commitment (or any definitive agreements relating thereto) and each Rollover Letter. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably

material breach or default by any party to any of the Financing Commitments, any Rollover Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which Parent or
Merger Sub becomes aware, (y) of the receipt of any (A) written notice or (B) other communication, in each case from any Person with respect to (1) any actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Commitments, any Rollover Letter or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of any provisions of any Financing Commitment, any Rollover Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing or (2) material dispute or disagreement

fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing or to consummate the Rollover Investment or the amount of shares of Common Stock to be
contributed prior to Closing, and (z) if at any time for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing or the Rollover Investment on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Financing Commitments, any Rollover
Letter or definitive agreements related the Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within three Business Days, Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence.
Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, amend, modify, supplement or waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in
any Financing Commitment (including definitive agreements related thereto) or to the making of the Rollover Investment contained in any Rollover Letter, or any other
provision of, or remedies under, any Financing Commitment (including definitive agreements related thereto) or any Rollover Letter, the effect of which (I) reduces (or
could have the effect of reducing) the amount of aggregate cash proceeds available from the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount other than as a result of the exercise of any related "market flex" provisions set forth in a fee letter) unless there is a corresponding increase in the Rollover
Investment, (II) imposes, or could reasonably be expected to impose, new or additional conditions or contingencies to the receipt of the Financing or otherwise expands,
amends or modifies any other material provision of any Financing Commitment, (III) would delay, prevent or adversely impact, or, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have the effect of delaying, preventing or adversely impacting, in each case, in any material respect, the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date, or (IV) would prevent or adversely impact or delay, or, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing, adversely impacting, or delaying, in each case, in any material respect the ability of Parent to timely consummate

the Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents, other agents or similar entities that have not executed the Financing
Commitments as of the date hereof or to increase the amount of funds available thereunder, and Parent or Merger Sub shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of
any such amendment, modification, supplement, restatement or replacement. In the event all conditions applicable to a Financing Commitment and/or a Rollover Letter
have been satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and the Rollover Investors to fund the Financing and make the Rollover Investment,

        Section 8.8    Amendment.     This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this Agreement at any time before the Effective Time, whether before or after obtaining the
Requisite Company Vote, so long as (a) no amendment that requires further stockholder approval under applicable Law after stockholder approval hereof shall be made without
such required further approval and (b) such amendment has been duly approved by the board of directors or manager, as applicable, of each of Merger Sub, Parent and the
Company (only pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Special Committee). This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the

FS Provisions (or any other provision of this agreement to the extent a waiver of such provision would modify the substance of any FS Provision) in a manner adverse to the
Financing Sources shall require the prior written consent of the Financing Sources. Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed by such party. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights,

for the benefit of holders of Common Stock, Company Options and Company Stock Awards as of the Effective Time) and (c) for the provisions of the last sentence of

Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely

Section 8.5(b), Section 8.6, Section 8.8, Section 8.9, this Section 8.11, Section 8.14 and Section 8.18 (collectively, the "FS Provisions"). The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 8.9 without notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may

than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

        Section 8.12    Severability.     The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid
or unenforceable, then (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for that provision in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and
purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of that provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of that provision, or the application of that
provision, in any other jurisdiction. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

        Section 8.13    Rules of Construction.     The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by
virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. Subject to and without limiting the introductory language to Article III and Article IV, each party to this Agreement
has or may have set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a section of such disclosure letter that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates.
The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not constitute an admission by such party that such item is material, that such item
has had or would have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or that the disclosure of such be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

or delegate, by operation of law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights or liabilities under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, which any such party may withhold in its absolute discretion; and any purported assignment without such prior written consents shall be void; provided that,
notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any Financing Source (so long as any such
assignment does not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its respective obligations hereunder) under terms of the Financing solely for the purpose of creating a security interest herein
or otherwise assigning collateral with respect to the Financing.

        Section 8.15    Specific Performance.     

        (a)   The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other
remedy at law or in equity, and the parties to this Agreement hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection therewith. The
parties acknowledge and agree that each party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each party
hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (a) the other party has an adequate
remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

        (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief in each case to cause Parent and Merger Sub to close the Merger shall be subject to the requirements that:

(i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 would have been satisfied if the Closing were to have occurred at such time (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing, or the
failure of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement); 

(ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 upon delivery of a
drawdown notice by Parent and/or notice from Parent that the Rollover Investment will be funded at such date; 

(iii) Parent fails to complete the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2; and 

(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that (A) all of the conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 have been satisfied or that it is
willing to waive any such open conditions, and (B) if specific performance is granted and if the Financing and the Rollover Investment were funded, the
Closing would occur.

        (c)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, while the Company may be entitled to (i) specific performance, subject in all respects to this
Section 8.15, and (ii) payment of the Parent Termination Fee, if, as and when payable pursuant to Section 7.6(d), under no circumstances shall the Company, directly or
indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive (A) both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to which the Merger is actually consummated and
the aggregate Merger Consideration is actually received, on the one

Termination Fee, on the one hand, and payment of other monetary damages, on the other hand.

        (d)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub for monetary damages or other
monetary remedies in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be limited to an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee, and in
no event shall any Company Related Party seek or obtain, nor shall it permit any of its Representatives or any other Persons on its or their behalf to seek or obtain, any
monetary recovery or monetary award or any monetary damages of any kind against Parent and Merger Sub in excess of the Parent Termination Fee.

        Section 8.16    Counterparts; Effectiveness.     This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, as if the signatures to each counterpart were upon a single
instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed an original of this Agreement. Facsimile signatures or signatures received as a pdf attachment to electronic mail
shall be treated as original signatures for all purposes of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when, and only when, each party hereto shall have received a
counterpart signed by all of the other parties hereto.

        Section 8.17    Special Committee Approval.     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no
decision or determination shall be made, or action taken, by or on behalf of the Company under or with respect to this Agreement without first obtaining the approval of the
Special Committee.

        Section 8.18    No Recourse to Financing Sources.     Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Financing Commitments to the contrary, (i) no Financing Source shall have
any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties hereto, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives, or for any claim (whether in tort, contract
or otherwise), based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement, the Financing, the Financing Commitments or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith and (ii) neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives shall
have any rights or claims (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) against any Financing Source based on, in respect of, by reason of, or in any way relating to this Agreement, the
Financing, the Financing Commitments or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, other than pursuant to the Financing Commitments with respect to Parent and/or Merger Sub, (i) in no
event shall any party hereto, nor any of its Affiliates, and each of the parties hereto hereby agrees not to and to cause its Affiliates not to, (a) seek to enforce this Agreement
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Financing Source or (b) seek to enforce the commitments against,
make any claims for breach of the Debt Commitment Letters against, or seek to obtain any other damages of any kind from, or otherwise sue, the Financing Sources for any
reason, including in connection with the Debt Commitment Letters. Nothing in this Section 8.18 shall in any way limit or qualify the liabilities of the Financing Sources and the
other parties to the Financing (or the definitive documents entered into pursuant thereto) to each other thereunder or in connection therewith. No Financing Source shall be
subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages or a tortious nature.

        Section 8.19    Breach of Rollover Investors Disregarded.     Any breach or assertion of any breach of this Agreement by the Company or any of its Representatives that is
attributable to or caused by the actions of or failure to act by George Feldenkreis or Oscar Feldenkreis, including in connection with any representations or warranties made
hereunder or any actions taken or failure to act, in each case in contravention hereof, shall be disregarded for all purposes under this Agreement.

determine or as the business of the Corporation may require.

ARTICLE II 

MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS 

        Section 1.    Meetings of the shareholders may be held at such place either within or without the State of Florida as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of
Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof.

        Section 2.    Annual meetings of shareholders shall be held on such date and at such time as may be fixed from time to time, provided, that there shall be an annual meeting
held every calendar year at which shareholders shall elect a Board of Directors and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

        Section 3.    Special meetings of the shareholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation, may be called by
the Chairman of the Board or the President of the Corporation, and shall be called by the Board of Directors at the request in writing of a majority of the Board of Directors or at
the request in writing of the holders of not less than 50% of all the shares entitled to vote at a meeting which shall state in such request the purpose or purposes of the proposed
meeting.

        Section 4.    The officer or agent who has charge of the stock transfer book for shares of the Corporation shall make and certify a complete list of the shareholders entitled to

shareholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise expressly required by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws. All shareholders present in
person or represented by proxy at such meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a
quorum. If, however, such quorum shall not be initially present at any meeting of shareholders, a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote thereat shall nevertheless have
power to adjourn the meeting from time to time and to another place, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At
such adjourned meeting, at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
If after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the

meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting.

        Section 7.    When an action other than the election of directors is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized if the votes cast favoring the action exceed
the votes cast against the action, except as otherwise expressly required by statute, the Articles of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, in which case such express provision shall
govern and control the decision of such question. "Shares represented at the meeting" shall be determined as of the time the existence of the quorum is determined. Except as
otherwise expressly required by the Articles of Incorporation, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an election.

        Section 8.    Except as otherwise provided by law or the Articles, each shareholder shall at every meeting of the shareholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for
each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such shareholder except as otherwise expressly required in the Articles of Incorporation. A vote may be cast either
orally or in writing. Each proxy shall be in writing and signed by the shareholder or his authorized agent or representative. A proxy is not valid after the expiration of 11 months
after its date unless the person executing it specifies therein the length of time for which it is to continue in force. Unless prohibited by law, a proxy otherwise validly granted by
facsimile shall be deemed to have been signed by the granting shareholder. All questions regarding the qualification of voters, the validity of proxies and the acceptance or
rejection of votes shall be decided by the presiding officer of the meeting.

        Section 9.    Attendance of a person at a meeting of shareholders in person or by proxy constitutes a waiver of notice of the meeting except where the shareholder, at the
beginning of the meeting, objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting.

        Section 10.    Any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders, or any other action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting
of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon
were present and voted. Within 10 days after obtaining such authorization by written consent, notice shall be given to those shareholders who have not consented in writing. The
notice shall fairly summarize the material features of the authorized action and, if the action is of a type for which dissenters' rights are provided for by statute, the notice shall
contain a clear statement of the right of shareholders dissenting therefrom to be paid the fair value of their shares upon compliance with further provisions of such statute
regarding the rights of dissenting shareholders.

shareholders, except as provided in Section 3 of this Article, and each director elected shall hold office until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his death,

of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, or by the shareholders, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual
election of directors by the shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until their death, resignation or removal. Any director may be removed, with
or without cause, by the shareholders at a meeting of the shareholders called expressly for that purpose. A director may resign by written notice to the Corporation. The
resignation is effective upon its delivery to the Corporation or a subsequent time as set forth in the notice of resignation.

        Section 4.    The Board of Directors may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Florida. Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of
Incorporation, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the board or committee by means of
conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting
pursuant to this section shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

        Section 5.    Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors or by
the President of the Corporation. Any notice given of a regular meeting need not specify the business to be transacted or the purpose of the meeting. Regular meetings of the
Board of Directors may also be held without notice.

        Section 6.    Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Board of Directors or President of the Corporation on two days' notice to each director by mail
or 24 hours' notice either personally or by telephone or facsimile transmission. The notice need not specify the business to be transacted or the purpose of the special meetings.
The notice shall specify the place of the special meeting.

        Section 7.    At all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of the number of directors then serving shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. At all
meetings of a committee of the Board of Directors a majority of the directors then members of the committee in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

number is specifically required by statute, by the Articles of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors or a
committee, the

members present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time and to another place without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

        Section 8.    Unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any
committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if, before or after the action, all members of the Board of Directors or committee consent thereto in writing. The written
consents shall be filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee. Such consents shall have the same effect as a vote of the Board of Directors or
committee for all purposes.

        Section 9.    A majority of the full Board of Directors may, by resolution, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any
meeting of the committee. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of
Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation; provided, however, such a committee shall not have the power or authority to:

        (a)   approve or recommend to shareholders actions or proposals required by statute to be approved by the shareholders,

        (b)   fill vacancies on the Board of Directors or any committee thereof,

voting group, except that the Board of Directors may authorize a committee (or an officer of the Corporation) to do so within limits specifically prescribed by the Board
of Directors.

Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. A committee, and each
member thereof, shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.

        Section 10.    Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors when required.

        Section 11.    By resolution of the Board of Directors and irrespective of any personal interest of any director, the Board of Directors may establish reasonable compensation
of directors for services to the Corporation as directors, officers or members of a committee. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any
other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

        Section 12.    Attendance of a director at a meeting constitutes a waiver of notice of the meeting except where a director states, at the beginning of the meeting or promptly
upon arrival at the meeting, any objection to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

        Section 3.    The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate for shares to be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been
lost or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new
certificate, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost or destroyed certificate, or his legal
representative, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate
alleged to have been lost or destroyed.

        Section 4.    Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of
succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record
the transaction upon its stock transfer book for shares of the Corporation.

        Section 5.    In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or for the purpose of any other action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a
date as a record date, which shall not be more than 70 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting, nor more than 70 days prior to any other action. The stock transfer
books of the Corporation shall not be closed.

        If no record date is fixed:

        (a)   The record date for determining the shareholders of record entitled to notice of, or to vote at, a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the
day on which notice is given, or, if no notice is given, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and

        (b)   The record date for determining shareholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution relating thereto.

        A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that
the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

        Section 6.    The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered upon its stock transfer book for shares of the Corporation as the owner
of shares for all purposes, including voting and dividends, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to interest in such share or shares on the part of any
other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Florida.

ARTICLE VII 

INDEMNIFICATION 

        Section 1.    Subject to the other provisions of this Article, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by the Florida Business
Corporation Act, as amended (the "FBCA"), as the same exists now or as it may be hereinafter amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), any person (and the
heirs, executors, administrators or estate of such person) who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or otherwise becomes involved in, a Proceeding (as defined
in Section 17 of this Article) other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was serving, or had agreed to serve, in an
Official Capacity (as defined in

Section 17 of this Article) for the Corporation, or while serving in an Official Capacity for the Corporation is or was serving at the request of the Corporation in an Official
Capacity for another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (an "Other Enterprise"), including service with respect to employee
benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation, or is an employee of the Corporation specifically designated by the Board of Directors as an indemnified employee
(hereinafter, each of the foregoing persons, a "Covered Person"), against Expenses (as defined in Section 17 of this Article), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in
or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful. The
termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the
person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful.

        Section 2.    Subject to the other provisions of this Article, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by the FBCA, any Covered
Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or otherwise becomes involved in, a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation against Expenses
actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine
upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
Expenses which such court shall deem proper.

        Section 3.    To the extent that a Covered Person has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding described in Section 1 or Section 2 of this
Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection
therewith.

        Section 4.    Subject to the other provisions of this Article, the Corporation shall have power to indemnify its employees and its agents to the extent not prohibited by the
FBCA or other applicable law. The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate the determination of whether employees or agents shall be indemnified to such person or
persons as the Board of Directors determines.

        Section 5.

        (a)   Expenses incurred by any Covered Person in defending any Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding.
Such advances shall be paid by the Corporation within ten (10) calendar days after the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from the claimant
requesting such advance or advances from time to time; provided, that if Florida law requires, the payment of such Expenses incurred by a Covered Person in his or her
capacity as a director or officer shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking in writing (the "Undertaking") by or on behalf of such Covered
Person to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right of appeal (a "final disposition")
that such Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified for such Expenses under this Bylaw or otherwise. The Covered Person's undertaking to repay the Corporation
any amounts advanced for Expenses shall not be required to be secured and shall not bear interest.

        (b)   Except as otherwise provided in the FBCA or this Section 5 of this Article, the Corporation shall not impose on the Covered Person additional conditions to the
advancement of Expenses or require from the Covered Person additional undertakings regarding repayment. Advancements of Expenses shall be made without regard to
the Covered Person's ability to repay the Expenses.

        (c)   Advancements of Expenses pursuant to this subsection shall not require approval of the Board of Directors or the shareholders of the Corporation, or of any
other person or body. The Secretary shall promptly advise the Board of Directors in writing of the request for advancement of Expenses, of the amount and other details
of the request and of the undertaking to make repayment provided pursuant to this Section 5.

        (d)   Advancements of Expenses to a Covered Person shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement,
including Expenses incurred preparing and forwarding statements to the Corporation to support the advancements claimed.

        (e)   The right to advancement of Expenses shall not apply to (i) any action, suit or proceeding against an agent brought by the Corporation and approved by a
majority of the authorized members of the Board of Directors which alleges willful misappropriation of corporate assets by such agent, wrongful disclosure of
confidential information, or any other willful and deliberate breach in bad faith of such agent's duty to the Corporation or its shareholders, or (ii) any claim for which
indemnification is excluded pursuant to these Bylaws, but shall apply to any Proceeding referenced in Section 6(b) or Section 6(c) of this Article prior to a determination
that the person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation.

        Section 6.    Subject to the requirements in Section 3 of this Article and the FBCA, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any person pursuant to this Article in
connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding):

        (a)   for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of such person under any statute, insurance policy, indemnity provision, vote or otherwise, except
with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid;

        (b)   initiated by such person against the Corporation or its directors, officers, employees, agents or other indemnitees, unless (a) the Board of Directors authorized
the Proceeding (or the relevant part of the Proceeding) prior to its initiation, (b) the Corporation provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers
vested in the Corporation under applicable law, (c) otherwise required to be made under Section 7 of this Article or (d) otherwise required by applicable law; or

        (c)   if prohibited by applicable law; provided, however, that if any provision or provisions of this Article shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any
reason whatsoever: (1) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Article (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph or
clause containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby; and (2) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article (including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph or
clause containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

by a claimant for indemnification, a determination (the "Determination"), if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimant's entitlement thereto shall be made as
follows: (i) by the Board of Directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors (as defined in Section 17 of this Article); (ii) if such a quorum of
Disinterested Directors cannot be obtained, by majority vote of a committee duly designated by the Board of Directors (in which all directors, whether or not
Disinterested Directors, may participate) consisting solely of two or more Disinterested Directors; (iii) if such a committee cannot be designated, by any Independent
Counsel (as defined in Section 17 of this Article) selected by the Board of Directors prescribed in (i) above or by the committee of the Board of Directors prescribed in
(ii) above, in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant; or if a quorum of the Board of Directors cannot be obtained
for (a) above and the committee cannot be designated under (b) below, selected by majority vote of the full Board of Directors (in which directors who are parties may
participate); or (iii) if such Independent Counsel determination cannot be obtained, by majority vote of a quorum consisting of shareholders who are not parties to such
Proceeding, or if no such quorum is obtainable, by a majority vote of shareholders who are not parties to the Proceeding. If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled
to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within ten (10) calendar days after such determination.

        (b)   (i) If a claim for indemnification under this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) calendar days after a written claim pursuant to
Section 7(a) above has been received by the Corporation, or (ii) if a request for advancement of Expenses under this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation within
ten (10) calendar days after a statement pursuant to Section 5 above and the required Undertaking, if any, have been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the unpaid amount of the claim for indemnification or request for
advancement of Expenses and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also any and all Expenses incurred in connection with prosecuting
such claim. In any such suit, the Corporation shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proving that the claimant is not entitled to the requested
indemnification or advancement of Expenses. It shall be a defense to any such action that, under the FBCA or other applicable law, the claimant has not met the standard
of conduct which makes it permissible for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed or that the claimant is not entitled to the requested
advancement of Expenses, but (except where the required Undertaking, if any, has not been tendered to the Corporation) the burden of proving such defense shall be on
the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Disinterested Directors, Independent Counsel or shareholders) to have made a determination prior to
the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth under the FBCA or other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Disinterested Directors, Independent Counsel or shareholders)
that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable
standard of conduct.

        (c)   The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the person's conduct was unlawful.

APPENDIX B 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

        You have asked us to advise you with respect to the fairness to the holders (other than Feldenkreis Holdings LLC ("Parent") and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of Perry Ellis International, Inc. (the "Company"), from a financial point of view of the $27.50 in cash per Share (the
"Consideration") to be paid to the holders of the Shares pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 15, 2018 (the "Agreement"), by Parent, GF
Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the Company.

        We understand that the Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the
merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger"), and that, upon effectiveness of the Merger, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the Merger (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares (each as defined in the Agreement) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
Consideration.

        For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:

          (i)  reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other information of the Company;

         (ii)  reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company prepared and provided to us by the management
of the Company and approved for our use by the Company;

        (iii)  reviewed certain financial projections for the Company prepared and provided to us by the management of the Company and approved for our use by the
Company;

        (iv)  discussed the past and current operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company with management of the Company;

         (v)  reviewed the reported prices and trading activity of the Shares;

        (vi)  compared the financial performance and condition of the Company and the reported prices and trading activity of the Shares with that of certain other publicly
traded companies that we deemed relevant;

       (vii)  reviewed publicly available information regarding the financial terms of certain transactions that we deemed relevant, in whole or in part, to the Merger;

      (viii)  participated in certain discussions among management and other representatives of each of Parent and the Company;

        (ix)  reviewed a draft of the Agreement dated June 15, 2018; and

         (x)  performed such other analyses and reviewed such other material and information as we have deemed appropriate.

        We have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the information reviewed by us for the purposes of this opinion and we have not assumed any
responsibility for independent verification of such information and have relied on such information being complete and correct. We have relied on assurances of the management
of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or

circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading in any respect material to our opinion. With respect to the financial projections, we have assumed that
the financial projections were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of management of the Company of the future financial
performance of the Company. We have not conducted a physical inspection of the facilities or property of the Company. We have not assumed any responsibility for or performed
any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such valuation or appraisal. Furthermore, we have not
considered any tax, accounting or legal effects of the Merger or the transaction structure on any person or entity.

        We have assumed that the final form of the Agreement will be substantially the same as the last draft reviewed by us and will not vary in any respect material to our analysis.
We have also assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term,
condition or agreement (including, without limitation, the Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the Shares in the Merger) and that, in the
course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that
would have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits of the Merger. We have further assumed that all representations and warranties set forth in the
Agreement are and will be true and correct as of all the dates made or deemed made and that all parties to the Agreement will comply with all covenants of such parties
thereunder.

        Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of June 14, 2018. In particular, we do
not express any opinion as to the prices at which the Shares may trade at any future time or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub or the ability of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Furthermore, our opinion does not address the
Company's underlying business decision to undertake the Merger, and our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative transactions
or business strategies that might be available to the Company. Our opinion does not address any other aspect or implication of the Merger or any other agreement, arrangement or
understanding entered into in connection with the Merger or otherwise except as expressly identified herein.

        Natixis, S.A. ("Natixis"), which became the holder of a majority of our outstanding equity on June 8, 2016, is, together with its affiliates, engaged in advisory, underwriting
and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment management, insurance and other financial and nonfinancial activities and services for various persons
and entities. Natixis and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-
invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and
other financial instruments of the Company, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, including affiliates of George Feldenkreis, an affiliate of Parent (the
"Principal Shareholder"), or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the Merger.

        We have acted as financial advisor to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will receive a fee for our
services, a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger and a portion of which is payable upon the delivery of this letter. In addition, the Company
has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. We have not during the two years prior to the date hereof
provided any financial advisory services to the Company, Parent, the Principal Shareholder or their respective affiliates for which we received payment. In the future, we, Natixis
and our respective affiliates may provide financial advisory services to the Company, Parent, the Principal

        This letter and our advisory services are provided for the information and assistance of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Board of
Directors of the Company (in their capacities as such) in connection with their consideration of the Merger. This letter may not be reproduced, summarized, described, referred to
or used for any other purpose without our prior written consent, except as part of a proxy statement that is required to be filed by the Company in connection with the Merger,
except to the extent provided in our engagement letter dated February 22, 2018. We express no view as to, and our opinion does not address, the fairness (financial or otherwise)
of the amount or nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the
Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the Shares pursuant to the Agreement. This letter does not constitute a recommendation to any
holder of Shares as to how any such holder should vote on the Merger or act on any matter relating to the Merger. The issuance of this opinion has been authorized by our
fairness opinion committee.

        Based on, and subject to, the foregoing, we are of the opinion that on the date hereof, the Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the
Shares pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

        (j)    A merger, conversion, or share exchange of a benefit corporation to which s. 607.604 applies.

        (2)   Notwithstanding subsection (1), the availability of appraisal rights under paragraphs (1)(a), (b), (c), and (d) shall be limited in accordance with the following

        (b)   The applicability of paragraph (a) shall be determined as of:

        1.     The record date fixed to determine the shareholders entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the meeting of shareholders to act upon the
corporate action requiring appraisal rights; or

        2.     If there will be no meeting of shareholders, the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution recommending
such corporate action.

        (c)   Paragraph (a) shall not be applicable and appraisal rights shall be available pursuant to subsection (1) for the holders of any class or series of shares who
are required by the terms of the corporate action requiring appraisal rights to accept for such shares anything other than cash or shares of any class or any series of
shares of any corporation, or any other proprietary interest of any other entity, that satisfies the standards set forth in paragraph (a) at the time the corporate action
becomes effective.

        (d)   Paragraph (a) shall not be applicable and appraisal rights shall be available pursuant to subsection (1) for the holders of any class or series of shares if:

        1.     Any of the shares or assets of the corporation are being acquired or converted, whether by merger, share exchange, or otherwise, pursuant to the
corporate action by a person, or by an affiliate of a person, who:

        a.     Is, or at any time in the 1-year period immediately preceding approval by the board of directors of the corporate action requiring
appraisal rights was, the beneficial owner of 20 percent or more of the voting power of the corporation, excluding any shares acquired pursuant to

person, or by an affiliate of a person, who is, or at any time in the 1-year period immediately preceding approval by the board of directors of the corporate
action requiring appraisal rights was, a senior executive or director of the corporation or a senior executive of any affiliate thereof, and that senior
executive or director will receive, as a result of the corporate action, a financial benefit not generally available to other shareholders as such, other than:

        a.     Employment, consulting, retirement, or similar benefits established separately and not as part of or in contemplation of the corporate
action;

        b.     Employment, consulting, retirement, or similar benefits established in contemplation of, or as part of, the corporate action that are not
more favorable than those existing before the corporate action or, if more favorable, that have been approved on behalf of the corporation in the
same manner as is provided in s. 607.0832; or

        c.     In the case of a director of the corporation who will, in the corporate action, become a director of the acquiring entity in the corporate
action or one of its affiliates, rights and benefits as a director that are provided on the same basis as those afforded by the acquiring entity generally
to other directors of such entity or such affiliate.

        (e)   For the purposes of paragraph (d) only, the term "beneficial owner" means any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, or
understanding, other than a revocable proxy, has or shares the power to vote, or to direct the voting of, shares, provided that a member of a national securities
exchange shall not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities held directly or indirectly by it on behalf of another person solely because such member is the
recordholder of such securities if the member is precluded by the rules of such exchange from voting without instruction on contested matters or matters that may
affect substantially the rights or privileges of the holders of the securities to be voted. When two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of voting
their shares of the corporation, each member of the group formed thereby shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership, as of the date of such
agreement, of all voting shares of the corporation beneficially owned by any member of the group.

        (3)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the articles of incorporation as originally filed or any amendment thereto may limit or eliminate appraisal
rights for any class or series of preferred shares, but any such limitation or elimination contained in an amendment to the articles of incorporation that limits or eliminates
appraisal rights for any of such shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of such amendment or that the corporation is or may be required to issue
or sell thereafter pursuant to any conversion, exchange, or other right existing immediately before the effective date of such amendment shall not apply to any corporate
action that becomes effective within 1 year of that date if such action would otherwise afford appraisal rights.

        (4)   A shareholder entitled to appraisal rights under this chapter may not challenge a completed corporate action for which appraisal rights are available unless such
corporate action:

        (a)   Was not effectuated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section or the corporation's articles of incorporation, bylaws, or board of
directors' resolution authorizing the corporate action; or

        (b)   Was procured as a result of fraud or material misrepresentation.

        (1)   A shareholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must execute and return the form received pursuant to s. 607.1322(1) and, in the case of certificated
shares, deposit the shareholder's certificates in accordance with the terms of the notice by the date referred to in the notice pursuant to s. 607.1322(2)(b)2. Once a
shareholder deposits that shareholder's certificates or, in the case of uncertificated shares, returns the executed forms, that shareholder loses all rights as a shareholder,
unless the shareholder withdraws pursuant to subsection (2).

        (2)   A shareholder who has complied with subsection (1) may nevertheless decline to exercise appraisal rights and withdraw from the appraisal process by so
notifying the corporation in writing by the date set forth in the appraisal notice pursuant to s. 607.1322(2)(b)6. A shareholder who fails to so withdraw from the appraisal
process may not thereafter withdraw without the corporation's written consent.

        (3)   A shareholder who does not execute and return the form and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit that shareholder's share certificates if required, each by
the date set forth in the notice described in subsection (2), shall not be entitled to payment under this chapter.

        (1)   If the shareholder states on the form provided in s. 607.1322(1) that the shareholder accepts the offer of the corporation to pay the corporation's estimated fair
value for the shares, the corporation shall make such payment to the shareholder within 90 days after the corporation's receipt of the form from the shareholder.

        (2)   Upon payment of the agreed value, the shareholder shall cease to have any interest in the shares.

        History.—s. 28, ch. 2003-283.

        607.1330    Court action.—

        (1)   If a shareholder makes demand for payment under s. 607.1326 which remains unsettled, the corporation shall commence a proceeding within 60 days after
receiving the payment demand and petition the court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest. If the corporation does not commence the proceeding
within the 60-day period, any shareholder who has made a demand pursuant to s. 607.1326 may commence the proceeding in the name of the corporation.

        (2)   The proceeding shall be commenced in the appropriate court of the county in which the corporation's principal office, or, if none, its registered office, in this
state is located. If the corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in this state, the proceeding shall be commenced in the county in this state in which
the principal office or registered office of the domestic corporation merged with the foreign corporation was located at the time of the transaction.

        (3)   All shareholders, whether or not residents of this state, whose demands remain unsettled shall be made parties to the proceeding as in an action against their
shares. The corporation shall serve a copy of the initial pleading in such proceeding upon each shareholder party who is a resident of this state in the manner provided by
law for the service of a summons and complaint and upon each nonresident shareholder party by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law.

        (4)   The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under subsection (2) is plenary and exclusive. If it so elects, the court may appoint one or
more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers shall have the powers described in the order
appointing them or in any amendment to the order. The shareholders demanding appraisal rights are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil
proceedings. There shall be no right to a jury trial.

        (5)   Each shareholder made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment for the amount of the fair value of such shareholder's shares, plus interest, as found by
the court.

        (6)   The corporation shall pay each such shareholder the amount found to be due within 10 days after final determination of the proceedings. Upon payment of the
judgment, the shareholder shall cease to have any interest in the shares.

        (1)   The court in an appraisal proceeding shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by
the court. The court shall assess the costs against the corporation, except that the court may assess costs against all or some of the shareholders demanding appraisal, in
amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds such shareholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by
this chapter.

equitable:

        (a)   Against the corporation and in favor of any or all shareholders demanding appraisal if the court finds the corporation did not substantially comply with
ss. 607.1320 and 607.1322; or

        (b)   Against either the corporation or a shareholder demanding appraisal, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees
and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this chapter.

        (3)   If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the services of counsel for any shareholder were of substantial benefit to other shareholders similarly situated,
and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may award to such counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts
awarded the shareholders who were benefited.

        (4)   To the extent the corporation fails to make a required payment pursuant to s. 607.1324, the shareholder may sue directly for the amount owed and, to the extent
successful, shall be entitled to recover from the corporation all costs and expenses of the suit, including counsel fees.

        607.1332    Disposition of acquired shares.—Shares acquired by a corporation pursuant to payment of the agreed value thereof or pursuant to payment of the judgment
entered therefor, as provided in this chapter, may be held and disposed of by such corporation as authorized but unissued shares of the corporation, except that, in the case of a
merger or share exchange, they may be held and disposed of as the plan of merger or share exchange otherwise provides. The shares of the surviving corporation into which the
shares of such shareholders demanding appraisal rights would have been converted had they assented to the merger shall have the status of authorized but unissued shares of the
surviving corporation.

        History.—s. 31, ch. 2003-283.

        607.1333    Limitation on corporate payment.—

        (1)   No payment shall be made to a shareholder seeking appraisal rights if, at the time of payment, the corporation is unable to meet the distribution standards of
s. 607.06401. In such event, the shareholder shall, at the shareholder's option:

        (a)   Withdraw his or her notice of intent to assert appraisal rights, which shall in such event be deemed withdrawn with the consent of the corporation; or

        (b)   Retain his or her status as a claimant against the corporation and, if it is liquidated, be subordinated to the rights of creditors of the corporation, but have
rights superior to the shareholders not asserting appraisal rights, and if it is not liquidated, retain his or her right to be paid for the shares, which right the
corporation shall be obliged to satisfy when the restrictions of this section do not apply.

        (2)   The shareholder shall exercise the option under paragraph (1)(a) or paragraph (1)(b) by written notice filed with the corporation within 30 days after the
corporation has given written notice that the payment for shares cannot be made because of the restrictions of this section. If the shareholder fails to exercise the option,
the shareholder shall be deemed to have withdrawn his or her notice of intent to assert appraisal rights.

        History.—s. 32, ch. 2003-283.
