Per unit price or other underlying value of transaction computed pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 0-11 (Set forth the amount on which the
filing fee is calculated and state how it was determined): In accordance with Exchange Act Rule 0-11(c), the filing fee of $64,370.87 was
determined by multiplying 0.0001245 by the aggregate merger consideration of $517,035,129.76. The aggregate merger consideration was
calculated by multiplying the 41,555,754 outstanding shares of common stock (including 789,967 shares of common stock subject to
vesting) by the per share merger consideration of $12.44, which consists of $11.44 in upfront per share consideration and one contingent
value right that NewStar estimates could result in additional cash payments of up to $1.00 per share, and adding the foregoing product to
$81,550.00, the product obtained by multiplying the 35,000 shares of common stock subject to outstanding employee stock options by
$2.33, the per share merger consideration of $12.44 less the $10.11 weighted average exercise price per share of such outstanding
employee stock options (in each case, as of the close of business of November 6, 2017). As all of the warrants have an exercise price per
share of $12.62, which is higher than the per share merger consideration of $12.44, no consideration will be payable in respect of the
12,000,000 shares of common stock subject to outstanding warrants.

NEWSTAR FINANCIAL, INC.
500 Boylston Street, Suite 1250

Boston, MA 02116

November 29, 2017

Dear Stockholder:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the stockholders of NewStar Financial, Inc., which we will hold at the offices of Locke Lord
LLP, 111 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, on December 21, 2017, at 10 a.m., local time.

As previously announced, on October 16, 2017 NewStar entered into a merger agreement with First Eagle Holdings, Inc. and an asset purchase
agreement with GSO Diamond Portfolio Holdco LLC, a subsidiary of a newly formed investment fund advised by GSO Capital Partners LP.

Under the merger agreement, NewStar will be acquired by a subsidiary of First Eagle and holders of our common stock will be entitled to receive for
each share of NewStar common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the merger (i) $11.44 in cash and (ii) one contractual contingent value
right. The contingent value rights, as more fully described in the attached proxy statement, represent the right to receive the net tax refunds that are
expected to be received by NewStar following the closing as a result of tax losses generated primarily by the proposed transactions. We estimate these
tax refunds will total approximately $1.00 per contingent value right if the transactions close in 2017, or $0.84 per contingent value right if the
transactions close in 2018. We expect to be able to file for such tax refunds by the third quarter of 2018, although the payment and distribution of the
cash proceeds from such refunds will likely require additional time and may vary due to factors not within our control.

Immediately prior to the merger, under the asset purchase agreement, NewStar will sell a portfolio of its investment assets, including loans and other
credit investments, to GSO Diamond Portfolio Holdco LLC. The proceeds of the asset sale will be used to pay down outstanding NewStar debt and to
fund a portion of the merger consideration payable by First Eagle. NewStar stockholders will not receive directly any portion of the asset sale proceeds.
Completion of the asset sale and the merger are conditioned on each other, and we will not complete either transaction unless both are completed.

We are holding a special meeting to seek your approval to adopt the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase
agreement.

Our board of directors, by the unanimous vote of all directors voting, has approved the merger agreement, the asset purchase agreement and the
transactions contemplated by such agreements. The board, by the unanimous vote of all directors voting, recommends that stockholders vote
“FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and “FOR” the proposal to approve the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase
agreement.

At the special meeting, stockholders will also be asked to vote on (i) an advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve specified compensation that may be
paid or become payable to the named executive officers of NewStar in connection with the merger and (ii) a proposal to approve the adjournment of the
special meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting to approve the proposals regarding the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement. The board recommends that stockholders vote
“FOR” each of these proposals.

Information about the special meeting, the proposals to be voted on at the meeting and other related matters is contained in the accompanying proxy
statement, which we urge you to read carefully and in its entirety, including the annexes and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in
the proxy statement.

Your vote is very important. The transactions cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock vote
“FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement and “FOR” the approval of the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement. The
failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and “AGAINST” the proposal to
approve the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement.

On behalf of the Board of Directors of
NewStar Financial, Inc.,

 

Timothy J. Conway
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Boston, Massachusetts
November 29, 2017

Neither the SEC nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved either the asset sale or the merger, passed upon the merits or
fairness of either the asset sale or the merger or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in this document. Any representation
to the contrary is a criminal offense.

The accompanying proxy statement is dated November 29, 2017 and is first being mailed to stockholders on or about November 30, 2017.

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

To the Stockholders of NewStar Financial, Inc.:

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that a Special Meeting of the Stockholders of NewStar Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NewStar”) will be held
at the offices of Locke Lord LLP, 111 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, on December 21, 2017, at 10 a.m. local time, for the following
purposes:

1. To consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 16, 2017, by and among NewStar, First Eagle
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, FE Holdco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and FE Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation;

2. To consider and vote on a proposal to approve the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 16, 2017, by and
between NewStar and GSO Diamond Portfolio Holdco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company;

3. To approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of
NewStar in connection with the transactions; and

4. To approve the adjournment of the special meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or the proposal to approve the transactions contemplated
by the asset purchase agreement.

Only holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on November 20, 2017, are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special
meeting or at any postponement or adjournment thereof.

Your vote is very important. The transactions cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock vote “FOR”
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and “FOR” the proposal to approve the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement. Both the
merger proposal and the asset sale proposal must be approved by NewStar’s stockholders in order for the transactions to be completed. The failure to
vote on either of these proposals will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” both proposals.

After reading the accompanying proxy statement, please make sure to vote your shares by proxy promptly by completing, signing and dating the
accompanying proxy card and returning it in the enclosed prepaid envelope or by voting by proxy by telephone or through the Internet by following the
instructions on the accompanying proxy card. If you hold shares through an account with a bank, broker or other nominee, please follow the instructions
you receive from it to vote your shares.

If you have any questions or need assistance in voting your shares of common stock, please contact our proxy solicitor, Georgeson LLC, toll free at

Certain Relationships Among the Parties

For information on relationship among the parties to the transactions listed above and certain of their affiliates, see “The Parties to the
Transactions” beginning on page 21 of this proxy statement and “Additional Information Regarding First Eagle and Corsair” beginning on page
131 of this proxy statement.

The Merger and Asset Sale (page 31)

On October 16, 2017, NewStar entered into:
 

 
•  an Agreement and Plan of Merger as may be amended from time to time, which we refer to as the “merger agreement”, with First

Eagle, FE Holdco and Merger Sub; and
 

 
•  an Asset Purchase Agreement as may be amended from time to time, which we refer to as the “asset purchase agreement”, with the

Asset Buyer.

Under the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into NewStar, which we refer to as the “merger”, with NewStar surviving the
merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of FE Holdco (and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of First Eagle).

Immediately prior to the merger, pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, NewStar will sell a portfolio of its investment assets, including loans
and other credit investments, to the Asset Buyer, which we refer to as the “asset sale”. The purchase price to be paid by the Asset Buyer to NewStar
is $2,370,700,000, which will be subject to adjustment as provided in the asset purchase agreement.

The closing of the merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the closing of the asset sale and will occur immediately following the asset sale.
The net proceeds paid to NewStar by the Asset Buyer in connection with the asset sale will be applied to pay off most of our outstanding debt
obligations and the remainder will be used by First Eagle to pay a portion of the upfront cash merger consideration, as described below. No portion
of the asset sale proceeds will be paid directly to NewStar stockholders, who will be entitled to receive solely the merger consideration described
below.

If the merger is completed, each share of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be entitled to receive (i) $11.44 in cash,
without interest, which we refer to as the “upfront per share cash consideration”, and (ii) one contractual contingent value right, which we refer to
as a “contingent value right” and collectively, with the upfront per share cash consideration, as the “merger consideration”. Shares held by holders
who properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law will not be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration and will instead
have such rights as are granted under applicable Delaware law.

Following the merger, NewStar will become a privately held company, wholly owned by First Eagle, and NewStar’s common stock will be delisted
from the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”.

The Contingent Value Rights (page 92)

Each holder of a contingent value right will have the right to receive a pro-rata share of amounts attributable to certain post-closing U.S. federal
and state income tax refunds received by NewStar as a result of losses recognized upon the closing of the asset sale. These losses may be carried
back to the two taxable years prior to, and interim period ending on, the closing date of the transactions. Under applicable SEC rules, the contingent
value rights may not be sold or transferred (with certain limited exceptions, including transfer by will or intestacy). The contingent value rights will
not represent any equity or ownership interest in NewStar, First Eagle or any of their affiliates (or any other person) and will not be represented by
any certificates or other instruments.

Table of Contents

NewStar currently expects the income tax refunds received to total approximately $41.6 million if the closing occurs in 2017 (which would result
in payments of approximately $1.00 in the aggregate for each contingent value right) or approximately $35.0 million if the closing occurs in the
first quarter of 2018 (which would result in payments of approximately $0.84 in the aggregate for each contingent value right). NewStar currently
expects to be able to file for these refunds by the third quarter of 2018. Such expectations differ from the projections previously prepared by
management that were provided to NewStar’s financial advisors primarily due to management’s updated expectations that NewStar’s full fiscal
year 2017 earnings will be lower than management previously estimated and due to lower estimated state tax refunds as a result of applicable state
alternative minimum tax requirements, as further described in “Special Factors—NewStar’s Current Expectations Regarding the Contingent Value
Rights” on page 77.

The refund filings can only be made after the purchase price for the asset sale is finally determined pursuant to certain post-closing adjustment
procedures and allocated for tax purposes among the purchased assets, as further described in “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase
Agreement—Asset Purchase Agreement—Payment of the Asset Sale Consideration” on page 114.

As further described below, under the merger agreement the holders of the contingent value rights will receive a payment of 30% of each tax refund
(net of certain adjustments) promptly after First Eagle receives such refund and 60% of the net tax refund will be disbursed upon approval by the
Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, which we refer to as the “JCT”, with the remaining amount disbursed upon the earlier of the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and the completion by the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the “IRS”, of any audit
for the applicable tax year.

Under U.S. federal income tax law and regulations, a refund request is generally based on tax loss carrybacks to prior tax years and is generally
processed and paid promptly after the refund claim is filed. However, refund claims exceeding $5 million are subject to review and approval by the
JCT, and if such approval is denied in whole or in part, the disapproved portion must be returned by the taxpayer to the IRS. Accordingly, 70% of
the net tax refund will be retained in an escrow account (with 60% of the net tax refund released upon JCT approval and the remainder released
upon completion of an IRS audit or the expiration of the statute of limitations for the applicable tax years).

Recently proposed tax legislation could adversely affect the availability of tax loss carrybacks—see “—Recent Developments Potentially Affecting
the Contingent Value Rights”, below.

The following table presents the current expectation of NewStar management as to the expected amount, and possible timing, of payments to the
holders of the contingent value rights. However, as such payments are subject to approvals by the IRS, JCT and other taxing authorities and
current tax law (which is subject to change), there can be no assurance that any payment will be made under the contingent value rights,
or the amount or timing of any such payment.

Payments on the Contingent Value Rights

Upon receipt of any such tax refunds, an amount equal to 30% of such refund (net of any increase in U.S. federal income tax liability resulting from
NewStar’s receipt of any state income tax refund), which we refer to as a “net tax refund”, will be promptly disbursed to the holders of the
contingent value rights.

•  the number of contingent value rights then outstanding (which will be deemed to include, as of such payment date, such number
of contingent value rights that would have been issued to stockholders who have properly demanded their statutory rights of
appraisal under applicable Delaware law or who have not properly exchanged their shares for payment of the merger
consideration).

 

 

•  The remainder of such net tax refund will be held in an interest bearing account, which we refer to as the “tax holdback account”, that
will be invested as directed by the CVR Committee (as further described below) in specified short-term, high quality investments. Any
interest earned on the funds in the tax holdback account will be for the benefit of, and any losses will be for the account of, the holders
of the contingent value rights.

As described above, under applicable federal tax law, applications for refunds in excess of $5 million are subject to review and approval by the JCT
before becoming final. Upon any U.S. federal income tax refund described above being approved by the JCT prior to completion of the IRS audit
or the expiration of the statute of limitations for the applicable tax year, an amount equal to 60% of the applicable net tax refund (plus any interest
earned to date on such amount), which we refer to as a “JCT approval payment”, will be promptly disbursed to the holders of the contingent value
rights.
 

 •  At the time of such distribution, each contingent value right will entitle the holder to a payment equal to the quotient of:
 

 •  the amount of the JCT approval payment divided by
 

 •  the number of contingent value rights then outstanding (as calculated as set forth above).
 

 

•  The initial payment will be increased by an amount equal to 60% of any net tax refund for any “quick refund” of NewStar’s estimated
payments of U.S. federal income taxes for the taxable year that ends on the closing date (plus any interest earned to date on such
amount in the tax holdback account). Any such “quick refund” is technically just a reduction in 2017 estimated tax payments and
therefore will not require JCT approval.

The remaining amount of any net tax refund (plus any interest earned to date on such amount) will be promptly disbursed to the holders of the
contingent value rights upon the earlier of: (x) the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the IRS’s review of the tax return for the
taxable year to which such net tax refund relates and (y) the time that the IRS closes its income tax audit of NewStar for the taxable year to which
such net tax refund relates.
 

 •  At the time of such distribution, each contingent value right will entitle the holder to a payment equal to the quotient of:
 •  the amount of the remaining net tax refund payment divided by
 

 •  the number of contingent value rights then outstanding (as calculated as set forth above).

In the event any net tax refund is reduced as a result of a final resolution of liability for any tax by or as a result of any final court decision,
settlement or other “determination” (as further described in “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement—Merger Agreement—
Contingent Value Rights” on page 92), an amount equal to the tax owed will be disbursed to NewStar from the tax holdback account, which may
result in there being no further funds in the tax holdback account to be disbursed to the holders of contingent value rights.

The holders of the contingent value rights will have no obligation or liability to return or otherwise repay to First Eagle or NewStar any amounts
previously disbursed to such holders, even if the funds remaining in the tax holdback account are not sufficient to satisfy in full NewStar’s tax
obligation or liability arising as a result of such determination.

Table of Contents

CVR Committee

Prior to the merger, NewStar will form a committee (comprised of one individual reasonably acceptable to First Eagle), which we refer to as the
“CVR Committee”, with authority to monitor compliance with the foregoing and enforce, on behalf of the holders of the contingent value rights,
the obligations of First Eagle and NewStar with respect thereto.

The CVR Committee will have the right to control any audit, dispute or action with respect to the tax refunds, provided that the CVR Committee
may not settle any such audit, dispute or action without the prior written consent of First Eagle and NewStar.

Any decision of the CVR Committee with respect to the matters set forth above will be binding on all holders of the contingent value rights;
provided, that the holders of at least 25% of the outstanding contingent value rights will be entitled to direct the CVR Committee to act on behalf of
the holders of the contingent value rights to enforce: (A) the preparation of the refund tax returns by the CVR Committee; (B) the filing of such tax
returns by First Eagle; and (C) the deposit by NewStar of the net tax refunds actually received with the CVR Agent. Furthermore, each holder of a
contingent value right is entitled to enforce the right to receive the payments set forth above to which such holder is entitled.

Recent Developments Potentially Affecting the Contingent Value Rights

On November 2, 2017 and November 9, 2017, respectively, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Committee on Finance each
introduced tax reform legislation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which we refer to as the “Tax Bill”. The Tax Bill, if enacted under either
version, would eliminate the ability to carryback net operating losses, which we refer to as “NOLs” arising in tax years beginning after 2017,
subject to limited exceptions not relevant to the contingent value rights. As a result, if the Tax Bill were enacted under either version and the
transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement were to close in 2018, NewStar would not be able to carryback the losses generated in
connection with the closing of the asset sale, and as such, holders of the contingent value rights would not be entitled to any payments thereunder.
On November 16, 2017, the Tax Bill proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee passed in the U.S. House of Representatives, but the Tax
Bill proposed by the Senate Committee on Finance has not yet been voted upon by the full U.S. Senate. If the Senate version is passed by the full
U.S. Senate, both versions of the Tax Bill will go to a joint congressional conference for reconciliation before an agreed-upon version goes back to
both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate for a final vote. There is substantial uncertainty as to whether either version of the Tax
Bill will be enacted or, if enacted, whether the final legislation will limit the carryback of NOLs to the same extent, if at all. Accordingly, holders
are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding this issue.

The Special Meeting (page 23)

The special meeting of the stockholders of NewStar will be held at the offices of Locke Lord LLP, 111 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts,
on December 21, 2017, at 10 a.m. local time, which we refer to as the “special meeting”.

Proposals to Be Voted on at the Special Meeting (page 23)

At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon the following proposals:
 

 •  the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which we refer to as the “merger proposal”;
 

 •  the proposal to approve the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement, which we refer to as the “asset sale proposal”;

Table of Contents

 
•  the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named

executive officers of NewStar in connection with the merger, which we refer to as the “compensation proposal”; and
 

 
•  the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting from time to time, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional

proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposals regarding the merger agreement and the
asset purchase agreement, which we refer to as the “adjournment proposal”.

Record Date, Stockholders Entitled to Vote and Quorum (page 23)

Only holders of record of our shares of common stock as of the close of business on November 20, 2017, which we refer to as the “record date”,
will be entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments thereof. As of the record date, there were 41,555,453
shares of common stock outstanding.

Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote for each share of common stock owned at the close of
business on the record date.

The presence of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, represented in person or by proxy,
constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting. Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be included in the
calculation of the number of shares of common stock considered to be present at the special meeting in determining a quorum. Under our bylaws,
in the absence of a quorum at the special meeting, the meeting of stockholders may be adjourned by the chairman of the special meeting.

Required Vote (page 23)

Merger and Asset Sale Proposals

The merger proposal and the asset sale proposal each requires the affirmative vote of stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote on such proposal.

Compensation and Adjournment Proposals

The compensation proposal and adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of common stock
present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Voting by NewStar’s Directors and Executive Officers (page 24)

At the close of business on the record date for the special meeting, NewStar’s directors and executive officers beneficially owned and had the right
to vote 3,333,053 shares of common stock (excluding, in the cases of our directors Mr. Bradley E. Cooper and Mr. Richard E. Thornburgh, the
4,000,000 shares and 4,263,075 shares owned by certain Capital Z entities and Corsair entities, respectively, which are stockholders of NewStar
and with which such directors are affiliated) which represents approximately 8.0% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote at the special
meeting.

It is expected that NewStar’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares of common stock:
 

 •  “FOR” the merger proposal;
 

 •  “FOR” the asset sale proposal;

Go-Shop and No Solicitation (page 101)

During the period from October 16, 2017 and continuing until 12:01 a.m. (New York time) on November 16, 2017, which we refer to as the
“no-shop period start date”, NewStar had the right to, among other things, solicit proposals or offers that constitute, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an “acquisition proposal” (as further described in “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement—Merger
Agreement—Go-Shop; No Solicitation” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement) for at least 20% of the shares or assets of NewStar and
engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to such proposals or offers, so long as such person is subject to an acceptable
confidentiality agreement. As described further in “Special Factors—Background of the Transactions” beginning on page 31 of this proxy
statement, during the go-shop process NewStar, with the assistance of Credit Suisse and Houlihan Lokey, contacted 53 parties to solicit alternative
transaction proposals and seven other parties made unsolicited inquiries. NewStar entered into confidentiality agreements with 22 of those parties.
NewStar did not receive any acquisition proposals during the go-shop period.

Beginning on the no-shop period start date, NewStar may not solicit any proposals or offers that constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, an acquisition proposal or engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning any such proposals or offers.

Table of Contents

However, NewStar may engage in negotiations or discussions following the no-shop period start date and prior to the approval of the merger
proposal and the asset sale proposal by the NewStar stockholders with any person that provides NewStar:
 

 
•  a written acquisition proposal prior to the no-shop period start date, which proposal the board has determined in good faith is or would

reasonably be expected to lead to a “superior proposal” (as further described in “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase
Agreement—Merger Agreement—Go-Shop; No Solicitation” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement); or

 

 

•  a bona fide written acquisition proposal that was not solicited by NewStar in breach of the non-solicitation provisions, whether before
or after the no-shop period start date, if the board has determined in good faith (i) that such acquisition proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal and (ii) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Termination for a Superior Proposal (page 104)

Prior to the approval of the merger proposal and the asset sale proposal by the NewStar stockholders, NewStar is permitted to terminate the merger
agreement and the asset purchase agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement to effect a superior proposal provided certain conditions
are satisfied. Prior to such termination NewStar must notify First Eagle and the Asset Buyer of such superior proposal and provide them the right to
negotiate with NewStar for five business days (or an additional three business days upon any amendment to such proposal) to make adjustments to
the terms of the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement so that such proposal would cease to be a superior proposal.
 

 

•  NewStar will be obligated to pay, in the aggregate, a $10 million termination fee ($7 million to the Asset Buyer and $3 million to First
Eagle), which we refer to as the “go shop termination fee”, if NewStar terminates the merger agreement and the asset purchase
agreement to enter into a definitive agreement to effect a superior proposal with an “excluded party” (as further described in “The
Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement—Merger Agreement—Go-Shop; No Solicitation” beginning on page 101 of this
proxy statement)..

 

 
•  The go shop termination fee is only payable if First Eagle and the Asset Buyer are notified by NewStar of its intention to accept

such superior proposal no later than fourteen days after the no-shop period start date.
 

 
•  NewStar will be obligated to pay, in the aggregate, a $15 million termination fee ($10.5 million to the Asset Buyer and $4.5 million to

First Eagle) if:
 

 
•  NewStar terminates the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement to enter into a definitive agreement to effect a

superior proposal and the go shop termination fee is not payable; or
 

 
•  the Asset Buyer and First Eagle terminate the merger agreement and asset purchase agreement, respectively, as a result of

NewStar having materially breached the non-solicitation provisions of such agreements or the board having changed its
recommendation with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement.

Other Termination Rights (page 109 and page 121)

The merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement can also each be terminated, subject to certain exception, in the following circumstances:
 

 •  if the closing has not occurred by April 16, 2018, which we refer to as the “end date”;

Table of Contents

 •  if there is a final non-appealable court order or other governmental action permanently prohibiting the closing;
 

 
•  if a party has materially breached its representations, warranties or covenants (and such breach is either not cured within 20 business

days or is not capable of being cured) and, as a result, the non-breaching party is not obligated to close such agreement;
 

 •  if stockholder approval of the merger proposal or the asset sale proposal has not been obtained at the special meeting;
 

 •  if the merger agreement is terminated, then the asset purchase agreement can be terminated; or
 

 •  if the asset purchase agreement is terminated, then the merger agreement can be terminated.

NewStar is also entitled to terminate the asset purchase agreement if the Asset Buyer fails to close the asset sale within three business days after the
date the Asset Buyer is required to close under the asset purchase agreement, as described in further detail in “The Merger Agreement and the
Asset Purchase Agreement—Asset Purchase Agreement—Termination”.

Buyer Termination Fee (page 123)

In the event NewStar terminates the asset purchase agreement as a result of the failure of the Asset Buyer to close when required or as a result of a
material breach by the Asset Buyer of the asset purchase agreement, the Asset Buyer will be obligated to pay to NewStar a termination fee of
$25 million, which we refer to as the “buyer termination fee”.

Following the date of the asset purchase agreement, the general partner of the GSO Fund (and any feeder funds thereof) called $30 million of
capital from the limited partners thereof and, upon receipt of such capital, deposited such amount with a third party bank subject to the terms of a
control agreement as further described below.

The GSO Fund has provided a limited guarantee of the Asset Buyer’s obligation to pay the buyer termination fee and therefore, if the buyer
termination fee is due, such funds will be used to pay the buyer termination fee. Such funds may also be used to pay the costs and expenses
incurred by NewStar in connection with assisting the Asset Buyer in its efforts to obtain the required financing under the asset purchase agreement.
The GSO Fund and NewStar entered into a control agreement with such bank under which funds cannot be disbursed from the account without
joint instruction from NewStar and the GSO Fund.

In the event the $30 million is withdrawn from the designated account subject to the control agreement in violation of the asset purchase
agreement, NewStar will have the right to terminate the asset purchase agreement and in such a circumstance the Asset Buyer will be obligated to
pay NewStar the buyer termination fee (and the GSO Fund, as described above, has guaranteed payment of such fee). The general partner of the
GSO Fund (and any feeder funds thereof) has assigned to NewStar the right to call capital from its limited partners in such a circumstance in an
amount sufficient to pay such fee and related expenses.

Financing (page 79)

First Eagle’s obligations under the merger agreement are not subject to any financing condition. First Eagle will use the proceeds from the asset
sale, and other cash available to NewStar at closing, to pay a portion of the upfront merger consideration, with any remaining amount required to
make such payments to be funded by First Eagle with its available cash on hand or borrowings under its existing credit facilities.

Table of Contents

In addition, while the Asset Buyer’s obligations under the asset purchase agreement are not subject to any financing condition, concurrently with
the signing of the asset purchase agreement:
 

 

•  a wholly owned subsidiary of the Asset Buyer entered into a debt commitment letter with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which we refer to as
“Wells Fargo”, providing for acquisition financing under a secured revolving credit facility of up to $1.6 billion and a debt commitment
letter with CDPQ Fixed Income V Inc., which we refer to as “CDPQ”, an affiliate of Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec,
providing for acquisition financing of a term loan of at least $225 million, such commitment letters, which we refer to as the “debt
commitment letters”, and such debt financings, which we refer to as the “debt facility”; and

 

 
•  the Asset Buyer entered into an equity commitment letter, which we refer to as the “equity commitment letter”, with the GSO Fund, a

newly-created investment fund managed by GSO, providing for equity financing of up to $850 million.

The GSO Fund was formed for the purpose of the asset sale and it has obtained commitments from its limited partners of $850 million for the
closing of the asset sale to pay the purchase price. The general partner of the GSO Fund has assigned to NewStar the right, under certain
circumstances, to issue capital contribution notices to the limited partners of the GSO Fund (and of any feeder fund thereof) and to seek to cause
such limited partners to contribute capital to the GSO Fund (and any feeder fund thereof) in accordance with the terms of the limited partnership
agreement of the GSO Fund (and any feeder fund thereof).

The funding of the debt financing is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the debt commitment letters and the funding of the
equity financing (and right of NewStar to issue capital contribution notices to the limited partners of the GSO Fund (and of any feeder fund
thereof)) is subject to the conditions set forth in the equity commitment letter and assignment agreement, respectively, each as further described in
“Special Factors—Financing of the Transactions” beginning on page 79 of this proxy statement.

When the Merger Becomes Effective (page 108)

We anticipate completing the merger and the asset sale by the first quarter of 2018, subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions as described
in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement—Merger Agreement—Conditions to Closing” beginning on
page 108 of this proxy statement and the section entitled “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement—Asset Purchase Agreement
—Conditions to Closing ” beginning on page 120 of this proxy statement.

Recommendation of NewStar’s Board of Directors (page 41)

Our board has, by the unanimous vote of all directors voting:
 

 
•  determined that the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated by such agreements are

advisable and in the best interests of NewStar and its stockholders;

unaffiliated securityholders;
 

 
•  adopted resolutions approving the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated by such

agreements and declared the advisability of the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated
by such agreements; and

 

 
•  resolved to recommend that the stockholders of NewStar adopt the merger agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set

forth in the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated

by the asset purchase agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the asset purchase agreement and directed that
such matters be submitted to NewStar’s stockholders at the special meeting for their approval.

The board, by the unanimous vote of all directors voting, recommends that the stockholders of NewStar vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR”
the asset sale proposal, “FOR” the compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

For a description of the reasons considered by the board in deciding to recommend approval of the merger proposal and the asset sale proposal, see
“Special Factors—Recommendation of the NewStar Board and Its Reasons for the Transactions; Fairness of the Transactions” beginning on page
41 of this proxy statement.

Opinions of NewStar’s Financial Advisors (page 54)

Opinion of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC

NewStar has engaged Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, which we refer to as “Credit Suisse”, to act as a financial advisor to NewStar in
connection with the proposed transaction. In connection with this engagement, Credit Suisse delivered an opinion, dated October 16, 2017, to the
board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of such opinion, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of
NewStar common stock (other than excluded holders (as defined below) and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement. For
purposes of Credit Suisse’s analyses and opinion, the term (i) “transaction” refers to, collectively, the merger and the asset sale and (ii) “excluded
holders” refers to, collectively, certain investors in First Eagle Investment Management, LLC, including Corsair, Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder
Holdings Inc., which we refer to as “Bleichroeder”, and Blackstone, First Eagle Investment Management, LLC, First Eagle, FE Holdco and their
respective investors, and certain other parties involved in the transaction and related transactions, and/or certain of their respective affiliates,
portfolio companies, sub-advisors, managers and/or managed or related entities, including GSO Capital Partners LP and FS Investment

Houlihan Lokey’s opinion was directed to the board (in its capacity as such) and only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view,
to the holders of common stock of the merger consideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the merger agreement in
connection with the transaction and did not address any other aspect or implication of the transaction or any portion or aspect of the
transaction, any related transaction or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection therewith or
otherwise. The summary of Houlihan Lokey’s opinion in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of its

this proxy statement are intended to be, and do not constitute, advice or a recommendation to the board, any security holder of NewStar or
any other person as to how to act or vote with respect to any matter relating to the transaction or any portion or aspect of the transaction
or otherwise.

Treatment of Employee Stock Options and Restricted Stock (page 92)

Under the merger agreement, outstanding equity-based awards issued by NewStar will be treated at the effective time of the merger as follows:

Stock Options. At the effective time of the merger, each option granted by NewStar to purchase shares of NewStar common stock under its 2006
Incentive Plan, whether or not vested, which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time, will be cancelled, and in
consideration for such cancelled option, the holder thereof will be entitled to receive (less applicable withholding taxes) (a) a cash payment equal to
the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the upfront per share consideration over the exercise price per share of common stock subject to such option
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such option and (b) one contingent value right for each share of common
stock subject to such option.

Restricted Stock. At the effective time of the merger, each share of common stock that is subject to vesting (whether time-based, performance-based
or otherwise), which we refer to as “restricted stock”, will be cancelled, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive in consideration for each
such cancelled share (less applicable withholding taxes) (i) a cash payment equal to the upfront per share consideration and (ii) one contingent
value right.

Treatment of Warrants (page 92)

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding NewStar warrant to purchase shares of common stock will become exercisable solely for the
merger consideration in accordance with the terms of such warrant and continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set
forth in the applicable warrant in effect immediately prior to the merger.

Interests of NewStar’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions (page 82)

In considering the recommendation of the board that you vote “FOR” the proposals to be considered and voted on at the special meeting, you
should be aware that some of our directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our
stockholders generally. The board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in reaching its decision to approve the
merger agreement and asset purchase agreement and recommend that our stockholders approve the merger proposal and the asset sale proposal.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 85)

The receipt of cash and contingent value rights by U.S. holders of shares of common stock will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. The amount of gain or loss a holder recognizes, and the timing and potentially the character of a portion of such gain or loss, depends in
part on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the contingent value rights with respect to which there is substantial uncertainty. For a more
complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, see the section entitled “Special Factors—Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 85 of this proxy statement. You should consult your own tax advisor about the tax
consequences (including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws) to you of the merger in light of your
particular circumstances.

Regulatory Approvals (page 88)

Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until notifications have been given and
information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and all statutory
waiting period requirements have been satisfied or early termination has been granted by the applicable agencies. On October 30, 2017, BCP CC
Holdings, L.P., which is the “ultimate parent entity” of First Eagle under the HSR Act and rules thereunder, NewStar and the Asset Buyer filed
their respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC, and the Antitrust Division and the FTC granted early
termination of the applicable waiting period on November 21, 2017.

Rights of Appraisal (page 139)

Under Delaware law, holders of shares of our common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who properly
demand appraisal of their shares of common stock and who otherwise comply with all the requirements of Section 262 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, which we refer to as the “DGCL”, will be entitled to seek appraisal of, and obtain payment in cash for the judicially
determined fair value of, their shares of common stock in lieu of receiving the merger consideration if the merger is completed. This value could be
more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration.

Any holder of shares of common stock intending to exercise appraisal rights, among other things, must submit a written demand for appraisal to us
prior to the vote on the merger proposal, must not vote in favor of the merger proposal and must otherwise strictly comply with all of the
procedures required by Delaware law. The relevant provisions of the DGCL are included as Annex E to this proxy statement. You are encouraged
to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety. If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee
and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate
procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such bank, brokerage firm or nominee. Moreover, due to the complexity of the procedures
for exercising the right to seek appraisal, stockholders who are considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel. Failure to strictly comply with these provisions may result in the loss of the right of appraisal.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT
THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE TRANSACTIONS

The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the special meeting. These questions and answers may not
address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder of NewStar. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this
proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, as well as any
amendments thereto or other related documents filed with the SEC.

 
Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
 

A: On October 16, 2017, NewStar entered into the merger agreement with First Eagle and the asset purchase agreement with the Asset Buyer. You are
receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the board in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement
and approve the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement, along with the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting.

 
Q: What is a quorum?
 

A: A quorum will be present if holders of a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding on the record date are present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed
from time to time until a quorum is obtained.

If you hold the shares of common stock in your own name and submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the
proposals listed on the proxy card, your shares will be counted for purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.

If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not tell the nominee how to vote your shares, these
shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the special meeting.

 
Q: How does the board recommend that I vote?
 

A: The board, by the unanimous vote of all directors voting, recommends that our stockholders vote: “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the asset
sale proposal, “FOR” the compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

 
Q: What effects will the transactions have on NewStar?
 

A: Shares of our common stock are currently registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”, and are
listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “NEWS”. As a result of the merger, NewStar will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be wholly
owned by First Eagle.

Following the consummation of the merger, the registration of shares of our common stock and our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act
will be terminated. In addition, upon the consummation of the merger, shares of our common stock will no longer be listed on any stock exchange
or quotation system, including NASDAQ.

 
Q: Is the merger expected to be taxable to owners of our common stock?
 

A: In general, your receipt of the cash and contingent value rights in exchange for each of your shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will
be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and

Table of Contents

 

may be a taxable transaction under state, local or non-U.S. income or other tax laws. The amount of gain or loss you recognize, and the timing of
such gain or loss, depends in part on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the contingent value rights, with respect to which there is substantial
uncertainty. Your gain or loss will also be determined by the tax basis in your shares of common stock. You should read “Special Factors—
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 85 of this proxy statement for a discussion of the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger. You should also consult your tax advisor on the tax consequences of the merger in light of your particular
circumstances.

 
Q: What will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory proposal on executive compensation payable to NewStar’s named executive

officers in connection with the merger?
 

A: The approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the transaction. The SEC rules require NewStar to seek approval on a
non-binding, advisory basis of certain payments that will or may be made to NewStar’s named executive officers in connection with the merger.
The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on NewStar or First Eagle. If both the merger proposal and asset sale
proposal are approved by our stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to NewStar’s named
executive officers even if stockholders fail to approve this proposal.

 
Q: What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of common stock?
 

A: We urge you to read this proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents referred to as incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement, and to consider how the transactions affect you. Your vote is important. If you are a stockholder of record, you can ensure that your
shares are voted at the special meeting by submitting your proxy via:

 

 •  mail, using the enclosed postage-paid envelope;
 

 
•  telephone, by calling toll-free 1-800-PROXIES (1-800-776-9437) in the United States or 1-718-921-8500 from foreign countries and

following the recorded instructions; or
 

 •  the Internet, by accessing the website www.voteproxy.com and following the instructions on the website.

If you intend to submit your proxy by telephone or over the Internet, you must do so by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the day before the
special meeting. If you intend to submit your proxy by mail, your completed proxy card must be received prior to the special meeting.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee you should follow the directions provided by your broker, bank
or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares will
not be voted, which will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the merger proposal and “AGAINST” the asset sale proposal. Even if you
plan to attend the special meeting, to ensure that your shares of common stock are voted, please submit a proxy to vote your shares of common
stock by marking, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card or by using the telephone number printed on your proxy card or by using
the Internet voting instructions printed on your proxy card.

 
Q: Can I revoke my proxy?
 

A: Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke
your proxy by:

 

 
•  delivering to NewStar’s Corporate Secretary in writing at NewStar Financial, Inc., Attn: Corporate Secretary, 500 Boylston Street, Suite

1250, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of the proxy, stating that the
proxy is revoked and that is received by NewStar’s Corporate Secretary prior to the special meeting;

Table of Contents

 
•  attending the special meeting and voting in person (your attendance at the meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy; you must also vote

in person at the special meeting);
 

 
•  signing and delivering a new proxy relating to the same shares of common stock and bearing a later date and that is received prior to the

special meeting; or
 

 •  submitting a new proxy by telephone or over the Internet by 11:59 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on the day before the special meeting.

Please note that if you hold your shares of common stock in “street name” and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your
shares, the above-described options for revoking your voting instructions do not apply, and instead you must follow the instructions received from
your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your voting instructions.

 
Q: What happens if I do not vote?
 

A: The vote to approve each of the merger proposal and the asset sale proposal is based on the total number of shares of common stock outstanding
on the record date, not just the shares of common stock that are voted. If you do not vote, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
proposal to approve the asset sale and adopt the merger agreement.

The vote to approve each of the compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal is based on the total number of shares of common stock
present, in person or by proxy, at the special meeting. Therefore, if you do not vote, and assuming a quorum is present for the special meeting,
your failure to vote will have no effect on the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal.

 
Q: What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?
 

A: If your shares of common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card or
voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards or voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies
by telephone or the Internet, if available to you) to ensure that all of your shares are voted.

 
Q: Will my shares of common stock held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares

I hold of record?
 

A: No. Because any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares you hold of record,
any shares of common stock so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record and you will need to submit separate
proxy cards or voting instruction cards for each. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as
trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of common
stock because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be
voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares of common stock held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules
governing the account.

 
Q: What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the merger?
 

A: If you transfer your shares of common stock, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger. In order to
receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock immediately prior to the consummation of the merger.

The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the date on which the merger will be consummated. So, if
you transfer your shares of common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, you will have transferred your right to receive the
merger consideration in the merger, but retained the right to vote at the special meeting.

Table of Contents

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
 

A: No, do not send in your certificates now. After the merger is completed, if you hold shares of common stock represented by certificates, you will
receive a letter of transmittal from the paying agent for the merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock
for the merger consideration and if you hold book-entry shares you will receive a check or wire transfer for the merger consideration with respect
to such shares. If your shares of common stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions
from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in
exchange for the merger consideration.

 
Q: I do not know where my stock certificate is – how will I get the merger consideration for my shares?
 

A: If the merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the merger will include the procedures that you must
follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate. This will include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock
certificate. You may also be required to provide a customary indemnity agreement in order to cover any potential loss.

 
Q: What is householding and how does it affect me?
 

A: The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless contrary
instructions have been received, but only if the applicable stockholder provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, each
stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for
beneficial owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you may have
already received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional
copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral
request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.

 
Q: Who can help answer my other questions?
 

A: If you have more questions about the transactions, or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares of common stock or need
additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact Georgeson LLC, which we refer to as “Georgeson”, which is
acting as the proxy solicitation agent for NewStar in connection with the transactions.

If your broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares of common stock in “street name”, you should also call your broker, bank or other
nominee for additional information.

Georgeson, NewStar’s proxy solicitor, may be contacted at: (866) 695-6078.

by the use of the words “believe”, “expect”, “may”, “could”, “should”, “plan”, “project”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “estimate”, “will”, “contemplate”,
“would” and similar expressions that contemplate future events. Such forward-looking statements are based on management’s reasonable current
assumptions and expectations, including the expected completion and timing of the transactions and other information relating to the transactions. You
should be aware that forward-looking statements involve a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ
materially from such forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are
reasonable, we cannot assure you that the actual results or developments we anticipate will be realized, or even if realized, that they will have the
expected effects on the business or operations of NewStar. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which the statements were
made and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements made in this proxy statement or elsewhere as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition to other factors and matters contained in or incorporated by reference in
this document, we believe the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements:
 

 •  failure to obtain the required vote of NewStar’s stockholders;
 

 •  the timing to consummate the transactions;
 

 
•  the risk that a condition to the closing of either the merger or the asset sale may not be satisfied or that the closing of the transactions might

otherwise not occur;
 

 
•  the risk that a regulatory approval that may be required for the asset sale or the merger is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions

that are not anticipated;
 

 •  the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the transaction agreements;
 

 •  the failure of the Asset Buyer to obtain the necessary financing;
 

 •  the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against NewStar and others relating to the transaction agreements;
 

 •  the failure to obtain any income tax refund on which the value of the contingent value rights are based, due to a change in law or otherwise;
 

 •  the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues;
 

 
•  risk that the transactions and their announcement could have an adverse effect on NewStar’s stock price, on its ability to retain customers

and retain and hire key personnel; and
 

 
•  other risk factors as detailed from time to time in NewStar’s reports filed with the SEC, including NewStar’s annual report on Form 10-K,

periodic quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, periodic current reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed with the SEC. The foregoing list
of important factors is not exclusive. See “Where You Can Find Additional Information” beginning on page 146 of this proxy statement.

Many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in
the forward-looking statements contained herein, readers of this proxy statement should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which
reflect management’s views only as of the date hereof. We cannot guarantee any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.

At the special meeting, our stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following matters.
 

 •  the merger proposal;
 

 •  the asset sale proposal;
 

 •  the compensation proposal; and
 

 •  the adjournment proposal.

Our stockholders must approve both the merger proposal and the asset sale proposal in order for the transaction to occur. If our stockholders fail to
approve the merger proposal or the asset sale proposal, then neither the merger nor the asset sale will occur.

Record Date and Quorum

Only holders of record of shares of common stock as of the close of business on November 20, 2017, which is the record date for the special meeting,
will be entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting or any adjournments thereof. As of the record date, there were 41,555,453 shares
of common stock outstanding.

Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote for each share of common stock owned at the close of
business on the record date.

The presence of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, represented in person or by proxy at the
special meeting, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting. Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be included
in the calculation of the number of shares of common stock considered to be present at the special meeting in determining a quorum. In the absence of a
quorum at the special meeting, the meeting of stockholders may be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a majority of
the voting power of the shares represented at the meeting.

Required Vote for Approval

Merger and Asset Sale Proposals

The merger proposal and the asset sale proposal each requires the affirmative vote of stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote on such proposal.

Compensation and Adjournment Proposals

The compensation proposal and adjournment proposal each requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present,
in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Effects of Failing to Vote and Abstentions; Broker Non-Votes

Failing to vote either in person or by proxy at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger proposal and
“AGAINST” the asset sale proposal, but such failure to vote (assuming a quorum is present for the special meeting) will have no effect on the
compensation proposal or adjournment proposal.

Abstaining from voting on a proposal at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” such proposal.

An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting on one or more proposals.
Abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of common stock represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining
whether a quorum has been achieved.

Under applicable rules, brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of common stock in “street name” for a beneficial owner of those shares
typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However,
brokers, banks or other nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to the approval of matters that are “non-routine”
without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. All proposals to be voted on by you at the special meeting are “non-routine” matters, and
therefore brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the proposals. Broker non-votes occur when a broker, bank or other nominee is
not instructed by the beneficial owner of shares to vote on a particular proposal for which the broker does not have discretionary voting power.
Accordingly, there can be no broker non-votes at the special meeting, so failure to provide instructions to your broker or other nominee on how to vote
will result in your shares not being counted as present at the meeting.

Voting by NewStar’s Directors and Executive Officers and by Corsair

At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of NewStar were entitled to vote 3,333,053 shares of common stock
(excluding, in the cases of our directors Messrs. Cooper and Thornburgh, the 4,000,000 shares and 4,263,075 shares owned by certain Capital Z entities
and Corsair entities, respectively, which are stockholders of NewStar and with which such directors are affiliated), or approximately 8.0% of the shares
of common stock outstanding on that date.

We currently expect that NewStar’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares of common stock “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the
asset sale proposal and “FOR” the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although none of them is obligated to do so.

Subject to receipt of approval from the Corsair limited partners advisory committee, the Corsair entities holding 4,263,075 shares of NewStar common
stock intend to vote in favor of the merger and asset sale.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation

Attendance

All holders of shares of common stock as of the close of business on the record date for voting at the special meeting, including stockholders of record
and beneficial owners of common stock registered in the “street name” of a bank, broker or other nominee, are invited to attend the special meeting. If
you are a stockholder of record, please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver’s license. If you hold your shares of common stock
in “street name”, you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or voting instruction form provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee or other similar evidence of ownership, along with proper identification.

Voting in Person

Stockholders of record will be able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record, but instead hold your shares of
common stock in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must provide a proxy executed in your favor from your bank, broker or
other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the special meeting.

Submitting a Proxy or Providing Voting Instructions

To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy or
voting instruction form, even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person.

Shares Held by Record Holder. If you are a stockholder of record as of the record date, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the
methods described below.
 

 

•  Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for submitting
voting instructions. You may vote by proxy by telephone by calling toll-free 1-800-PROXIES (1-800-776-9437) in the United States or 1-
718-921-8500 from foreign countries and following the recorded instructions or via the Internet, by accessing the website
www.voteproxy.com and following the instructions on the website. Your shares will be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had
completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy card, as described below. If you are submitting a proxy by telephone or over the Internet,
your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time the day before the special meeting.

 

 
•  Submit a Proxy Card. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in time for the special

meeting, your shares will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card.

Shares Held in “Street Name”. If your shares are held by a bank, broker or other nominee on your behalf in “street name”, your bank, broker or other
nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your shares by proxy. Many banks and brokerage firms have a process
for their customers to provide voting instructions by telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by proxy card.

Revocation of Proxies

Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it at any time before it is voted. If you are a stockholder of
record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting by:
 

 
•  by delivering to NewStar’s Corporate Secretary in writing at NewStar Financial, Inc., Attn: Secretary, 500 Boylston Street, Suite 1250,

Boston, Massachusetts 02116 a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of the proxy, stating that the proxy is
revoked and that is received by NewStar’s corporate secretary prior to the special meeting;

 

 
•  by attending the special meeting and voting in person (your attendance at the meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy; you must also

vote in person at the special meeting);
 

 
•  by signing and delivering a new proxy relating to the same shares of common stock and bearing a later date and that is received prior to the

special meeting; or
 

 •  by submitting a new proxy by telephone or over the Internet by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the day before the special meeting.

Table of Contents

Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions described above will
not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to NewStar or by sending a written notice
of revocation to NewStar, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by
NewStar before the special meeting.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to you by your bank,
broker or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit new voting instructions.

Adjournments and Postponements

The special meeting may be adjourned or postponed one or more times to a later date or time if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional
proxies in favor of the merger proposal and/or asset sale proposal. If a quorum is present and this adjournment proposal is approved, the special meeting
could be adjourned by the board if there are not sufficient votes at that time to approve the merger proposal or the asset sale proposal. In addition, even
if there is not a quorum present at the special meeting, under our bylaws the special meeting may be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting or by
vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares represented at the meeting.

In addition, the board could postpone the special meeting before it commences, whether for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies or for other
reasons specified in the merger agreement, including to the extent that such postponement or adjournment is necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment is provided to the stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the special meeting.

Any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting will allow NewStar’s stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at
any time prior to their use at the special meeting (as it may be adjourned or postponed).

Solicitation of Proxies

The board is soliciting your proxy, and we will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. This includes the charges and expenses of brokerage firms and others
for forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners of shares of our outstanding common stock. Georgeson, a proxy solicitation firm, has been
retained to assist it in the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting and we will pay Georgeson approximately $8,500, plus reimbursement of
out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may be solicited by mail, personal interview, e-mail, telephone, or via the Internet by Georgeson or, without additional
compensation, by certain of NewStar’s directors, officers and employees.

Other Information

You should not return your stock certificate or send documents representing your shares of common stock with the proxy card. If the merger is
completed, the paying agent for the merger will send you a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock for the
merger consideration.

Questions and Additional Information

If you have more questions about the transaction or how to submit your proxy, or if you need additional copies of this proxy statement or the enclosed
proxy card or voting instructions, please call our proxy solicitor, Georgeson toll-free at (866) 695-6078.

PROPOSAL 3: COMPENSATION PROPOSAL

NewStar’s stockholders are being asked to consider and vote upon a proposal for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the payment by NewStar of
certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of NewStar that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger
and asset sale, as disclosed in the section entitled “Special Factors—Interests of NewStar’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions—
Golden Parachute Compensation”, beginning on page 83, including the table entitled “Golden Parachute Payments” and accompanying footnotes. This
proposal, commonly known as “say-on-golden parachutes”, and which we refer to as the “compensation proposal”, gives NewStar’s stockholders the
opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the compensation that the named executive officers may be entitled to receive from NewStar
that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger and asset sale. This compensation is summarized in the table and footnotes thereto under “Special
Factors—Interests of NewStar’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions”, beginning on page 82 of this proxy statement.

As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon NewStar, First Eagle or the board, and approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion
of the merger or the asset sale. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger proposal and the asset sale proposal and vote not to approve the
compensation proposal (and vice versa). Because the transaction-related executive compensation to be paid in connection with the transactions is based
on the terms of the merger agreement as well as the contractual arrangements with the named executive officers, such compensation will be payable,
regardless of the outcome of this advisory vote, if the merger proposal and asset sale proposal are approved (subject only to the contractual conditions
applicable thereto).

However, NewStar seeks your support and believes that your support is appropriate because NewStar has a comprehensive executive compensation
program designed to link the compensation of our executives with NewStar’s performance and the interests of NewStar’s stockholders. Accordingly, the
board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement and
vote on the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of NewStar Financial, Inc. approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation that may be paid or
become payable to the named executive officers of NewStar Financial, Inc. that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger and asset sale, as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K under the heading “Special Factors—Interests of NewStar’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Transactions—Golden Parachute Compensation”, beginning on page 83 (which disclosure includes the Golden Parachute Compensation
Table required pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K).”

The above resolution approving the merger-related compensation of NewStar’s named executive officers on an advisory basis will require the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote
thereon.

The board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the compensation proposal.

PROPOSAL 4: ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL

NewStar’s stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give us authority to adjourn the special meeting from time to time, if necessary
or appropriate, for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the merger proposal or the asset sale proposal if there are not sufficient votes at
the time of the special meeting to approve both proposals.

If there is a quorum present at the special meeting and this proposal is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned to a later date or time for the
purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the merger proposal or asset sale proposal if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting. If there is not a quorum present at the special meeting, under our by-laws the special meeting may be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting
or by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon.
In addition, the board could postpone the special meeting before it commences, whether for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies or for other
reasons.

If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to
their use.

Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by
proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon.

The board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

SPECIAL FACTORS

Overview

NewStar is seeking stockholder approval for the merger proposal and the asset sale proposal. Under the merger agreement, NewStar will be acquired by
a subsidiary of First Eagle and holders of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the merger will be entitled to receive for each
share, except for certain shares as set forth in the merger agreement, (i) $11.44 in cash, without interest and (ii) one contingent value right. Immediately
prior to the merger, under the asset purchase agreement, NewStar will sell a portfolio of its investment assets, including loans and other credit
investments, to the Asset Buyer. The proceeds of the asset sale will be used to pay down outstanding NewStar debt and to fund a portion of the merger
consideration payable by First Eagle. NewStar stockholders will not receive directly any portion of the asset sale proceeds. Completion of the asset sale
and the merger are conditioned on each other, and we will not complete either transaction unless both are completed.

The Board, by the unanimous vote of all directors voting, has approved the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement and recommends that
stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal and “FOR” the asset sale proposal.

Following the completion of the merger, NewStar’s shares of common stock will no longer be traded on NASDAQ or any other public market. In
addition, the registration of shares of NewStar common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated.

Background of the Transactions

NewStar’s board and senior management team have regularly reviewed and evaluated the company’s operations, performance, prospects and strategic
direction. In connection with these reviews, and with the assistance of our financial and legal advisors, our board and management have regularly
considered potential strategic alternatives, including possible acquisitions, divestitures, recapitalizations and business combinations, with the goal of
maximizing stockholder value. In addition, from time to time, and as noted below, NewStar has solicited and received inquiries from third parties
regarding potential business combination transactions.

In early 2013 (including at a February board meeting), our board discussed in depth NewStar’s strategic position and alternatives and the potential
benefits of pursuing a sale of the company. In July 2013, our board held a retreat with our senior management team to discuss NewStar’s strategic
position and alternatives. Representatives of NewStar’s financial advisor, Credit Suisse, its outside special counsel, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, and its
outside general counsel, Locke Lord, were also present at the meeting. The discussion covered the factors that had affected NewStar’s operations since
the financial crisis including the substantial contraction of the securitization markets and other wholesale funding sources for NewStar’s business, which
had resulted in higher costs of capital and lower leverage; the entry of other non-bank lenders into NewStar’s core markets; and the impact of the Dodd-
Frank Act on the lending and funding markets, particularly the collateralized loan obligation (CLO) markets and the related risk retention requirements
applicable to securitization sponsors.

The discussion also covered the steps NewStar had taken over the prior several years to diversify its revenue and funding sources, including acquiring an
asset-based lending business in 2010, launching an equipment finance business in 2011 and unsuccessfully attempting to acquire a bank in 2009.
NewStar had also taken steps to streamline its operations and reduce its expense base. The board concluded, however, that despite these initiatives the
trading price of our common stock did not reflect the intrinsic value of the company at that time.

The board then considered a range of potential strategic alternatives with input from NewStar’s legal and financial advisors, including whether to initiate
a sale process, try again to acquire a bank or execute on the standalone business plan. The board concluded that in light of the fundamental changes to
the lending and

Table of Contents

funding markets that affected NewStar’s business model, the best way to maximize stockholder value would be to explore a business combination for
the company. Accordingly, the board determined that it was advisable to initiate a sale process and authorized management to begin such a process with
the assistance of Credit Suisse, which the board determined to engage given, among other things, Credit Suisse’s qualifications, experience and
reputation, as well as its familiarity with NewStar and its business. This engagement lapsed following the conclusion of the 2013 process which did not
ultimately result in a transaction.

Starting in mid September 2013, in accordance with the directives of the board, Credit Suisse, on behalf of NewStar, began an outreach to prospective
buyers. Over 60 potential bidders were contacted, including banks, diversified finance companies, private equity firms, direct lending firms and
insurance companies. Sixteen companies signed confidentiality agreements with NewStar. Several of the companies that were contacted expressed an
unwillingness to further consider a transaction with NewStar due to unfavorable changes in bank regulation (particularly the leveraged lending guidance
then-recently released by the OCC, FDIC and Federal Reserve). On September 18, 2013, Bloomberg reported that NewStar was working with Credit
Suisse in a sale process. In November 2013, NewStar received preliminary indications of interest from two potential buyers – a large, foreign-based
bank and a non-bank commercial lender. Both of these indications were withdrawn in January 2014, in one case due to expressed valuation concerns and
in the other due to expressed concerns about the changes in the bank regulations applicable to leveraged lending released several months earlier.

After the conclusion of the 2013 sale process, management and the board again reassessed NewStar’s strategic position and considered a variety of
alternatives to improve its profitability, including a greater focus on asset management activities and platform scale as well as options to reorganize as a
publicly traded partnership to reduce corporate taxes. During this period NewStar also engaged in discussions with various other parties, including GSO,
about potential business combinations or other transactions.

During the summer of 2014, GSO approached NewStar to discuss a variety of strategic alternatives, one of which was a possible transaction involving
an equity investment in NewStar and a strategic cooperation arrangement between GSO and its affiliates and NewStar, including co-lending
opportunities for each to participate in loans originated by the other and GSO providing anchor investments in future credit funds or CLOs sponsored by
NewStar.

The NewStar board met on September 16, 2014 to consider this proposal. The board discussed how the investment and ongoing strategic cooperation
with GSO could allow NewStar to accelerate growth of its asset management business, which was a growth strategy that had been under consideration
by the board. In light of the results of the 2013 sale process and the board’s and management’s subsequent decision to emphasize development of the
asset management platform, the board concluded that the proposed GSO arrangements were consistent with advancing NewStar’s business strategy, and
beneficial to enhancing stockholder value. Negotiations among the parties continued through September and October 2014.

On November 4, 2014, NewStar entered into an investment agreement with three investment funds advised by Franklin Square Capital Partners and
sub-advised by an affiliate of GSO. The investment agreement provided for the investors to purchase $300 million principal amount of 10-year
subordinated notes issued by NewStar and warrants to purchase 12 million shares of NewStar’s common stock at $12.62 per share, which was
approximately 25% of the then current total outstanding shares. The warrants contain a provision limiting their exercisability to 4.99% of NewStar’s
outstanding common stock unless the warrantholders provide NewStar with at least 61 days prior notice of their election for the warrants to be
exercisable for a higher number of shares. The first stage of the transaction closed in December 2014, and the remaining warrants and subordinated
notes were issued in January 2015.

Throughout 2015 NewStar focused on accelerating the growth of its asset management business, including closing a $400 million managed credit fund
in January 2015, with anchor investments from funds sponsored by Franklin Square and sub-advised by GSO, acquiring a credit manager with
$2.3 billion in assets under management in October 2015 and developing the relationship with GSO to increase asset origination.

Although NewStar continued to increase its net income and its earnings per share from 2014, NewStar’s return on equity remained low and our share
price continued to decline, reaching a low of $4.25 per share in February 2016.

At a board meeting on May 11, 2016, Mr. Conway summarized the challenging market conditions in leveraged finance and reported that GSO had
reached out to him to discuss the possibility of exploring a going private transaction involving management and likely other parties. Mr. Conway stated
that he informed GSO that before proceeding he would obtain the board’s authorization to explore a possible transaction, which would include equity
participation by NewStar management and likely Corsair and Capital Z as well. After discussion, the independent directors were supportive of
management proceeding in this manner with a potential going-private transaction.

Discussions among GSO, management, Corsair and Capital Z continued until the summer of 2016, when they were terminated due to a lack of
agreement among such parties on the terms of a potential transaction. Management continued exploring a potential transaction, in consultation with
GSO, for the remainder of 2016 and into early 2017. During that time period NewStar management had preliminary contact or meetings with over 20
parties to solicit their interest in investing in an acquisition of, or acquiring, NewStar.

Mr. Conway provided the board with periodic updates regarding management’s exploration of a potential going-private transaction, including at a board
meeting on February 24, 2017. However, management discussions with potential investors did not result in any agreement on the terms of a proposed
transaction or commitment by investors to provide the necessary capital to finance a transaction, and by the spring of 2017 any ongoing consideration of
a going-private transaction was terminated.

Subsequently, Mr. Conway was introduced by a senior Corsair executive to Mehdi Mahmud, chief executive officer of First Eagle, and NewStar and
First Eagle began discussions regarding the potential benefit of combining NewStar’s leveraged loan asset management platform with First Eagle’s
traditional investment asset management business. These discussions expanded to include the possibility of GSO sponsoring a fund to acquire
NewStar’s loan and investment portfolio in order to facilitate a combination of the NewStar and First Eagle asset management businesses.

On April 13, 2017, our board met, with members of senior management and representatives of Credit Suisse, Simpson Thacher and Locke Lord
participating in the meeting. Senior management provided an overview of a new potential transaction in which one or more institutional investors would
provide the financing for a newly-formed fund managed by GSO to acquire substantially all of NewStar’s loan portfolio and other assets and,
concurrently with such asset sale, another party would acquire the remainder of NewStar and its asset management platform. First Eagle and another
asset manager, which we refer to as “Party A”, had expressed interest in acquiring NewStar’s asset management platform. Senior management informed
the board that, unlike the going-private transaction previously explored, management would not have any equity participation in the acquisition, would
receive the same merger consideration as the other stockholders and had not discussed post-closing employment or compensation arrangements with the
other potential parties to the transaction then being discussed. The board also considered the relationship of one of our directors, Mr. Thornburgh, to
Corsair, which holds with Blackstone a majority interest in First Eagle. Given Corsair’s interest in one of the potential bidders for the asset management
platform, the board determined, and Mr. Thornburgh concurred, that it would be appropriate to exclude Mr. Thornburgh from board deliberations on the
potential transactions being considered. For purposes of the remainder of this section, each reference to the board or board of directors of NewStar (or
any meeting thereof) is intended to refer to that board or meeting without any participation by Mr. Thornburgh who on and after such time recused
himself from such board meetings and deliberations. The board also noted Mr. Thornburgh’s relationships with Credit Suisse, including
Mr. Thornburgh’s position as a member of the boards of directors of Credit Suisse Group AG and certain of its affiliates and service as Chairman of the
Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC. A representative of Simpson Thacher reviewed with the board its fiduciary duties in
connection with the potential transactions being considered. The board discussed the

potential transaction involving GSO, along with other possible strategic alternatives, including continuing with NewStar’s existing strategy to transition
to a capital-light asset manager or a sale of NewStar to a single buyer, and concluded that, in light of GSO’s familiarity with NewStar’s business and
loan portfolio and its prominence in fundraising for a broad variety of asset classes, it was worth exploring a potential transaction of the type described
involving GSO. Accordingly, the board authorized management to engage in further discussions with GSO, First Eagle and Party A regarding a potential
transaction.

Following such meeting, NewStar engaged in further discussions with GSO, First Eagle and Party A regarding the proposed transactions and such
parties continued to engage in due diligence reviews of NewStar and its loan and investment portfolio subject to confidentiality agreements that each
had entered into with NewStar. Toward the end of April, Party A indicated to NewStar that it was no longer interested in acquiring the company’s asset
management platform because of the amount of ongoing capital needs of the business required to support proposed lending activity and comply with
risk retention rules applicable to securitization sponsors.

On May 3, 2017, our board met, with members of senior management and representatives of Locke Lord participating in the meeting. Senior
management provided an update on the status of discussions with GSO and First Eagle. The board discussed Credit Suisse’s potential engagement as
NewStar’s financial advisor for a sale or other business combination transaction involving the company. The board determined that Mr. Thornburgh’s
relationships with Credit Suisse would not adversely affect Credit Suisse’s ability to act as a financial advisor to NewStar, and the board approved
re-engaging Credit Suisse as NewStar’s financial advisor in connection with a sale or other business combination transaction involving the company.
NewStar selected Credit Suisse as its financial advisor because of, among other things, Credit Suisse’s familiarity with NewStar and its business,
including NewStar’s prior sale process in 2013, and Credit Suisse’s qualifications, experience and reputation.

During this period, GSO and First Eagle continued their due diligence review of NewStar’s operations and asset portfolio.

On or about May 4, 2017, a representative of a private equity firm, which we refer to as “Party B”, contacted senior management of NewStar and
indicated that Party B would be interested in evaluating a possible acquisition of NewStar.

On May 16, 2017, our board met, with members of senior management and representatives of Locke Lord, Credit Suisse and Simpson Thacher also
participating. Senior management provided an update on the status of discussions with GSO and First Eagle and also reported to the board on the
indication of interest received from Party B. The board discussed the potential transaction and whether to initiate a broader process for the sale of the
company. A representative of Simpson Thacher reviewed with the board its fiduciary duties in connection with these matters. Credit Suisse reviewed
with the board the results of the 2013 sale process and discussed the current state of the mergers and acquisitions market for companies, such as
NewStar, in the leveraged loan business, noting that it believed, based on the bank regulatory environment and the results of the 2013 sale process, that
potential buyers would likely consist primarily of alternative asset managers, such as GSO and Party B, rather than banks or other regulated financial
institutions. The board concluded that management should continue discussions with GSO and First Eagle and with Party B and that it would not be in
the best interests of the NewStar stockholders to initiate a broader sale process at this time.

On May 25, 2017, an affiliate of Party B, which affiliate was engaged in the business of providing financing to middle market companies, signed a
confidentiality agreement with NewStar. Party B and its affiliate began a due diligence review of NewStar and engaged in discussions with NewStar
regarding a potential transaction.

On June 6, 2017, NewStar received a letter from GSO and First Eagle expressing their initial indication of interest in an asset purchase transaction in
which a GSO-managed fund would purchase NewStar’s loan and investment portfolio and First Eagle would acquire NewStar’s asset management
platform, with NewStar’s stockholders to receive the net proceeds from such sale, following repayment of debt and other liabilities, which net proceeds
were estimated by GSO and First Eagle to result in payment to NewStar’s stockholders of $11.50 to $12.25 per share.

On June 7, 2017, our board met, with members of senior management and representatives of Credit Suisse, Simpson Thacher and Locke Lord
participating in the meeting. The board and senior management, together with NewStar’s financial and legal advisors, discussed the asset sale proposal
from GSO and First Eagle and Party B’s interest in an acquisition of the entire company. The board concluded that an asset sale transaction, with the
public company stockholders being left with a shell company that could liquidate and distribute proceeds to its stockholders over time once all
outstanding liabilities were satisfied, was not a viable structure for a transaction. Instead, the board concluded that GSO and First Eagle should be
requested to develop a proposal that involved a merger or other acquisition of shares from the stockholders. The board instructed management and
Credit Suisse to request this change in proposed transaction structure, as well as improved financial and other terms, from GSO and First Eagle and to
request that Party B provide a proposal as well.

Following the board meeting, in accordance with the board’s directives, NewStar management and Credit Suisse engaged in discussions with GSO and
First Eagle to improve their proposal and with Party B to provide a proposal. On June 12, 2017, Credit Suisse, on behalf of NewStar, sent GSO and First
Eagle a letter requesting that they provide additional information to NewStar, including details regarding the basis for the range of the proposed
purchase price, transaction structure, their valuation of tax refunds that may result from losses generated by the transaction and an allocation of value
between the assets and the asset manager.

On June 19, 2017, in accordance with the board’s directives, Credit Suisse, on behalf of NewStar, sent Party B a bid instruction letter requesting that a
preliminary indication of interest be submitted to NewStar by June 30, 2017.

On June 21, 2017, First Eagle and GSO submitted a revised indication of interest letter providing additional details of their proposal, including that they
were prepared to consider an acquisition of the shares of NewStar and would be open to discussions regarding structures such as a contingent value right
that would allow NewStar’s stockholders to benefit from any post-closing tax refund proceeds resulting from the proposed transaction. The revised
indication of interest continued to estimate that the transaction would result in proceeds to the NewStar stockholders of $11.50 to $12.25 per share.

On June 30, 2017, Party B submitted an indication of interest for an acquisition of all of NewStar’s common stock at a price of $12.00 per share in cash.
On July 5, 2017, Party B submitted a revised indication of interest that retained its initial $12.00 per share offer and also indicated that as the alternative
to acquiring NewStar, Party B would be interested in acquiring all of NewStar’s loans valued at 99.5% of current net carrying value and third party CLO
tranches at market value. Party B indicated that the transaction would be financed with existing funds and would not require financing from unaffiliated
third parties.

On July 11, 2017, GSO and First Eagle submitted an indication of interest for a proposed transaction that involved a GSO-managed fund, with equity
provided from third party investors (who were not identified), acquiring specified loan and investment assets from NewStar, and First Eagle acquiring
NewStar using the net proceeds from such asset sale, following NewStar settling its outstanding debt and other liabilities with such asset sale proceeds,
together with the proceeds from certain other transactions including the sale of certain real estate owned by NewStar and the transfer by NewStar of
loans it had originated into a newly formed fund, as well as additional cash from First Eagle. GSO and First Eagle estimated, based on the pricing
formula attached to their proposal, that this transaction would result in the NewStar stockholders receiving $11.50 per share (assuming, among other
things, that the owned real estate was sold for its carrying value of $15.6 million), plus up to $0.48 per share of book value accretion in the third and
fourth quarters prior to closing plus tax refunds of $0.93 per share to be paid following the closing pursuant to contingent value rights to be issued to the
stockholders at closing.

NewStar and its advisors continued to engage in discussions with GSO and First Eagle and with Party B and assist such parties in their diligence with
respect to NewStar and its loan and investment assets. NewStar, together with its tax advisors, also evaluated the contingent value rights based on tax
refunds that were being proposed by GSO and First Eagle.

On July 26, 2017, following further negotiations, GSO and First Eagle submitted a revised indication of interest letter for a transaction with the same
structure as proposed in their July 11 letter, but increased the preliminary estimated per share purchase price to $11.68 per share, plus up to $0.48 per
share of book value accretion and contingent value rights for an additional $0.93 per share as in the previous letter.

On July 31, 2017, our board met, with members of senior management and representatives of Credit Suisse, Simpson Thacher and Locke Lord
participating in the meeting, to discuss the indications of interest received from GSO and First Eagle and from Party B, including management’s
evaluation of the tax refunds, and related payments under the contingent value rights, that could be obtained in the proposed transaction with GSO and
First Eagle. In connection with this meeting, following execution of Credit Suisse’s engagement letter as of July 27, 2017, Credit Suisse provided
information to the board regarding Credit Suisse’s material relationships with GSO, First Eagle, Party B and certain other parties. Credit Suisse also
provided the board with a list of illustrative potential acquirors of NewStar and/or its assets in addition to summary overviews of the indications of
interest received from GSO, First Eagle and Party B. At this meeting, the board expressed concerns about the lack of detail in the GSO and First Eagle
proposal regarding the equity and debt financing for the transaction, as well as the fact that the stockholders were not assured a certain purchase price in
such a transaction. The board also considered Party B’s proposal, noting the simpler transaction structure but lower expected aggregate value compared
to the proposal from GSO and First Eagle. The board instructed NewStar’s management and advisors to continue discussions and negotiations with GSO
and First Eagle and with Party B and seek clarification and improvement of their respective indications of interest. In addition, management reported
that GSO had requested the opportunity to make an in-person presentation to the board regarding their plans to raise debt and equity financing for the
proposed transaction, and related matters. The board concluded that it would be useful to receive such a presentation from GSO.

On August 4, 2017, our board met, with members of senior management and representatives of Credit Suisse, Simpson Thacher and GSO participating
in the meeting. The representatives of GSO noted that, as a result of their familiarity with NewStar’s assets and loan origination capabilities due to the
ongoing strategic cooperation between NewStar and GSO since the 2014 investment transaction, GSO was highly confident in its ability to secure equity
commitments from leading institutional investors and other credit market participants to invest in a fund that would acquire NewStar’s loan and
investment portfolio. The representatives of GSO described GSO’s fundraising process and noted that, if NewStar permitted GSO to solicit third party
interest in such a transaction, in approximately two weeks GSO would be able to present a list of potential investors to the company. The GSO
representatives also provided our board with an overview of GSO’s debt financing plans and the steps GSO had taken so far to secure committed debt
financing. After the representatives of GSO left the meeting, the board discussed and concluded that GSO should be allowed to solicit interest from third
party investors for equity commitments to invest in the proposed transaction and develop its debt financing plan. Our board also instructed management,
with the assistance of NewStar’s legal and financial advisors, to request final bids by a specified date later in the month.

During this period the independent directors held separate regularly scheduled meetings with NewStar’s financial and legal advisors (including on
July 31, August 4, August 9 and August 16) to be briefed on and discuss the ongoing negotiations and communications with GSO, First Eagle and Party
B.

On August 10, 2017, a draft merger agreement prepared by Simpson Thacher was sent to Party B and on August 14, 2017, a detailed term sheet
prepared by Simpson Thacher for the proposed GSO and First Eagle transaction was sent to GSO and First Eagle (which was prepared for discussion
purposes in lieu of draft definitive agreements due to the greater complexity of the GSO and First Eagle proposal and need for additional detail to
develop various provisions). On August 16, 2017, in accordance with the board’s directives, bid instruction letters were sent by Credit Suisse, on behalf
of NewStar, to GSO and First Eagle and to Party B, requesting that each bidder submit a final written offer on August 23 together with a markup of the
merger agreement (for Party B) or the detailed term sheet (for GSO / First Eagle).

On August 22, 2017, Party B submitted a markup of the merger agreement, which included a financing condition; however Party B did not submit a
proposal letter or any other indication of interest. Over the next

several days representatives of Simpson Thacher negotiated the merger agreement markup with counsel for Party B.

On August 23, 2017, GSO and First Eagle submitted a proposal with a variable purchase price formula (which would result in a purchase price then
estimated to be $11.85 per share plus the contingent value right then estimated at $1.00 per share) along with a markup of the detailed term sheet for the
transaction. The proposal provided that the purchase price would be calculated as of a “measurement date” prior to mailing the proxy statement to
NewStar stockholders, with the actual purchase price to be paid to stockholders to be based on a variety of factors, including adjustments as a result of
loans that became non-performing or impaired after signing, the unpaid principal balance of the performing loans on the measurement date, the net book
value of certain investment securities to be retained by NewStar, projected earnings of NewStar through the closing and debt and liabilities of the
company as of the measurement date. In addition, the proposal provided that stockholders would only be paid under the contingent value rights once the
tax refunds were approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation and were no longer subject to audit or challenge by the IRS. The letter provided names
of the proposed investors that had signed indications of interest to subscribe for equity in the newly-formed fund that would purchase the NewStar assets
and also attached letters from Wells Fargo and CDPQ stating that they were highly confident of their ability to provide debt financing for a transaction.

Following receipt of the GSO and First Eagle proposal, NewStar and its financial and legal advisors discussed the proposal, including the formula
purchase price, contingent value rights, and other issues raised by the proposal, including that NewStar was not permitted to enforce the equity
commitment letters to be provided by the third party investors, the fact that the reverse termination fee under the asset purchase agreement was 4% of
transaction equity value and was not guaranteed by a credit-worthy entity, the lack of a go-shop period to solicit potential proposals after entering into
the definitive agreements and the fact that GSO and First Eagle would not need to close the transaction if 5% or more of the NewStar stockholders made
appraisal demands. On August 25, 2017, management instructed Credit Suisse to convey NewStar’s concerns regarding these issues to Wells Fargo, the
financial advisor to GSO and First Eagle. Later on August 25, 2017, as instructed, representatives of Credit Suisse spoke with representatives of Wells
Fargo regarding NewStar’s concerns and, following that call, Wells Fargo indicated to Credit Suisse that GSO and First Eagle would be submitting a
revised proposal to attempt to address these issues.

On August 25, 2017, Party B sent a letter to NewStar stating that it remained interested in the opportunity and expected to be able to finish business due
diligence in a few weeks but indicated it was not in a position to submit a proposal at that time.

On August 28, 2017, GSO and First Eagle submitted a revised proposal, with a fixed price bid of $11.44 per share (with a potential $0.05 increase if
certain real estate owned by NewStar is sold for at least $12 million) and the contingent value rights receiving payment of 25% of any tax refund upon
receipt, with the remainder held back pending JCT approval and completion of the IRS audit. While the letter did not address the other issues with the
proposal that had been discussed with Wells Fargo, the letter indicated that GSO and First Eagle believed there could be a commercially reasonable
resolution to such matters. The letter also noted that the proposal was conditioned on NewStar agreeing to negotiate exclusively with GSO and First
Eagle.

On August 29, 2017, our board met, with members of senior management and representatives of Credit Suisse, Simpson Thacher and Richards,
Layton & Finger, our Delaware counsel, participating in the meeting. Representatives of Simpson Thacher and Richards Layton reviewed with the board
its fiduciary duties. The board reviewed the prior attempts to sell NewStar in the 2013 sale process and the multiple parties that had been contacted and
had had discussions with NewStar since then regarding strategic alternatives. The board then discussed the proposal received from GSO and First Eagle,
including the change to a fixed purchase price from a purchase price formula and the other issues with the GSO and First Eagle proposal. The board also
discussed the letter from Party B indicating an inability to submit a bid at that time. The board instructed management to negotiate with GSO and First
Eagle to resolve the remaining issues in order to improve the terms of their proposal.

Over the course of the next several days, in accordance with the board’s directives, NewStar and its advisors had discussions with GSO, First Eagle and
their advisors regarding the terms of the GSO and First Eagle proposal. GSO and First Eagle agreed to modify their proposal to provide, among other
things, that the contingent value rights would pay to stockholders 30% of any tax refund promptly upon receipt, the transaction agreements would
contain a go shop that would have a 2% termination fee (with a 3% fee in other circumstances), there would not be an appraisal demand closing
condition, NewStar would be provided adequate enforcement rights with respect to the equity commitment letter and the reverse termination fee would
be increased to 5% of transaction equity value.

On August 31, 2017, our board met, with members of senior management and representatives of Credit Suisse and Simpson Thacher participating in the
meeting. The board discussed the revised proposal from GSO and First Eagle and authorized management to continue to negotiate a transaction with
GSO and First Eagle on such terms. The board also considered that GSO and First Eagle had conditioned such proposal on NewStar agreeing to
negotiate exclusively with them. The board considered the fact that Party B had not submitted a proposal and determined that the transaction with GSO
and First Eagle was in an advanced stage with a high likelihood of completion, and accordingly approved NewStar entering into an agreement to provide
for a limited period of exclusivity to finalize a transaction.

On September 4, 2017, NewStar entered into an exclusivity agreement with GSO and First Eagle, which granted them exclusivity until September 27,
2017.

On September 5, 2017, in accordance with NewStar’s directives, a representative of Credit Suisse informed Party B that NewStar had determined to
proceed with negotiations with a different party. Party B did not indicate an interest in remaining in the process during that call and did not make any
further inbound calls or inquiries to NewStar or its advisors.

On September 10, 2017, Simpson Thacher sent a draft merger agreement to Goodwin Procter, legal counsel to First Eagle and Sidley Austin, legal
counsel to GSO, and on September 13, 2017, Simpson Thacher sent a draft asset purchase agreement to Sidley Austin and Goodwin Procter.

On September 20, 2017, Goodwin Procter sent a revised merger agreement to Simpson Thacher and in the evening of September 22, 2017, Sidley
Austin sent a revised asset purchase agreement to Simpson Thacher. Over the course of the next week the parties and their advisors discussed issues
presented by these revised drafts, including ensuring that the debt financing would be sufficient to provide the necessary funding for the asset purchase,
since Wells Fargo would be providing a fixed advance rate only for existing loans in the portfolio (and not new loans or loans in the pipeline) and Wells
Fargo would only advance funds against new loans if it approved the new loans in advance, representations and warranties and interim operating
covenants in both the asset purchase agreement and the merger agreement and the closing conditions relating thereto and provisions with respect to
guaranteeing payment of the reverse termination fee.

On September 22, 2017, our board met, with members of senior management and representatives of Credit Suisse and Simpson Thacher participating in
the meeting. The board discussed the status of negotiations and also approved NewStar engaging Houlihan Lokey as an additional financial advisor to,
among other things, if appropriate and requested by NewStar, provide an opinion to our board with respect to whether the consideration to be received
by the holders of NewStar common stock in the proposed transaction or certain other transactions was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders and assist NewStar in soliciting and evaluating indications of interest and proposals regarding alternative transactions after the signing of a
definitive agreement with respect to the proposed transaction. Houlihan Lokey subsequently provided our board with information with respect to its
relationships with First Eagle, GSO and certain other parties. Our board concluded that these relationships did not adversely affect Houlihan Lokey’s
ability to provide objective advice as our financial advisor. Houlihan Lokey was selected as a financial advisor based on Houlihan Lokey’s experience
and reputation and its familiarity with NewStar, having acted as financial advisor to NewStar in connection with the

sale of its equipment finance business in 2016. Houlihan Lokey is regularly engaged to provide financial advisory services in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, financings, and financial restructurings.

On September 26, 2017, our board met, with members of senior management and representatives of Credit Suisse and Simpson Thacher participating in
the meeting. The board discussed the status of negotiations.

On September 28, 2017, Simpson Thacher sent Goodwin Procter and Sidley Austin a revised draft of the merger agreement. On September 30, 2017
Goodwin Procter sent Simpson Thacher a revised draft of the merger agreement reflecting further comments, including with respect to representations
and warranties, interim operating covenants and conditions to closing.

From October 1, 2017 through October 7, 2017, the parties exchanged drafts of the asset purchase agreement, merger agreement and ancillary
documents. While the parties were negotiating the transaction documents, GSO, First Eagle and their advisors continued to conduct a due diligence
review of NewStar and its loan and investment assets. During this time, representatives of GSO and First Eagle also discussed with representatives of
NewStar the fact that GSO and First Eagle were continuing to negotiate with each other the allocation of assets between the two purchasers. The
revisions to the asset purchase agreement, including changes to the assets to be acquired by the GSO-sponsored fund and the purchase price payable
(including the addition of pre-closing estimates and post-closing true-ups of the purchase price), reflected these ongoing discussions between GSO and
First Eagle. In addition, the parties continued to negotiate and discuss the interim operating covenants restricting NewStar’s business in between signing
and closing. Such discussions were complicated by a number of factors, including the need to obtain advance approval by Wells Fargo under the debt
commitment letter for new loans and other funding commitments by NewStar, the fact that many of the loans and investments assets in the pool of assets
to be purchased by GSO would prepay between signing and closing, with GSO wanting to acquire any assets acquired with the proceeds from such
prepayments and the fact that First Eagle required limitations on NewStar’s ability to take on additional debt to fund new loans being acquired by
GSO.    In addition, the parties continued to discuss the detailed representations regarding the loan and investment assets and related closing conditions.

Our board held meetings on October 3, October 7 and October 9 to discuss the status of negotiations and related transactional matters with members of
senior management and NewStar’s financial and legal advisors. In advance of the October 7th meeting, Credit Suisse provided the board with updated
information regarding its material relationships with GSO, First Eagle and certain other parties and, at the October 7th meeting, Credit Suisse and
Houlihan Lokey discussed their respective preliminary financial perspectives with respect to NewStar and the proposed merger consideration.

On October 10, 2017, representatives of NewStar, GSO, First Eagle and their respective advisors met at the offices of Simpson Thacher in New York to
address outstanding issues with respect to the allocation of assets and post-closing adjustments between GSO and First Eagle, the purchase price to be
paid by GSO for such assets, the interim operating covenants for the operation of NewStar’s business between signing and closing and other issues
raised by the transaction agreements. Significant progress was made towards resolving such issues and on October 10, 2017, Simpson Thacher sent
Sidley Austin and Goodwin Procter a revised draft of the asset purchase agreement and on October 11, 2017, Simpson Thacher sent a revised draft of
the merger agreement. Over the course of the next several days the parties continued to exchange drafts of and negotiate the transaction agreements.

On October 15, 2017, our board met, with members of senior management and representatives of Credit Suisse, Houlihan Lokey and Simpson Thacher
participating in the meeting. At the meeting, representatives of Simpson Thacher reviewed with the board the key provisions of the near-final transaction
agreements. Our board discussed the strategic, business and legal considerations related to the proposed transaction and the benefits and risks of the
transactions compared to the alternatives available to NewStar. Our board also discussed the terms of the anticipated go-shop process. Based on the
foregoing, our board indicated it was supportive of the terms of the transaction, subject to finalization of the remaining supporting schedules and related
matters.

On October 16, 2017, after trading closed on the NASDAQ, our board met to consider the proposed transaction. Members of NewStar’s management
and representatives of Credit Suisse, Houlihan Lokey and Simpson Thacher also participated in the meeting. Members of NewStar’s management
updated the board on the projections of the value of the contingent value rights. Representatives of Simpson Thacher reviewed the proposed transaction
agreements and the other transaction documents with the board and updated the board on the negotiation of the transaction agreements. At the request of
our board, Credit Suisse and Houlihan Lokey then separately reviewed with the board their respective financial analyses and each rendered an oral
opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated October 16, 2017, to the board to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to
various assumptions made, procedures followed and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken and other matters considered in connection
with the preparation of such opinions, the merger consideration to be received by holders (other than excluded holders, as defined in such opinion, and
their respective affiliates) of NewStar common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Credit
Suisse, Houlihan Lokey and Simpson Thacher also discussed with the board the proposed go-shop process. Following discussions among the board,
NewStar’s senior management and advisors regarding the proposed transactions, the members of the board present unanimously approved the merger
agreement, the asset purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated by such agreements, declared advisable the merger agreement, the asset
purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated by such agreements, recommended that NewStar stockholders vote for the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement and approved the amendment to the bylaws making the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware the exclusive jurisdiction in which litigation may be brought if such litigation is a derivative action, an
action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty, an action arising under the DGCL, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of NewStar or the
bylaws of NewStar, or an action governed by the internal affairs doctrine. For further information concerning the factors considered by the board in
reaching its decision to approve the transaction agreements and transactions, its decision to declare the transaction agreements and the transactions
advisable and its decision to recommend that NewStar stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the asset sale, see “—
Recommendation of the NewStar Board and Its Reasons for the Transactions; Fairness of the Transactions” beginning on page 41 of this proxy
statement.

On the evening of October 16, 2017, after trading closed on the NASDAQ, the parties executed the merger agreement, the asset purchase agreement and
related transaction agreements. Early in the morning on October 17, 2017, before trading opened on the NASDAQ, NewStar and First Eagle issued a
joint press release announcing the transactions.

Beginning on October 17, 2017, NewStar commenced the go-shop process with outreaches to potential bidders selected by NewStar with assistance
from its financial advisors Credit Suisse and Houlihan Lokey. During the go-shop process, NewStar, with the assistance of Credit Suisse and Houlihan
Lokey, contacted 53 parties (including Party B) to solicit alternative transaction proposals and seven other parties made unsolicited inquiries shortly
after the proposed transactions with First Eagle and the Asset Buyer, and the commencement of the go-shop process, were publicly announced. NewStar
entered into confidentiality agreements with 22 of those parties (including Party B), which were provided access to additional information, including
access to a virtual data room.

Our board met on a weekly basis during the go-shop period, with members of senior management and representatives of Credit Suisse, Houlihan Lokey
and Simpson Thacher participating in the meetings, to discuss the status of the go-shop process.

On November 2, 2017, the House Ways and Means Committee released the Tax Bill, which, due to a provision that would eliminate the ability to
carryback NOLs arising in tax years beginning after 2017, would result in holders of the contingent value rights not being entitled to any payments
thereunder if the closing of the asset sale were to occur in 2018 and the Tax Bill is enacted in its current form (as described in further detail in “—Recent
Developments Potentially Affecting the Contingent Value Rights”). Following release of the Tax Bill, over the course of the next several days, NewStar
discussed its potential impact on the transaction with its accounting, financial and legal advisors and Mr. Conway provided the other directors
(excluding Mr. Thornburgh) an update regarding these matters.

On November 3, 2017, at the request of Party B, NewStar and Party B had a call to address questions from Party B regarding its due diligence review of
NewStar.

On November 9, 2017, NewStar filed the preliminary proxy statement that included disclosure regarding the potential impact of the Tax Bill on the
contingent value rights. Later that day, the Senate Committee on Finance released its version of the Tax Bill, which has a comparable provision that
would eliminate the ability to carryback net operating losses arising in tax years beginning after 2017, subject to limited exceptions not relevant to the
contingent value rights (as described in further detail in “Recent Developments Potentially Affecting the Contingent Value Rights”).

On November 15, 2017, our board met, with members of senior management and representatives of Credit Suisse, Houlihan Lokey and Simpson
Thacher participating in the meeting. Credit Suisse and Houlihan Lokey provided our board with an update on the go-shop process, which had not
resulted in any alternative acquisition proposals from any of the parties solicited (including from Party B) or that had made unsolicited inquiries, and
noted that certain of the parties had expressed varying reasons for declining to pursue a potential transaction with NewStar that included, among other
things, the size of NewStar’s investment portfolio, misalignment with their current strategy, the implied valuation for the investment portfolio required
to exceed the merger consideration to be paid by First Eagle and the inability to pay a premium to the merger consideration. The board also discussed
possible steps to mitigate any potential adverse impact from the Tax Bill, including trying to accelerate the proxy statement mailing to ensure the special
stockholders’ meeting is held before year-end.

At 12:01 a.m. (New York time) on November 16, 2017, the go-shop period ended. NewStar did not receive any acquisition proposals during the go-shop
period.

On November 16, 2017, the Tax Bill proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee passed in the U.S. House of Representatives.

On November 17, 2017, Mr. Conway informed representatives of First Eagle and GSO of the results of the go-shop process, as required by the merger
agreement and asset purchase agreement, and indicated that NewStar, together with its accounting advisors, was evaluating potential strategies to
mitigate the potential impact of the Tax Bill.

On November 20, 2017, our board met, with members of senior management and representatives of Credit Suisse, Houlihan Lokey and Simpson
Thacher participating in the meeting, to discuss the potential impact of the Tax Bill on NewStar in the event the transactions with First Eagle and the
Asset Buyer do not close by year-end, including the potential effects of the Tax Bill, if enacted, on NewStar’s operations.

Recommendation of the NewStar Board and Its Reasons for the Transactions; Fairness of the Transactions

At a meeting of the board held on October 16, 2017, the board approved the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement by a unanimous
vote of the directors present (with Mr. Thornburgh having been recused from the meeting as described above), and the board recommends that
stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal and “FOR” the asset sale proposal.

Our board has, by the unanimous vote of all directors voting:
 

 
•  determined that the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated by such agreements are advisable

and in the best interests of NewStar and its stockholders;
 

 
•  determined that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and asset purchase agreement are fair to NewStar’s unaffiliated

securityholders;

Table of Contents

 
•  adopted resolutions approving the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated by such

agreements and declared the advisability of the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated by
such agreements; and

 

 

•  resolved to recommend that the stockholders of NewStar adopt the merger agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
the merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the asset purchase agreement and directed that such matters be submitted to NewStar’s stockholders at the special meeting for
their approval.

In reaching its decision, the board evaluated the merger and the asset sale in consultation with NewStar’s senior management and its financial, tax
and legal advisors, and, at its October 16, 2017 meeting and at other meetings at which it considered the proposed transactions, the board considered a
number of factors.

The reasons considered by the board in favor of the merger proposal and the asset sale proposal included the following (not necessarily in order of
relative importance):
 

 
•  the merger consideration to be received by the NewStar stockholders of (i) $11.44 per share in upfront cash and (ii) one contingent value

right, which was estimated to be worth an additional $0.88 to $1.00 per share;
 

 
•  the total merger consideration was estimated at $12.32 to $12.44 per share, which represented a premium of 10.4% to 11.5% over NewStar’s

three-month volume weighted average price of $11.16 per share as of October 16, 2017, the last trading day before the transaction
announcement;

 

 
•  the current and historical market prices for NewStar’s common stock, including those set forth in the table under “Market Price of Common

Stock and Dividends” beginning on page 143 of this proxy statement;
 

 
•  the fact that a significant portion of the merger consideration would be paid in cash at the closing, which provides certainty and immediate

liquidity and value to NewStar’s stockholders, enabling NewStar’s stockholders to realize value that has been created at NewStar while
eliminating long-term business and execution risk;

 

 
•  the potential risks and uncertainties facing NewStar’s stockholders associated with possible strategic alternatives to the merger and asset sale

(including remaining independent and continuing with its existing or a modified business plan), and the timing and likelihood of
accomplishing such alternatives;

 

 

•  NewStar’s extended efforts over the past four years to find a buyer for the company, which did not produce any buyer at a price equal to that
provided by the GSO / First Eagle transaction offers, as well as NewStar’s discussions with a variety of other parties regarding possible
alternative transactions and its consideration of numerous strategic alternatives, including going private or reorganizing as a publicly traded
partnership, none of which resulted in an actionable alternative (all as further described in “—Background of the Transactions” beginning on
page 31 of this proxy statement);

 

 

•  the fact that until the no-shop period start date, NewStar would have the right to solicit proposals or offers that constitute, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to such
proposals or offers (as further described in “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement—Merger Agreement—Go-Shop; No
Solicitation” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement);

 

 
•  the fact that, under certain circumstances, NewStar would have the right to engage in negotiations or discussions following the no-shop

period start date with any person that makes an acquisition proposal to NewStar (as further described in “The Merger Agreement and the
Asset Purchase Agreement—Merger Agreement—Go-Shop; No Solicitation” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement);

 

 
•  the right of NewStar to terminate the merger agreement and asset purchase agreement to accept a superior proposal subject to the payment of

a termination fee of either $10 million or $15 million in

certain circumstances (as further described in “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement—Merger Agreement—Go-Shop;
No Solicitation” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement);

 

 
•  the right of the board under certain circumstances to change its recommendation that NewStar’s stockholders vote to approve the merger

proposal and the asset sale proposal (as further described in “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement—Merger
Agreement—Change of Recommendation” beginning on page 105 of this proxy statement);

 

 

•  the financial presentation and opinion of Credit Suisse, dated October 16, 2017, to the board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view
and as of the date of such opinion, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of NewStar common stock (other than excluded
holders and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement, which opinion was based on and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken;

 

 

•  the financial analysis reviewed by Houlihan Lokey with the board as well as the oral opinion of Houlihan Lokey rendered to the board on
October 16, 2017 (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Houlihan Lokey’s written opinion addressed to the board
dated October 16, 2017), as to, as of such date, the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of NewStar common stock other
than the excluded holders (as defined in such opinion) of the merger consideration to be received by such holders (other than the excluded
holders) pursuant to the merger agreement in connection with the transaction (as defined in such opinion);

 

 •  the likelihood that the merger and asset sale would be completed;
 

 •  the business reputation and capabilities of GSO and First Eagle;
 

 
•  the fact that stockholders who do not vote to adopt the merger agreement and who comply with the requirements of the DGCL will have the

right to demand appraisal of the fair value of their shares under the DGCL;
 

 
•  the board discussed other potential transactions leading up to the transactions with First Eagle and GSO, as described in “Special Factors–

Background of the Transactions”, and directed management to pursue exploratory discussions with various parties, but none of those
discussions led to a formal indication of interest or a proposal for the board to consider;

 

 
•  in respect of the proposal from Party B, as described in further detail in the paragraphs beneath these bullets, the board’s view was that the

timing and likelihood of receiving a definitive offer was uncertain at best, given among other things:
 

 
○  Party B’s decision to not submit any offer subsequent to its preliminary, non-binding indication of interest of $12.00 per share

provided on July 5, 2017, which indication of interest was and continued to be subject to completion of Party B’s due diligence
review;

 

 
○  the fact that, after NewStar informed Party B on September 5, 2017 that it was negotiating a transaction with another party, Party B

did not initiate any further inquiries or discussions with NewStar while NewStar, First Eagle and the Asset Buyer negotiated the
terms of the merger agreement and asset purchase agreement for over a month prior to signing on October 16, 2017; and

 

 

○  the fact that the merger agreement and asset purchase agreement have a go-shop provision that allowed NewStar to contact Party B
after signing the merger agreement and asset purchase agreement and the board’s determination that the termination fees under such
agreements would not be a meaningful deterrent to Party B (or any other party) proposing an alternative acquisition proposal (and, as
described in “Special Factors–Background of the Transactions”, NewStar in fact contacted Party B during the go-shop period and
Party B signed a confidentiality agreement and conducted a limited due diligence review of NewStar, but neither Party B nor any
other party submitted an acquisition proposal during the go-shop period or afterwards);

Table of Contents

 
•  the fact that the transactions with First Eagle and Asset Buyer would provide more value to NewStar’s stockholders than the transaction

proposed by Party B’s indication of interest regardless of whether the transactions close in 2017 or 2018;
 

 
•  the fact that NewStar had not received a firm offer from any other person for the acquisition of NewStar, despite its efforts over the years to

sell the company as further described in the “Background”, including:
 

 
○  a 2013 sale process in which over 60 parties were contacted and which was reported in the press; however, NewStar only received

two preliminary indications of interest, both of which were later withdrawn;
 

 
○  the lack of any proposals received in connection with the exploration of a transaction with GSO during 2016 and early 2017, despite

over 20 parties being contacted to solicit their interest in investing in an acquisition of, or acquiring, NewStar; and
 

 
○  the fact that Party A, after undertaking an extensive due diligence review of NewStar, determined that it was not interested in

pursuing a transaction involving NewStar; and
 

 
•  the fact that the merger and asset sale are each subject to approval by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares

of NewStar common stock.

The board also considered the following potentially negative factors associated with the merger and asset sale (not necessarily in order of relative
importance):

 

 
•  the fact that NewStar will no longer exist as an independent public company and NewStar stockholders will forgo any future

increase in NewStar’s value that might result from our earnings or possible growth as an independent company;
 

 
•  the fact that a portion of the merger consideration to be paid to NewStar’s stockholders is based solely on the receipt of tax refunds

following the closing, a large portion of which is subject to approval by government agencies, and both the timing and amount of
such payments could be uncertain and subject to factors outside NewStar’s control;

 

 
•  the fact that the Asset Buyer is a newly formed entity with no assets other than the debt commitment letters and equity commitment

letters and therefore if the Asset Buyer fails to obtain sufficient financing, the transactions will not be completed;
 

 
•  the fact that the debt commitment letters do not commit the lenders to provide a minimum level of debt financing; instead, the

amount of debt available to the Asset Buyer will depend on the valuation of the loans and investments being acquired by the Asset
Buyer ascribed to such assets by Wells Fargo in accordance with the terms of the debt commitment letters;

 

 

•  the fact that while GSO and Blackstone-affiliated funds and entities are committing $175 million, the remainder of the equity
financing is to be provided by 8 additional third party investors and the risk, given the number of investors and the fact that they are
located in multiple foreign jurisdictions, that if the investors do not fund when required, NewStar would be unable to enforce (or
enforce in a timely manner) a sufficient amount of equity commitments to be able to close the transaction;

 

 
•  the fact that while NewStar would generally be entitled to a $25 million reverse termination fee if the Asset Buyer fails to close

when required (including as a result of the failure of the Asset Buyer to obtain sufficient financing), Asset Buyer did not have those
funds at signing and will only have those funds if its investors provide such funds;

 

 
•  the fact that even if paid, the reverse termination fee may not fully compensate NewStar for the costs of non-consummation in the

circumstances in which it is payable;
 

 

•  the fact that the asset purchase agreement is subject to a closing condition allowing only $5 million of inaccuracies in the detailed
loan and investment schedules and the fact that there can be no assurance that all other conditions to the parties’ obligations to
consummate the merger and asset sale will be satisfied, and, as a result, the possibility that the merger and asset sale might not be
completed;

Table of Contents

 
•  the fact that the transaction agreements contain significant restrictions on NewStar’s ability to conduct its business prior to the

closing, including limitations on originating, acquiring or selling loans, taking actions with respect to existing loans and incurring
additional indebtedness;

 

 
•  the possibility that termination fees payable to First Eagle and the Asset Buyer might have the effect of discouraging alternative

acquisition proposals or reducing the purchase price in such proposals;
 

 
•  the fact that any gains arising from the receipt of the merger consideration would generally be taxable to NewStar’s stockholders that

are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and
 

 •  the potential of litigation in connection with the merger.

In the judgment of the board, however, these potential risks were favorably offset by the potential benefits of the merger and asset sale, including those
described above.

Since 2013 NewStar has sought on a number of occasions to sell the company or engage in strategic alternatives. As described under “Special Factors–
Background of the Transactions”, these efforts have been in response to fundamental changes in the lending and funding markets following the financial
crisis that adversely affected NewStar’s business model and its ability to generate adequate returns on capital for its stockholders as an independent
commercial finance company. After the unsuccessful sale process in 2013 NewStar pursued other alternatives to enhance stockholder value, including
the issuance of subordinated notes and warrants to the Franklin Square funds, but despite these efforts NewStar’s return on equity and total stockholder
return continued to lag the market and the board and management determined it was in the best interests of NewStar’s stockholders to resume seeking a
sale of the company as the best way to maximize stockholder value.

The transaction with GSO and First Eagle was the result of these efforts, which had not previously resulted in any other party making a firm offer for the
acquisition of NewStar. After Party B submitted preliminary, non-binding indications of interest on June 30, 2017 and July 5, 2017 (each of which stated
that as a result of Party B’s substantial industry experience it expected to be able to complete its due diligence review of NewStar and negotiate
definitive documents in three to four weeks), NewStar spent considerable efforts engaging in discussions with Party B and assisting Party B with its due
diligence review of the company. Furthermore, a letter was sent to each of Party B and GSO and First Eagle requesting that a proposal be submitted by
August 23rd. While GSO and First Eagle submitted a proposal at that time, Party B did not, despite ongoing efforts by NewStar with the assistance of its
advisors to encourage Party B to submit a proposal.

Instead, several days after the bid deadline, Party B sent a letter indicating that it was not in a position to submit a proposal at that time, despite the fact
that it had submitted its initial indication of interest almost two months before, on June 30th. GSO and First Eagle submitted a revised proposal on
August 28, which proposal was conditioned on NewStar negotiating exclusively with GSO and First Eagle. The board approved granting GSO and First
Eagle exclusivity only following further negotiation with such parties and obtaining their agreement on key deal terms as described under “Special
Factors–Background of the Transactions”, including the fact that there would be a go-shop process in the definitive agreement which would permit
NewStar to contact Party B. In addition, the board considered the fact that Party B still had not made a proposal, the fact that the proposal from GSO and
First Eagle was conditioned on receiving exclusivity and the judgment of the board and management that the GSO and First Eagle proposal was likely to
lead to the signing of definitive transaction agreements on the terms proposed. Accordingly, the board directed NewStar to enter into an agreement
providing for a limited period of exclusivity.

After Party B was informed on September 5, 2017 that NewStar was negotiating a transaction with another party, Party B did not initiate any further
inquiries or discussions with NewStar while NewStar, First Eagle and the Asset Buyer negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and asset purchase
agreement for over a month prior to signing the merger agreement and asset purchase agreement on October 16, 2017. Furthermore, despite Party B
indicating that it would be in a position to complete its due diligence review and submit a proposal in a few weeks, Party B never submitted a proposal
subsequent to its August 25 letter. In addition, Party B did not submit a proposal after being contacted in the go-shop period, signing a new
confidentiality agreement, being provided access to the virtual data room and having access to NewStar’s management to address questions from Party
B regarding its due diligence review.

Neither the merger proposal nor the asset sale proposal require the approval of at least a majority of unaffiliated stockholders, nor did the independent
directors on the board retain an unaffiliated representative to act on behalf of NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders for purposes of negotiating the terms
of the merger agreement and asset purchase agreement or preparing a report concerning the fairness of such agreements and the transactions
contemplated thereby. Nevertheless, the board believes that sufficient procedural safeguards were and are present to ensure the fairness of the merger
and asset sale and to permit the board to represent effectively the interests of NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders based upon the following factors:
 

 

•  the fact that the board (excluding Mr. Thornburgh, who was recused from all board meetings and deliberations regarding the transactions
and consideration of other strategic alternatives, including during the go-shop process, and apart from Mr. Conway, our Chief Executive
Officer) consists of five independent and disinterested directors of NewStar who are not affiliated with any of Corsair, First Eagle, GSO or
Blackstone, are not employees of NewStar or any of its affiliates and have no financial interest in the merger different from, or in addition to
the interests of NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders other than their interests described under “—Interests of NewStar’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Transactions” beginning on page 82;

 

 
•  the fact that almost 85% of NewStar’s stock is owned by investors unaffiliated with either Corsair or management of NewStar, including an

investor with an ownership interest as large as Corsair’s and four other investors each having, individually, a more than 5% ownership
interest in NewStar;

 

 

•  the fact that, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, and at the direction of the board (excluding Mr. Thornburgh), NewStar
conducted vigorous negotiations with First Eagle and GSO, which, among other matters, resulted in (i) a go-shop process being permitted
under the merger agreement and asset purchase agreement, (ii) a buyer termination fee of 5% of the transaction equity value, which fee is
held in a deposit account subject to a control agreement with NewStar, (iii) the NewStar stockholders being entitled to promptly receive 30%
of any applicable tax refund under the contingent value right promptly upon NewStar’s receipt of such refund, even if still subject to audit
by the IRS, and (iv) the lack of a closing condition relating to the number of stockholders making appraisal demands;

 

 

•  the fact that NewStar has solicited interest for a transaction providing for the acquisition of NewStar from multiple parties since 2013 and
had not received a firm offer from any person other than the Asset Buyer and First Eagle, and that the merger agreement and asset purchase
agreement expressly permitted NewStar to conduct an unrestricted go-shop process after signing (which also did not result in the receipt of
any acquisition proposals); and

 

 
•  the fact that our board was aware that it had no obligation to enter into or recommend any transaction and that the board had the authority to

“say no” to any proposals made by First Eagle, GSO or other potential acquirors.

The foregoing discussion is not intended to be exhaustive, but NewStar believes it addresses the material information and factors considered by the
board in its consideration of the merger and asset sale, including factors that may support the merger, as well as factors that may weigh against it. In
view of the variety of factors and the amount of information considered, the board did not find it practicable to quantify or otherwise assign relative
weights to and did not make specific assessments of the factors considered in reaching its determination, and individual members of the board may have
given different weights to different factors. The board did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered.

The above factors are not presented in any order of priority. This explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above contained forward-looking
statements and should be read in conjunction with the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-
Looking Statements”.

In the course of the board reaching its decisions described above, the board did not consider the liquidation value of NewStar because it considered
NewStar (and its asset manager platform) to be a viable, going concern, and liquidation sales generally result in proceeds substantially less than sales of
going concerns and, as described above in “—Background of the Transactions” beginning on page 31 of this proxy statement, the board had

determined that selling assets and distributing proceeds to its stockholders over time after all outstanding liabilities were satisfied was not a viable
transaction alternative.

Purpose and Reasons of NewStar for the Transactions

As discussed above, our board and management determined previously that a sale of the company was likely the best way to maximize stockholder
value, and after exploring alternatives over an extended period determined that the transactions with GSO and First Eagle are the strategic alternative
that provides the highest value reasonably available at this time. This determination was based on the analyses, determinations and conclusions of the
board described in detail above under “—Recommendation of the NewStar Board and Its Reasons for the Transactions; Fairness of the Transactions”
beginning on page 41 of this proxy statement.

Primary Benefits and Detriments of the Transactions

Benefits and Detriments to NewStar’s Unaffiliated Stockholders

The primary benefits of the merger and asset sale to NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders will be their right to receive a cash payment of $11.44 and one
contingent value right for each share of NewStar common stock. Additionally, after the merger, such stockholders will not be subject to the risk
associated with ownership of NewStar common stock, including any possible decrease in NewStar’s future earnings, growth or value.

The primary detriments of the merger to our stockholders are the lack of interest of such stockholders in any potential future earnings, growth or value
that may be realized by NewStar after the merger. Additionally, the receipt of cash and a contingent value rights in exchange for shares of NewStar
common stock pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders who are U.S.
holders. See “—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 85 of this proxy statement.

Benefits and Detriments to NewStar, First Eagle and Corsair

Following the merger, First Eagle will indirectly own all of the outstanding NewStar shares. Accordingly, the primary benefits of the merger and asset
sale to NewStar, First Eagle and Corsair are the following:
 

 

•  If NewStar and First Eagle successfully execute the business strategy for NewStar to become an investment manager of third-party credit
assets for institutional and retail investors, the value of First Eagle’s investment in NewStar (and indirectly, Corsair’s investment in First
Eagle) could increase because of possible increases in future earnings, revenues and cash flow, increases in the underlying value of NewStar
or the payment of distributions that would accrue to First Eagle and Corsair.

 

 
•  NewStar will be relieved of the burdens on companies having publicly traded equity securities, including the pressure to meet analyst

forecasts and investor expectations, which may result in decisions to attempt to produce better short-term results, but which may not over the
long-term lead to a maximization of stockholder value.

 

 
•  Registration of NewStar’s shares under the Exchange Act will be terminated, which will reduce its legal and other costs related to complying

with certain filing and reporting obligations that the federal securities laws impose on public companies. First Eagle and Corsair will benefit
from any such cost savings realized by NewStar after it becomes a private company.

 

 

•  Any losses recognized upon the closing of the asset sale that do not result in tax refunds for NewStar will be allowed under applicable
income tax law to be carried forward and offset taxable income that may be generated following the closing by NewStar or First Eagle.
While such net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to limitations including the amount that can be used each year, the Tax Bill (as
further described in “—Recent Developments Potentially Affecting the Contingent Value Rights”) would permit carryforwards to be used in
perpetuity (and not subject to the current 20 year limit on such carryforwards).

The primary detriments of the merger and asset sale to NewStar, First Eagle and Corsair are the following:
 

 
•  The risk of any possible decrease in the earnings, revenues and cash flow, growth or the value of NewStar following the merger will be

borne by First Eagle and, indirectly, Corsair.

Table of Contents

 •  Following the merger, there will be no trading market for shares of NewStar stock.
 

 •  The risk that potential benefits sought as a result of the merger may not be realized.

Position of First Eagle as to the Fairness of the Merger

Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, the First Eagle Filing Persons may be deemed to be affiliates of NewStar, and, therefore,
they are required to express their beliefs as to the fairness of the merger to NewStar’s “unaffiliated security holders,” as defined under Rule 13e-3 of the
Exchange Act. The First Eagle Filing Persons are making the statements included in this section solely for the purpose of complying with the
requirements of Rule 13e-3 and the related rules under the Exchange Act. The views of each of the First Eagle Filing Persons should not be construed as
a recommendation to any NewStar stockholder as to how that stockholder should vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

The First Eagle Filing Persons attempted to negotiate with the NewStar board the terms of a transaction that would be most favorable to the First Eagle
Filing Persons, and not necessarily to NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders, and, accordingly, the First Eagle Filing Persons did not negotiate the merger
agreement with a goal of obtaining terms that were fair to such unaffiliated stockholders. The First Eagle Filing Persons did not participate in the
deliberations of the NewStar board regarding, or receive advice from NewStar’s legal or financial advisors as to, the substantive or procedural fairness
of the merger to NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders. The First Eagle Filing Persons have not performed, or engaged a financial advisor to perform, any
valuation or other analysis for the purposes of assessing the fairness of the merger to NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders.

Based on their knowledge and an evaluation of available information regarding NewStar, as well as discussions with NewStar regarding its business and
the factors considered by, and the analysis and resulting conclusions of, the NewStar board with respect to the merger as discussed in this proxy
statement under the heading “—Recommendation of the NewStar Board and Its Reasons for the Transactions; Fairness of the Transactions” beginning
on page 41 (which analysis and resulting conclusions with respect to the merger the First Eagle Filing Persons adopt), the First Eagle Filing Persons
believe that the merger is substantively and procedurally fair to NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders. In particular, the First Eagle Filing Persons believe
that the merger is both substantively and procedurally fair to NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders based on their consideration of the following factors,
among others, which are not listed in any relative order of importance:
 

 

•  the fact that the NewStar board includes five independent and disinterested directors of NewStar who are not affiliated with any of Corsair,
First Eagle, GSO or Blackstone, are not employees of NewStar or any of its affiliates and have no financial interest in the merger different
from, or in addition to the interests of, NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders other than their interests described under “—Interests of
NewStar’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions” beginning on page 82;

 

 
•  the fact that the NewStar board determined, by the unanimous vote of all members of the board (other than Mr. Thornburgh, who did not

participate in such determination), that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, are fair to, and in the
best interests of, NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders;

 

 
•  the fact that the Corsair Filing Persons did not participate in First Eagle’s negotiations with NewStar with respect to the merger, and the

Corsair designees on the First Eagle board of directors did not participate in any board deliberations of First Eagle relating to the merger;
 

 
•  the historical market prices of NewStar’s common stock as compared to the merger consideration, and NewStar’s return on equity as

compared to the industry;
 

 
•  the fact that the per share merger consideration to be received by the NewStar stockholders of (i) $11.44 in upfront cash and (ii) one

contingent value right, and the other terms and conditions of the merger agreement, resulted from vigorous negotiations between First Eagle
with the assistance of its advisors, on the one hand, and NewStar with the assistance of its advisors, on the other hand;

liquidity and value to NewStar’s stockholders, enabling NewStar’s

 stockholders to realize value that has been created at NewStar while eliminating long-term business and execution risk;
 

 

•  notwithstanding that the opinions of Credit Suisse and Houlihan Lokey were provided for the information and assistance of the NewStar
board and none of the First Eagle Filing Persons is entitled to, and did not, rely on such opinions, the fact that the NewStar board received
opinions from Credit Suisse and Houlihan Lokey, each dated October 16, 2017, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of
the date of such opinion, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of NewStar common stock (other than excluded holders (as
defined in such opinions) and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement;

 

 
•  the fact that all stockholders of NewStar, including the Corsair Filing Persons that beneficially own shares of NewStar common stock, will

receive the same consideration in the merger;
 

 

•  NewStar’s efforts to find a buyer for the company, which did not produce any buyer at a price equal to that provided by the GSO / First
Eagle transaction offers, as well as NewStar’s discussions with a variety of other parties regarding possible alternative transactions and its
consideration of numerous strategic alternatives, none of which resulted in an actionable alternative (all as further described in “—
Background of the Transactions” beginning on page 31 of this proxy statement);

 

 

•  the fact that until the no-shop period start date, NewStar had the right to solicit proposals or offers that constitute, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to such proposals or
offers (as further described in “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement—Merger Agreement—Go-Shop; No Solicitation”
beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement), and the fact that such solicitation activities did not result in the receipt of any acquisition
proposals;

 

 
•  the fact that, under certain circumstances, NewStar may engage in negotiations or discussions following the no-shop period start date with

any person that makes an acquisition proposal to NewStar (as further described in “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase
Agreement—Merger Agreement—Go-Shop; No Solicitation” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement);

 

 
•  the fact that NewStar may terminate the merger agreement and asset purchase agreement to accept a superior proposal subject to the

payment of a termination fee of either $10 million or $15 million in certain circumstances (as further described in “The Merger Agreement
and the Asset Purchase Agreement—Merger Agreement—Go-Shop; No Solicitation” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement);

 

 •  the fact that First Eagle’s obligations under the merger agreement are not subject to any financing condition;
 

 
•  the fact that stockholders who do not vote to adopt the merger agreement and who comply with the requirements of the DGCL will have the

right to demand appraisal of the fair value of their shares under the DGCL; and
 

 
•  the fact that the merger and asset sale are each subject to approval by the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding

shares of NewStar common stock, and almost 85% of such outstanding shares are held by unaffiliated stockholders.

In their consideration of the fairness of the merger, the First Eagle Filing Persons did not find it practicable to, and did not, appraise the assets of
NewStar to determine the liquidation value for the NewStar unaffiliated stockholders because (i) of their belief that liquidation sales generally result in
proceeds substantially less than the sales of a going concern, (ii) of the impracticability of determining a liquidation value given the significant
execution risk involved in any breakup, (iii) they considered NewStar to be a viable going concern and (iv) subject to the asset sale, NewStar will
continue to operate its business following the merger.

While First Eagle and GSO did consider the aggregate net book value and aggregate equity carrying value of certain investments held by NewStar as
part of their determination of the consideration payable in the merger and asset sale, the First Eagle Filing Persons did not consider the net book value of
NewStar, which is an accounting

concept, for purposes of determining the fairness of the merger consideration to NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders, because net book value does not
take into account the prospects of NewStar or trends or business risks inherent in its industry.

The First Eagle Filing Persons also did not seek to establish a pre-merger going concern value for the NewStar common stock to determine the fairness
of the merger consideration to NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders. The First Eagle Filing Persons believe that the trading price of the common stock at
any given time represents the best available indicator of NewStar’s going concern value at the time, so long as the trading price at that time is not
impacted by speculation regarding the likelihood of a potential transaction. To the extent the pre-merger going concern value was reflected in the price
of the NewStar common stock prior to the announcement of the merger, the merger consideration per share of common stock represented a premium to
the going concern value of NewStar.

None of the First Eagle Filing Persons was aware of, and thus did not consider in its fairness determination, any firm offers during the prior two years by
any person for (i) the merger or consolidation of NewStar with or into another company, (ii) the sale or transfer of all or a substantial part of NewStar’s
assets, or (iii) the purchase of NewStar’s securities that would enable the holder to exercise control of NewStar.

The foregoing is a summary of the information and factors considered by the First Eagle Filing Persons in connection with their evaluation of the
fairness of the merger to NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders, which is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all material factors
considered by the First Eagle Filing Persons. The First Eagle Filing Persons did not find it practicable to assign, and did not assign, quantify or
otherwise attach relative weights to the individual factors considered in reaching their conclusions as to the fairness of the merger. Rather, the First
Eagle Filing Persons made their fairness determination after considering all of the foregoing factors as a whole. The First Eagle Filing Persons believe
that these factors provide a reasonable basis for their belief that the merger is fair to NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders. This belief should not,
however, be construed as a recommendation to any NewStar stockholder to vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. None of the
First Eagle Filing Persons makes any recommendation as to how NewStar’s stockholders should vote their shares of common stock on any proposals to
be voted upon at the special meeting.

Position of the Corsair Filing Persons as to Fairness of the Merger

Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, the Corsair Filing Persons may be deemed to be affiliates of NewStar, and, therefore, they
are required to express their beliefs as to the fairness of the merger to NewStar’s “unaffiliated security holders,” as defined under Rule 13e-3 of the
Exchange Act. The Corsair Filing Persons are making the statements included in this section solely for the purpose of complying with the requirements
of Rule 13e-3 and the related rules under the Exchange Act. The views of each of the Corsair Filing Persons should not be construed as a
recommendation to any NewStar stockholder as to how that stockholder should vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

As described under the heading “—Background of the Transactions” beginning on page 31, Mr. Richard E. Thornburgh, a senior advisor to Corsair and
a director of NewStar, did not participate in any board deliberations of NewStar relating to the merger. None of the Corsair Filing Persons participated in
the negotiations with NewStar with respect to the merger, including the price to be paid to NewStar’s stockholders in the merger. In addition, the Corsair
designees on the board of directors of First Eagle did not participate in any board deliberations of First Eagle relating to the merger.

The Corsair Filing Persons did not participate in the deliberations of the NewStar board regarding, or receive any advice from NewStar’s legal or
financial advisors as to, the substantive or procedural fairness of the merger to NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders. The Corsair Filing Persons have not
performed, or engaged a financial advisor to perform, any valuation or other analysis for the purposes of assessing the fairness of the merger to
NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders. No financial advisor provided the Corsair Filing Persons with any analysis, opinion or appraisal with respect to the
fairness of the merger consideration to the unaffiliated stockholders.

Based on its knowledge and analysis of available information regarding NewStar, as well as the factors considered by, and the analyses and resulting
conclusions of, the NewStar board discussed under

“—Recommendation of the NewStar Board and Its Reasons for the Transactions; Fairness of the Transactions” beginning on page 41 (which analysis
and resulting conclusions with respect to the merger the Corsair Filing Persons adopt), each Corsair Filing Person believes that the merger is
substantively and procedurally fair to NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders based on its consideration of the following factors, which are not listed in any
relative order of importance:
 

 

•  the fact that the NewStar board includes five independent and disinterested directors of NewStar who are not affiliated with any of Corsair,
First Eagle, GSO or Blackstone, are not employees of NewStar or any of its affiliates and have no financial interest in the merger different
from, or in addition to the interests of, NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders other than their interests described under “—Interests of
NewStar’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions” beginning on page 82;

 

 
•  the NewStar board determined, by the unanimous vote of all members of the board (other than Mr. Thornburgh, who did not participate in

such determination), that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, are fair to, and in the best interests
of, NewStar’s unaffiliated stockholders;

 

 
•  the Corsair Filing Persons did not participate in or seek to influence the deliberative process of, or the conclusions reached by, the NewStar

board or the negotiating positions of the NewStar board;
 

 
•  the NewStar board had no obligation to recommend the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated

by the merger agreement, including the merger, or any other transaction;
 

 
•  the NewStar board was fully informed about the extent to which the interests of certain stockholders of NewStar who are also Corsair Filing

Persons in the merger differed from those of the unaffiliated stockholders;
 

 
•  the NewStar board determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are in the best

interests of the unaffiliated stockholders;
 

 
•  NewStar common stock traded as low as $8.03 per share during the 52-week period prior to the announcement of the execution of the

merger agreement;
 

 
•  the merger consideration, other terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,

including the merger, were the result of extensive negotiations over an extended period of time between NewStar with the assistance of its
advisors on the one side and GSO and First Eagle with the assistance of their advisors on the other side;

 

 

•  notwithstanding that the opinions of Credit Suisse and Houlihan Lokey were provided for the information and assistance of the NewStar
board and none of the Corsair Filing Persons are entitled to, and did not, rely on such opinions, the fact that the board received opinions
from Credit Suisse and Houlihan Lokey, each dated October 16, 2017, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of
such opinion, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of NewStar common stock (other than excluded holders (as defined in
such opinions) and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement;

 

 

•  the recognition of the potential disadvantages that NewStar would continue to face as an SEC-reporting public company, including
continuing to be subject to the (i) regulatory compliance costs; and (ii) requirement to disclose a considerable amount of business
information to the public, some of which would otherwise be considered competitively sensitive and would not be disclosed by a non-
reporting company and which potentially may help NewStar’s actual or potential competitors, customers, lenders and vendors compete
against NewStar or make it more difficult for NewStar to negotiate favorable terms with them, as the case may be;

 

 
•  NewStar, under certain circumstances as set out in the merger agreement, is able to specifically enforce the terms of the merger agreement;

and
 

 
•  the merger is not conditioned on any financing being obtained by GSO or First Eagle, thus increasing the likelihood that the merger will be

consummated and the merger consideration will be paid to the unaffiliated stockholders.

As stated above, the Corsair Filing Persons did not participate in any board or other deliberations on either the NewStar or GSO / First Eagle side
regarding the merger, including the price to be paid to NewStar’s stockholders. However, in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and the
related rules under the Exchange Act, the Corsair Filings Persons hereby confirm the following:
 

 

•  The Corsair Filing Persons did not consider NewStar’s net book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities, as a factor. The
Corsair Filing Persons believe that net book value, which is an accounting concept based on historical costs, is not a material indicator of the
value of NewStar as a going concern because it does not take into account the future prospects of NewStar, market conditions, trends in the
industry in which NewStar conducts its business or the business risks inherent in competing with other companies in the same industry.

 

 
•  In its consideration of the fairness of the merger, the Corsair Filing Persons did not consider NewStar’s liquidation value to be a relevant

valuation method because it considers NewStar to be a viable, going concern business where value is derived from cash flows generated
from its continuing operations and because NewStar will continue to operate its business following the merger.

 

 

•  The Corsair Filing Persons did not seek to establish a pre-merger going concern value for NewStar common stock to determine the fairness
of the merger consideration to the unaffiliated stockholders. Each of the Corsair Filing Persons believes that the trading price of the common
stock at any given time represents the best available indicator of NewStar’s going concern value at the time, so long as the trading price of
that time is not impacted by speculation regarding the likelihood of a potential transaction. To the extent the pre-merger going concern value
was reflected in the pre-announcement price of NewStar common stock, the merger consideration represented a premium to the going
concern value of NewStar.

 

 

•  Each of the Corsair Filing Persons is not aware of, and thus did not consider in its fairness determination, any offers or proposals made by
any unaffiliated third parties with respect to (a) a merger or consolidation of NewStar with or into another company, (b) a sale of all or a
substantial part of NewStar’s assets or (c) the purchase of the NewStar voting securities that would enable the holder to exercise control over
the Company.

 

 
•  The Corsair Filing Persons did not perform or receive any independent reports, opinions or appraisals from any third party related to the

merger, and thus did not consider any such reports, opinions or appraisals in determining the substantive and procedural fairness of the
merger to the unaffiliated stockholders.

The foregoing is a summary of the information and factors considered and given weight by each of the Corsair Filing Persons in connection with its
evaluation of the substantive and procedural fairness of the merger to the unaffiliated stockholders, which is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes
all material factors considered by the Corsair Filing Persons. The Corsair Filing Persons did not find it practicable to assign, and did not assign, relative
weights to the individual factors considered in reaching their conclusion as to the substantive and procedural fairness of the merger to the unaffiliated
stockholders. Rather, its fairness determination was made after consideration of all of the foregoing factors as a whole.

Each of the Corsair Filing Persons believes these factors provide a reasonable basis for its belief that the merger is substantively and procedurally fair to
the unaffiliated stockholders. This belief should not, however, be construed as a recommendation to any stockholder of NewStar to vote in favor of the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. None of the Corsair Filing Persons makes any recommendation as to how stockholders of NewStar should vote
their shares of NewStar common stock on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Purpose and Reasons of First Eagle and Corsair for the Merger

Under the SEC rules governing “going-private” transactions, each of the Corsair Filing Persons and First Eagle Filing Persons may be deemed to be
affiliates of NewStar, and, therefore, they are required to express their purposes and reasons for the merger to NewStar’s “unaffiliated security holders,”
as defined under Rule 13e-3 of

the Exchange Act. The Corsair Filing Persons and First Eagle Filing Persons are making the statements included in this section solely for the purpose of
complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and the related rules under the Exchange Act. The views of each of the Corsair Filing Persons and First
Eagle Filing Persons should not be construed as a recommendation to any NewStar stockholder as to how that stockholder should vote their shares of
common stock on any proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting.

If the merger is completed, NewStar will become an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of First Eagle, and the common stock of NewStar will cease to
be publicly traded. For the First Eagle Filing Persons, the primary purpose of the merger is to allow First Eagle to indirectly own equity interests in
NewStar and to bear the rewards and risks of such ownership after the merger is completed and the NewStar common stock ceases to be publicly traded.
First Eagle has been interested in expanding its investment platform to include fundamental capabilities in corporate and middle market credit investing
in order to enhance its ability to serve both institutional and retail investors through many life cycles and market cycles. First Eagle expects that,
following completion of the merger, First Eagle will be able to expand its asset management platform by providing NewStar’s credit strategies to
institutional and retail investors. First Eagle decided to undertake the merger at this time given GSO’s interest in contemporaneously acquiring a
portfolio of NewStar’s investment assets, which provided an opportunity for First Eagle to pursue a transaction with NewStar. For the Corsair Filing
Persons, the primary purpose of the merger is to receive the merger consideration. In addition to the reasons cited in the section above entitled “—
Recommendation of the NewStar Board and Its Reasons for the Transactions; Fairness of the Transactions” beginning on page 41 of this proxy
statement, the Corsair Filing Persons believe that this is the appropriate time to sell NewStar in light of the fact that (a) the NewStar board has
endeavored on multiple occasions over the past four years to sell the company (or find another compelling strategic alternative) (as described in “—
Background of the Transactions” beginning on page 31 of this proxy statement) and (b) the Corsair Filing Persons believe the sale of NewStar to be the
value maximizing alternative relative to the value proposition for NewStar’s stockholders as a standalone public company.

The First Eagle Filing Persons believe that structuring the merger as described in this proxy statement is preferable to other transaction structures
because it (i) will enable First Eagle to indirectly acquire all of the outstanding NewStar common stock at the same time, (ii) will allow NewStar to
cease to be a publicly registered and reporting company, and (iii) represents an opportunity for NewStar’s stockholders to receive cash for their shares of
common stock. The First Eagle Filing Persons did not consider any other alternative transaction structures or other alternative means to accomplish the
foregoing purposes, other than a potential purchase of the assets related to NewStar’s asset management platform. The NewStar board rejected the asset
purchase structure and requested that First Eagle instead develop a proposal that involved a merger or other acquisition of shares from NewStar’s
stockholders (as further described in “—Background of the Transactions” beginning on page 31 of this proxy statement).

Plans for NewStar After the Merger

If the merger is consummated, the First Eagle Filing Persons currently anticipate that NewStar’s operations initially will be conducted following the
closing substantially in the same manner as they are currently being conducted, except for (i) changes resulting from the consummation of the asset sale,
(ii) NewStar ceasing to be a public company and instead being an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of First Eagle, (iii) the repayment of certain debt of
NewStar in connection with the closing, and (iv) NewStar ceasing to pay a quarterly dividend. The First Eagle Filing Persons are currently conducting a
review of NewStar and its business and operations with a view towards determining how to improve NewStar’s long-term earnings potential (including
by reducing NewStar’s costs and expenses related to being a public company following the merger) as part of the First Eagle platform, and expect to
complete such review following consummation of the merger. Except as described in this proxy statement, the First Eagle Filing Persons have advised
NewStar that they do not have any current intentions, plans or proposals to cause NewStar to engage in any of the following:
 

 
•  any extraordinary corporate transaction following consummation of the merger involving NewStar’s corporate structure, business or

management, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation;
 

 •  the purchase, sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of NewStar or any of its subsidiaries; or
 

 •  any other material changes to NewStar’s corporate structure or business.

Table of Contents

Following consummation of the merger, the First Eagle Filing Persons will continue to assess NewStar’s assets, corporate and capital structure,
capitalization, operations, business, properties and personnel to determine what additional changes, if any, would be desirable following the merger to
enhance the business and operations of NewStar. The First Eagle Filing Persons reserve the right to make any changes to NewStar’s operations after the
consummation of the merger that they deem appropriate in light of additional evaluation and review or in light of future developments.

Certain Effects of the Merger

The tables below set forth the direct and indirect interests in NewStar’s net book value and net income of the Corsair Filing Persons and the First Eagle
Filing Persons prior to and immediately after consummation of the proposed merger based on NewStar’s net book value at December 31, 2016 and

Opinions of NewStar’s Financial Advisors

Opinion of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC

NewStar has engaged Credit Suisse to act as a financial advisor to NewStar in connection with the proposed transaction. In connection with this
engagement, the board requested that Credit Suisse evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by
holders of NewStar common stock (other than excluded holders and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement. On October 16, 2017,
at a meeting of the board held to evaluate the proposed transaction, Credit Suisse rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion
dated October 16, 2017, to the board to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken, the merger consideration to be received by holders of NewStar common
stock (other than excluded holders and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. For purposes of Credit Suisse’s analyses and opinion, the term “excluded holders” refers to, collectively, certain investors in First Eagle
Investment Management, LLC, including Corsair, Bleichroeder and Blackstone, First Eagle Investment Management, LLC, First Eagle, FE Holdco and
their respective investors, and certain other parties involved in the transaction and related transactions, and/or certain of their respective affiliates,
portfolio companies, sub-advisors, managers and/or managed or related entities, including GSO Capital Partners LP and FS Investment Corporation.

The full text of Credit Suisse’s written opinion, dated October 16, 2017, to the board, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken by Credit Suisse in connection with
such opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference in its entirety. The
description of Credit Suisse’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Credit Suisse’s
opinion. Credit Suisse’s opinion was provided to the board (in its capacity as such) for its information in connection with its evaluation of the
merger consideration from a financial point of view and did not address the asset sale or any other terms, aspects or implications of the
proposed merger, the relative merits of the transaction or related transactions as compared to alternative transactions or strategies that might
be available to NewStar or the underlying business decision of the board or NewStar to proceed with the transaction or related transactions.
Credit Suisse’s opinion does not constitute advice or a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act on any
matter relating to the proposed transaction or otherwise.

In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse reviewed drafts, dated October 15, 2017 and October 16, 2017, of the merger agreement and the asset purchase
agreement, respectively, and certain publicly available business and financial information relating to NewStar. Credit Suisse also reviewed certain other
information relating to NewStar provided to or discussed with Credit Suisse by the management of NewStar, including financial forecasts and estimates
relating to NewStar prepared by the management of NewStar, which we refer to as the “forecasts”, as well as certain tax information relating to NewStar
provided to Credit Suisse by the management of NewStar as reviewed and discussed by the management of NewStar with NewStar’s tax advisors,
including estimates and other information as to certain potential tax attributes of NewStar, potential tax refunds anticipated to be received by NewStar as
a result of, and in connection with, the asset sale, and underlying assumptions with respect to the contingent value right, which we refer to as the “tax
information”, and Credit Suisse met with the management of NewStar to discuss the businesses and prospects of NewStar. Credit Suisse also considered
certain financial and stock market data of NewStar, and Credit Suisse compared that data with similar data for companies with publicly traded equity
securities in businesses Credit Suisse deemed relevant, and Credit Suisse considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain other
business combinations and transactions which had been effected or announced. Credit Suisse also considered such other information, financial studies,
analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria which it deemed relevant.

In connection with its review, Credit Suisse did not independently verify any of the foregoing information and Credit Suisse assumed and relied upon
such information being complete and accurate in all material respects. With respect to the forecasts and the tax information that Credit Suisse was
directed to utilize in its analyses, Credit Suisse was advised by the management of NewStar, and Credit Suisse assumed, with NewStar’s consent, that
such forecasts and tax information were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of such
management as to the future financial performance of NewStar and the other matters covered thereby and were appropriate for Credit Suisse’s use and
reliance for purposes of its analyses and opinion. With respect to the tax information, including, without limitation, as to tax filings and potential tax
refunds, Credit Suisse also assumed, with NewStar’s consent, that (i) all applicable tax filings and claims for refunds would be timely made on behalf of
NewStar, (ii) such potential tax refunds would be received by NewStar in full in the amounts and at the times indicated by the management of NewStar,
(iii) such potential tax refunds would be paid to NewStar’s stockholders in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement in the amounts and at the
times contemplated therein without adjustment, delay or condition and (iv) the tax information regarding such tax filings, potential tax refunds,
including the amounts and timing of such potential tax refunds, and any other tax matters relevant to the contingent value right or otherwise was
consistent with the advice received by NewStar from its tax advisors. Credit Suisse expressed no opinion as to any forecasts or tax information
(including, without limitation, as to potential tax refunds or the amounts or timing thereof) or the assumptions on which they were based. Credit Suisse
relied, with NewStar’s consent and without independent verification, upon the assessments of the management of NewStar as to, among other things,
(A) the asset sale, including with respect to the timing thereof and the assets, liabilities and financial and other terms involved, (B) the financial and
other terms associated with the contingent value right, including, without limitation, the likelihood, amount and timing of payments pursuant to the
contingent value right, (C) the potential impact on

relationships of NewStar. Credit Suisse assumed, with NewStar’s consent, that there would be no developments with respect to any such matters that
would have an adverse effect on NewStar or the transaction or that otherwise would be meaningful in any respect to Credit Suisse’s analyses or opinion.

In connection with its opinion, Credit Suisse was not requested to make, and it did not make, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (contingent, accrued, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise) of NewStar or any other entity, nor was Credit Suisse furnished for purposes
of its analyses or opinion with any such evaluations or appraisals, and Credit Suisse’s analyses should not be construed as such. Credit Suisse is not an
appraiser or an expert in the evaluation of, nor did Credit Suisse express any view or opinion as to, any loan portfolios or individual credit files or the
adequacy or sufficiency of allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses, provisions for loan losses, loan loss reserves or any other similar matters.
Credit Suisse was advised by the management of NewStar and therefore Credit Suisse assumed, with NewStar’s consent, that any such allowances,
provisions and reserves were in the aggregate adequate and sufficient to cover such losses. Credit Suisse also was not requested to make, and it did not
make, an evaluation of the solvency or fair value of NewStar, First Eagle Investment Management, LLC or any other entity under any state, federal or
other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters.

Credit Suisse assumed, with NewStar’s consent, that, in the course of obtaining any regulatory or third-party consents, approvals, agreements or waivers
in connection with the transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications,
would be imposed or occur that would have an adverse effect on NewStar or the transaction or that otherwise would be meaningful in any respect to
Credit Suisse’s analyses or opinion and that the transaction would be consummated on or prior to March 31, 2018 and otherwise consummated in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the asset purchase agreement and related documents and in compliance with all applicable laws,
documents and other requirements without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof. Representatives of
NewStar advised Credit Suisse, and Credit Suisse also assumed, with NewStar’s consent, that the terms of the merger agreement and the asset purchase
agreement, when executed, would conform in all material respects to the terms reflected in the drafts reviewed by Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse did not
express any opinion with respect to accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters and Credit Suisse assumed that NewStar had or would obtain
such advice or opinions from appropriate professional sources, and Credit Suisse relied, with NewStar’s consent, upon the assessments of
representatives of NewStar as to such matters.

Credit Suisse’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of its date, of the merger consideration (to the extent expressly
specified in such opinion), without taking into account any premium or discount for control, liquidity or otherwise, including any illiquidity discount
with respect to the contingent value right or any interest income on any undistributed portion of applicable tax refunds, and without regard to individual
circumstances of specific holders with respect to any rights or aspects which may distinguish such holders or the securities of NewStar held by such
holders. Credit Suisse’s opinion did not in any way address any other consideration to be received in connection with the transaction or related
transactions or proportionate allocation or relative fairness. Credit Suisse’s opinion also did not address the asset sale or any other terms, aspects or
implications of the merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger, the form or structure, or financial or other terms of, the
asset sale, the form of the merger consideration or any terms, aspects or implications of any sub-advisory, investment management, servicing or other
agreement, arrangement or understanding to be entered into in connection with, related to or contemplated by the transaction, any related transactions or
otherwise. In addition, Credit Suisse’s opinion did not address the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspect relating to, any compensation
or other consideration to any officers, directors, employees or stockholders of any party to the transaction or related transactions or any related entities,
or class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. The issuance of Credit Suisse’s opinion was approved by Credit Suisse’s
authorized internal committee.

Table of Contents

Credit Suisse’s opinion was necessarily based upon information made available to Credit Suisse as of the date of Credit Suisse’s opinion and financial,
economic, market and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on that date. As the board was aware, the credit, financial and stock
markets, the industries and markets in which NewStar and its customers operate, and the trading prices of NewStar common stock, have experienced
and continue to experience volatility and Credit Suisse expressed no view or opinion as to any potential effects of such volatility on NewStar, NewStar
common stock or the transaction. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect Credit Suisse’s opinion, and Credit Suisse does not
have any obligation to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion. Credit Suisse did not express any opinion as to the actual value of the contingent
value right when issued or actual payment amounts when received pursuant to the contingent value right or the prices at which NewStar common stock
or other securities would trade or be transferable at any time, including following consummation of the transaction. In connection with Credit Suisse’s
engagement, Credit Suisse was not requested to, and it did not, undertake a third-party solicitation process on behalf of NewStar with respect to the
acquisition of all or a part of NewStar; however, at the direction of the board, Credit Suisse was requested, following public announcement of the
transaction and as contemplated by the terms thereof, to undertake a go-shop process on behalf of NewStar to solicit third-party indications of interest in
the acquisition of NewStar. Credit Suisse’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the transaction or related transactions as compared to
alternative transactions or strategies that might be available to NewStar, nor did it address the underlying business decision of the board or NewStar to
proceed with the transaction or related transactions.

In preparing its opinion to the board, Credit Suisse performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those described below. The
summary of Credit Suisse’s analyses described below is not a complete description of the analyses underlying Credit Suisse’s opinion. The preparation
of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Credit Suisse arrived at its ultimate opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in
isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis. Accordingly, Credit Suisse believes that its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering
all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its
analyses and opinion.

In its analyses, Credit Suisse considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of NewStar, First Eagle and the other parties involved in the transaction and related transactions. No company, business or
transaction used for comparative purposes in Credit Suisse’s analyses is identical to NewStar or the merger, and an evaluation of the results of those
analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions analyzed.
The estimates contained in Credit Suisse’s analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of
actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In
addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities
actually may be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Credit Suisse’s analyses are inherently subject to
substantial uncertainty.

Credit Suisse was not requested to, and it did not, determine or recommend the merger consideration, which was determined through negotiations
among NewStar, First Eagle and certain related entities, and the decision to enter into the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement was solely
that of the board. Credit Suisse’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of many factors considered by the board in its evaluation of the merger
consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the board or management with respect to the transaction or the consideration
payable in the transaction.

Financial Analyses

The summary of the financial analyses described in this section entitled “—Financial Analyses” is a summary of the material financial analyses
reviewed by Credit Suisse with the board on October 16, 2017 in connection with Credit Suisse’s opinion. The financial analyses summarized below
include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Credit Suisse’s financial analyses, the tables must be read
together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the
data in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Credit Suisse’s financial analyses. For purposes of the
analyses described below, the term (i) “implied CVR value” refers to implied present value ranges for the contingent value right (derived using a
selected range of discount rates of 6.0% to 10.0%), based on the tax information, including the amounts and timing of potential tax refunds anticipated
to be received by NewStar as a result of, and in connection with, the asset sale, of approximately $0.74 to $0.91 on a per share basis assuming the
transaction closes by December 31, 2017 (with the low-end of such range reflecting NewStar management’s timing assumption of the distribution of
remaining proceeds of a tax refund to NewStar’s stockholders three years from the applicable tax filing date, referred to as the “three-year tax refund
distribution date”, and the high-end of such range reflecting NewStar management’s timing assumption of the distribution of remaining proceeds of a tax
refund to NewStar’s stockholders nine months from the applicable tax filing date, referred to as the “nine-month tax refund distribution date”), and
approximately $0.65 to $0.80 on a per share basis assuming the transaction closes during the first quarter (ending March 31, 2018) of NewStar’s fiscal
year 2018 (with the low-end of such range reflecting NewStar management’s three-year tax refund distribution date assumption and the high-end of such
range reflecting NewStar management’s nine-month tax refund distribution date assumption), (ii) “implied per share merger consideration reference
ranges” refers to the cash consideration of $11.44 per share and the applicable implied CVR value and (iii) “June 30, 2017 adjusted tangible book value”
refers to the tangible book value of NewStar as of June 30, 2017, based on public filings and other publicly available information, adjusted for cash used
to repurchase shares of NewStar common stock and cash proceeds received by NewStar from the exercise of NewStar stock options during the period
from July 1, 2017 through October 16, 2017 per NewStar management. The financial analyses described below performed in connection with Credit
Suisse’s opinion, dated October 16, 2017, to the board do not address the potential impact, if any, of the Tax Bill or any other changes in tax or other
laws on NewStar or any other entity or on the consideration payable in the transaction.

October 16, 2017 Financial Presentation

The financial presentation provided to the board in connection with Credit Suisse’s opinion, dated October 16, 2017, to the board, referred to as the
October 16, 2017 financial presentation, included the following material financial analyses:

Selected Public Companies Analysis. Credit Suisse reviewed certain financial and stock market information relating to NewStar and the following
17 selected publicly traded business development companies, which we refer to as “BDCs”, in the middle-market lending and asset management
industries with business characteristics, including product mix and loan origination capability, that Credit Suisse considered generally similar to those of
NewStar, consisting of three selected publicly traded BDCs that are internally managed, which we collectively refer to as the “selected internally-
managed BDCs”, and 14 selected publicly traded BDCs that are externally managed, which we collectively refer to as the “selected externally-managed
BDCs” and, together with the selected internally-managed BDCs, which we refer to as the “selected BDCs”:
 

Selected Internally-Managed BDCs   Selected Externally-Managed BDCs
•    Hercules Capital, Inc.   •    Apollo Investment Corporation

•    Main Street Capital Corporation   •    Ares Capital Corporation

•    Triangle Capital Corporation   •    BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation

  •    FS Investment Corporation

  •    Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.

  •    Golub Capital BDC, Inc.

  •    Prospect Capital Corporation

  •    Solar Capital Ltd.

  •    TCG BDC, Inc.

  •    TCP Capital Corp.

  •    TPG Specialty Lending, Inc.

Credit Suisse reviewed, among other information, closing stock prices as of October 13, 2017 as a multiple of reported tangible book value per share as
of June 30, 2017. Financial data of the selected BDCs were based on public filings, publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates and other
publicly available information. Financial data of NewStar was based on information relating to NewStar provided by the management of NewStar and
public filings, publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ estimates and other publicly available information.

Credit Suisse observed that NewStar’s June 30, 2017 adjusted tangible book value per share multiple was 0.79x. The overall low to high June 30, 2017
tangible book value per share multiples (and mean and median multiples) observed for the selected BDCs, including the overall low to high June 30,
2017 tangible book value per share multiples (and mean and median multiples) observed for the selected internally-managed BDCs and the selected
externally-managed BDCs, were as follows:
 

Selected BDCs   Low    High    Mean    Median 
June 30, 2017 tangible book value per share    0.67x    1.76x    1.05x    1.00x 

Selected Internally-Managed BDCs                 
June 30, 2017 tangible book value per share    0.93x    1.76x    1.33x    1.29x 

Selected Externally-Managed BDCs                 
June 30, 2017 tangible book value per share    0.67x    1.29x    0.99x    1.00x 

Credit Suisse also observed, among other things, for informational purposes, the calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated returns on
average equity (“ROAE”) of NewStar and the selected BDCs based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ mean estimates, which indicated
calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated ROAE for NewStar of approximately 2.8% and 4.4%, respectively, and calendar year 2017 and
calendar year 2018 estimated ROAE for the selected BDCs, to the extent meaningful and publicly available, of (i) in the case of calendar year 2017
estimated ROAE, an overall range of approximately 6.9% to 12.9% (with a mean of 9.8% and a median of 10.0%) for the selected BDCs, with a
calendar year 2017 estimated ROAE range of approximately 11.2% to 11.5% (with a mean and a median of 11.3%) for the selected internally-managed
BDCs and a calendar year 2017 estimated ROAE range of approximately 6.9% to 12.9% (with a mean of 9.5% and a median of 9.4%) for the selected
externally-managed BDCs, and (ii) in the case of the calendar year 2018 estimated ROAE, an overall range of approximately 7.7% to 12.8% (with a
mean of 9.8% and a median of 9.9%) for the selected BDCs, with a calendar year 2018 estimated ROAE range of approximately 11.3% to 12.8% (with a
mean and a median of 12.1%) for the selected internally-managed BDCs and a calendar year 2018 estimated ROAE range of approximately 7.7% to
11.1% (with a mean of 9.4% and a median of 9.6%) for the selected externally-managed BDCs.

Credit Suisse then applied a selected range of June 30, 2017 tangible book value multiples of 0.70x to 0.90x derived from the selected BDCs to the
June 30, 2017 adjusted tangible book value of NewStar. Approximate implied per share equity values for NewStar derived from such selected range of
June 30, 2017 tangible book value multiples were calculated as total implied equity value divided by the total number of fully diluted shares of NewStar
common stock estimated by the management of NewStar to be outstanding as of October 16, 2017. This analysis indicated the following approximate
implied per share equity value reference range for NewStar, as compared to the implied per share merger consideration reference ranges:

of FY2018
$10.49 – $13.28    $12.18 – $12.35    $12.09 – $12.24  

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. Credit Suisse reviewed publicly available financial information relating to the following two selected
transactions involving target BDCs in the middle-market lending and asset management industries with business characteristics that Credit Suisse
considered generally similar to those of NewStar, which we collectively refer to as the “selected transactions”:
 
Announcement Date   Acquiror   Target
10/3/16   CĪON Investment Corporation   Credit Suisse Park View BDC, Inc.
5/23/16   Ares Capital Corporation/American Capital Agency Corp.   American Capital, Ltd.

Credit Suisse reviewed, among other information, transaction values in the selected transactions, based on the purchase prices paid in the selected
transactions, as a multiple of the target company’s latest reported tangible book value prior to the announcement date of the relevant transaction.
Financial data (pro forma, in the case of the CĪON Investment Corporation/Credit Suisse Park View BDC, Inc. transaction, for the assignment of certain
assets from CĪON Investment Corporation to Credit Suisse Park View BDC, Inc. post-closing) of the selected transactions were based on public filings
and other publicly available information. Financial data of NewStar was based on information relating to NewStar provided by the management of
NewStar and public filings and other publicly available information.

Credit Suisse noted, for informational purposes, an additional transaction involving a target BDC in the middle-market lending and asset management
industries, the Pennant Park Floating Rate Capital Ltd./MCG Capital Corporation transaction announced on April 29, 2015, which indicated an implied
latest reported tangible book value multiple paid in such transaction of 0.99x; however, given MCG Capital Corporation’s high concentration of cash
(relative to total assets) resulting from the liquidation of its business, Credit Suisse viewed such company and implied tangible book value multiple as
not meaningful for purposes of analysis.

Credit Suisse observed that NewStar’s June 30, 2017 adjusted tangible book value per share multiple was 0.79x. The overall low to high latest reported
tangible book value multiples (and mean and median multiples) observed for the selected transactions were as follows:
 

Selected Transactions   Low    High    Mean    Median 
Latest reported tangible book value    0.89x    0.94x    0.92x    0.92x 

Credit Suisse then applied a selected range of latest reported tangible book value multiples derived from the selected transactions of 0.80x to 0.90x to
the June 30, 2017 adjusted tangible book value of NewStar. Approximate implied per share equity values for NewStar derived from such range of
selected latest reported tangible book value multiples were calculated as total implied equity value divided by the total number of fully diluted shares of
NewStar common stock estimated by the management of NewStar to be outstanding as of

October 16, 2017. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for NewStar, as compared to the
implied per share merger consideration reference ranges:

Dividend Discount Analysis. Credit Suisse performed a dividend discount analysis of NewStar to calculate the estimated present value of the
distributed cash flows that NewStar was forecasted to generate during the last two quarters of NewStar’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 through
the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 based on financial forecasts and estimates relating to NewStar prepared by the management of NewStar.
Credit Suisse calculated terminal values for NewStar by applying a selected range of tangible book value multiples of 0.75x to 0.95x to NewStar’s
estimated tangible book value as of December 31, 2020. The present values (as of June 30, 2017) of the distributed cash flows and terminal values were
then calculated using a selected range of discount rates of 7.0% to 10.0%. Approximate implied per share equity values for NewStar were calculated as
total implied equity value divided by the total number of fully diluted shares of NewStar common stock estimated by the management of NewStar to be
outstanding as of October 16, 2017. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for NewStar, as
compared to the implied per share merger consideration reference ranges:

Certain Additional Information

Credit Suisse observed certain additional information that was not considered part of Credit Suisse’s financial analyses with respect to its opinion but
was noted for informational purposes, including the following:
 

 
•  historical trading prices of NewStar common stock during the 52-week period ended October 13, 2017, which indicated low and high

intraday prices for NewStar common stock during such period of approximately $8.03 and $12.51 per share, respectively; and
 

 
•  price targets for NewStar common stock as reflected in selected publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ reports, each dated

August 2, 2017, which indicated an overall low to high target stock price range of $12.00 to $14.00 per share.

Preliminary Discussion Materials

In addition to the October 16, 2017 financial presentation provided to the board in connection with Credit Suisse’s opinion, dated October 16, 2017, to
the board as summarized above, Credit Suisse also provided, for informational purposes, certain preliminary discussion materials to the board as
summarized below. The preliminary financial considerations and other information in the preliminary discussion materials reflected market data as of
dates proximate to such materials and were based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and
information, including tax information relating to NewStar, made available to Credit Suisse as of, the date of such materials. Accordingly, to the extent
preliminary financial analyses or information were included in such preliminary discussion materials, such preliminary financial analyses or information
may have differed from the October 16, 2017 financial presentation as a result of, among other things, changes in NewStar’s internal financial forecasts,
estimates and assumptions, such financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances and other information. Credit Suisse
also continued to refine various aspects of such preliminary financial considerations and other information. The October 16, 2017 financial presentation
superseded the preliminary discussion materials.

Table of Contents

None of the preliminary discussion materials constituted an opinion of, or recommendation by, Credit Suisse with respect to a possible transaction or
otherwise. Credit Suisse noted for the board that it does not provide tax advice and that any board materials, preliminary or otherwise, that included tax
information were based on tax information and assumptions provided to or discussed with Credit Suisse by the management of NewStar and/or by
NewStar management in consultation with its tax advisors.
 

 

•  November 20, 2017 Preliminary Discussion Materials. The November 20, 2017 preliminary discussion materials reflected, for illustrative
purposes, the potential theoretical impact on NewStar of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” legislation proposed by the U.S. House of
Representatives Committee on Ways and Means based on NewStar management’s financial forecasts and estimates under two hypothetical
scenarios, the first of which assumed the transaction had not been contemplated and the second of which assumed termination of the
contemplated transaction. The November 20, 2017 preliminary discussion materials included, among other things, hypothetical sensitivities
to NewStar management’s financial forecasts and estimates for NewStar on a standalone basis, taking into account the potential theoretical
effects of such proposed legislation if enacted and certain assumptions of NewStar’s management including, illustratively, a reduction in
NewStar’s implied marginal corporate tax rate, a write-off by NewStar of a portion of its deferred tax assets and a 50% dividend payout ratio
on incremental net income, which indicated, in the two hypothetical scenarios described above, that NewStar’s fiscal year 2018 estimated
after-tax ROAE would decrease from approximately 4.5% to 3.7% in the first scenario and from approximately 4.5% to 1.5% in the second
scenario, NewStar’s fiscal year estimated 2019 and fiscal year estimated 2020 after-tax ROAE would increase from approximately 4.8% to
5.7% and approximately 6.0% to 7.1%, respectively, in the first scenario and from approximately 4.8% to 5.9% and approximately 6.0% to
7.2%, respectively, in the second scenario and, in the second scenario, that transaction-related termination costs would offset, through
NewStar’s fiscal year 2020 (the end of the projected period reflected in NewStar management’s forecasts), the incremental net income
resulting from a reduction in NewStar’s implied marginal corporate tax rate.

 

 
•  October 7, 2017 Preliminary Discussion Materials. The October 7, 2017 preliminary discussion materials were substantially similar to the

October 16, 2017 financial presentation and contained, among other things:
 

 

•  a preliminary selected public companies analysis, a preliminary selected precedent transactions analysis and a preliminary dividend
discount analysis of NewStar, which preliminary financial analyses generally used the same methodologies and indicated the same
approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges as described above under “—October 16, 2017 Financial
Presentation”;

 

 
•  historical trading prices of NewStar common stock during the 52-week period ended October 3, 2017, which indicated low and high

intraday prices for NewStar common stock during such period of approximately $8.03 and $11.99 per share, respectively; and
 

 
•  price targets for NewStar common stock as reflected in selected publicly available Wall Street research analysts’ reports, each dated

August 2, 2017, which indicated an overall low to high target stock price range of $12.00 to $14.00 per share.
 

 •  August 31, 2017 Preliminary Discussion Materials. The August 31, 2017 preliminary discussion materials included, among other things:
 

 

•  an update on NewStar’s discussions with GSO/First Eagle Investment Management, LLC and an overview of the indication of
interest received by NewStar from GSO/First Eagle Investment Management, LLC and Party B’s July 5, 2017 indication of interest
for an acquisition of NewStar’s common stock at a price of $12.00 per share in cash (which indication of interest had not been
updated since July 5, 2017 and was referenced for informational purposes), and certain related considerations, which overview
indicated, among other things:

basis, which implied an overall approximate per share merger consideration range of $12.50 to $12.61).

Additionally, the overview in the July 31, 2017 supplemental preliminary discussion materials regarding the indication of interest received by

management business, financial forecasts and estimates relating to NewStar’s asset management business prepared by the

Houlihan Lokey’s opinion was directed to the board (in its capacity as such) and only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of common stock of the merger consideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the merger agreement in connection with
the transaction and did not address any other aspect or implication of the transaction or any portion or aspect of the transaction, any related
transaction or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection therewith or otherwise. The summary of
Houlihan Lokey’s opinion in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of its written opinion, which is attached
as Annex D to this proxy statement and describes the procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken and other matters considered by Houlihan Lokey in connection with the preparation of its opinion. However, neither Houlihan
Lokey’s opinion nor the summary of its opinion and the related analyses set forth in this proxy statement are intended to be, and do not
constitute, advice or a recommendation to the board, any security holder of NewStar or any other person as to how to act or vote with respect
to any matter relating to the transaction or any portion or aspect of the transaction or otherwise.

In connection with its opinion, Houlihan Lokey made such reviews, analyses and inquiries as it deemed necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances. Among other things, Houlihan Lokey:
 

 1. reviewed a draft, dated October 15, 2017, of the merger agreement and a draft, dated October 15, 2017, of the asset purchase agreement;

Houlihan Lokey deemed to be relevant; and
 

 
7. conducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other information and factors as Houlihan Lokey deemed

appropriate.

Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all data, material and other information
furnished, or otherwise made available, to it, discussed with or reviewed by it, or publicly available, and did not assume any responsibility with respect
to such data, material and other information. In addition, Houlihan Lokey was advised, and Houlihan Lokey assumed, that (i) the projections were
reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of management of NewStar as to the future
financial results and condition of NewStar and (ii) the CVR estimates were reasonably prepared in good faith on basis reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of management of NewStar as to the probability, timing and amounts of the contingent payments to be paid pursuant
to the contingent value rights. Houlihan Lokey assumed that the projections and the CVR estimates provided a reasonable basis on which to evaluate
NewStar and the transaction and, with NewStar’s approval, used and relied upon the projections and the CVR estimates for purposes of its analyses and
opinion. Houlihan Lokey expressed no view or opinion with respect to the projections, the CVR estimates or the respective assumptions on which they
were based. Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that there had been no change in the business, assets, liabilities,
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of NewStar since the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other
information, financial or otherwise, provided to Houlihan Lokey that would be material to its analyses or opinion, and that there was no information or
any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by Houlihan Lokey incomplete or misleading. With NewStar’s consent, Houlihan Lokey
assumed that any adjustments to the purchase price (as defined in the asset purchase agreement) for the purchased assets (as defined in the asset
purchase agreement) pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, merger agreement or otherwise would not be material to its analyses or opinion.

Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (a) the representations and warranties of all parties to the asset
purchase agreement, the merger agreement and all other related documents and instruments referred to in the asset purchase agreement or the merger
agreement were true and correct, (b) each party to the asset purchase agreement, the merger agreement and such other related documents and
instruments would fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by such party, (c) all conditions to the
consummation of the transaction would be satisfied without waiver thereof, and (d) the transaction would be consummated in a timely manner in
accordance with the terms described in the asset purchase agreement, the merger agreement and such other related documents and instruments, without
any amendments or modifications thereto. Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (i) the transaction would be
consummated in a manner that complies in all respects with all applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations, and (ii) all governmental,
regulatory, and other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the transaction would be obtained and that no delay, limitations,
restrictions or conditions would be imposed or amendments, modifications or waivers made that would have an effect on the transaction or NewStar that
would be material to its analyses or opinion. In addition, Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that the final forms
of the asset purchase agreement and the merger agreement would not differ in any respect from the drafts of the asset purchase agreement and the
merger agreement identified above.

Furthermore, in connection with its opinion, Houlihan Lokey was not requested to, and did not, make any physical inspection or independent appraisal
of any of the assets, properties or liabilities (fixed, contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of NewStar or any other party, including,
without limitation, the loans being transferred in the asset sale, nor was Houlihan Lokey provided with any such appraisal in connection with its opinion.
Houlihan Lokey did not make an independent evaluation of the adequacy of NewStar’s allowances for loan or credit losses, nor did Houlihan Lokey
review any individual loan files, credit memos or assigned asset

values. NewStar advised Houlihan Lokey that, in the absence of the transaction, NewStar was not contemplating sales of assets that would generate
losses that could be used to offset past or future taxes payable on its income and, at NewStar’s direction, for purposes of its analyses and opinion,
Houlihan Lokey assumed that such potential losses would not be realized or utilized by NewStar on a standalone basis and, consequently, had no current
value to NewStar. Houlihan Lokey did not estimate, and expressed no opinion regarding, the liquidation value of any entity or business. Houlihan Lokey
did not undertake any independent analysis of any potential or actual litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other contingent
liabilities, to which NewStar was or may have been a party or was or may have been subject, or of any governmental investigation of any possible
unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities to which NewStar was or may have been a party or was or may have been subject. Houlihan Lokey
noted that, for purposes of its opinion, Houlihan Lokey did not rely upon a review of the publicly available financial terms of other transactions because
Houlihan Lokey did not identify a sufficient number of relevant transactions in which Houlihan Lokey deemed the acquired companies to be sufficiently
similar to NewStar.

In connection with the rendering of its opinion, Houlihan Lokey was not requested to, and did not, (a) initiate or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, or solicit any indications of interest from, third parties with respect to the transaction or any portion or aspect of the transaction, the
securities, assets, business or operations of NewStar or any other party, or any alternatives to the transaction or any portion or aspect of the transaction,
(b) negotiate the terms of the transaction or any portion or aspect of the transaction, (c) assist NewStar in structuring the transaction or any portion or
aspect of the transaction, or (d) advise the board, NewStar or any other party with respect to alternatives to the transaction or any portion or aspect of the
transaction.

Houlihan Lokey’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available
to Houlihan Lokey as of, the date of its opinion. Houlihan Lokey did not undertake, and was under no obligation, to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw
its opinion, or otherwise comment on or consider events occurring or coming to its attention after the date of its opinion, including potential changes in
U.S. trade and tax laws, regulations and government policies and the enforcement thereof as were or could be proposed by parts of the federal
government. Houlihan Lokey did not express any opinion as to the price or range of prices at which common stock could be purchased or sold, or
otherwise be transferable, at any time.

Houlihan Lokey’s opinion was furnished for the use of the board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the transaction and may not
be used for any other purpose without its prior written consent. Under the terms of Houlihan Lokey’s engagement by NewStar, NewStar agreed that
Houlihan Lokey was acting as an independent contractor and that Houlihan Lokey was not acting as an agent or fiduciary of NewStar, the security
holders or creditors of NewStar or any other person or entity in connection with its engagement. Houlihan Lokey’s opinion was not intended to be, and
did not constitute, a recommendation to the board, NewStar, any security holder or any other party as to how to act or vote with respect to any matter
relating to the transaction, any portion or aspect of the transaction or otherwise.

Houlihan Lokey’s opinion only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock other than the Excluded
Stockholders of the merger consideration to be received by such holders (other than the excluded stockholders) pursuant to the merger agreement in
connection with the transaction and did not address any other aspect or implication of the transaction or any portion or aspect of the transaction, any
related transaction or any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection therewith or otherwise. Houlihan Lokey was not
requested to opine as to, and its opinion did not express an opinion as to or otherwise address, among other things: (i) the underlying business decision
of the board, NewStar, its security holders or any other party to proceed with or effect the transaction or any portion or aspect of the transaction, (ii) the
terms of any arrangements, understandings, agreements or documents related to, or the form, structure or any other portion or aspect of, the transaction,
including the form and structure of the merger consideration, or otherwise (other than the merger consideration to the extent expressly specified in the
opinion), (iii) the fairness of any portion or aspect of the transaction to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
NewStar, or to any other party, except if and only to the extent expressly set forth in the last sentence of the

opinion, (iv) the fairness of any portion or aspect of the transaction taken separately and not as a single, unitary transaction, including, without
limitation, the fairness of the purchase price for the purchased assets to be received by NewStar in the asset sale or the fairness of the merger
consideration to be received by the holders of common stock in the merger taken separately and not as part of a single, unitary transaction, (v) the
relative merits of the transaction or any portion or aspect of the transaction, as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might
have been available for NewStar or any other party, (vi) the fairness of any portion or aspect of the transaction to any one class or group of NewStar’s or
any other party’s security holders or other constituents vis-à-vis any other class or group of NewStar’s or such other party’s security holders or other
constituents (including, without limitation, the allocation of any consideration amongst or within such classes or groups of security holders or other
constituents), (vii) whether or not NewStar, the Asset Buyer, FE Holdco, First Eagle, Merger Sub, any of their respective security holders or any other
party was receiving or paying reasonably equivalent value in the transaction, or any portion of the transaction, (viii) the solvency, creditworthiness or
fair value of NewStar, the Asset Buyer, FE Holdco, First Eagle, Merger Sub or any other participant in the transaction, or any portion or aspect of the
transaction, or any of their respective assets, under any applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar matters, or
(ix) the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to or consideration payable to or received by any
officers, directors or employees of any party to the transaction, or any portion of the transaction, any class of such persons or any other party, relative to
the merger consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, Houlihan Lokey did not express any opinion, counsel or interpretation regarding matters that
require legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, tax or other similar professional advice. Houlihan Lokey assumed that such opinions, counsel or
interpretations had been or would be obtained from the appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, with the consent of the board, Houlihan Lokey
relied on the assessments by the board, NewStar and its advisors, as to all legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance and tax matters with respect to
NewStar, the transaction, any portion or aspect of the transaction, or otherwise.

In preparing its opinion to the board, Houlihan Lokey performed a variety of analyses, including those described below. The summary of Houlihan
Lokey’s analyses is not a complete description of the analyses underlying Houlihan Lokey’s opinion. The preparation of such an opinion is a complex
process involving various quantitative and qualitative judgments and determinations with respect to the financial, comparative and other analytical
methods employed and the adaptation and application of these methods to the unique facts and circumstances presented. As a consequence, neither
Houlihan Lokey’s opinion nor its underlying analyses is readily susceptible to summary description. Houlihan Lokey arrived at its opinion based on the
results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any individual analysis,
methodology or factor. While the results of each analysis were taken into account in reaching Houlihan Lokey’s overall conclusion with respect to
fairness, Houlihan Lokey did not make separate or quantifiable judgments regarding individual analyses. Accordingly, Houlihan Lokey believes that its
analyses and the following summary must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, methodologies and factors, without
considering all analyses, methodologies and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Houlihan Lokey’s
analyses and opinion.

In performing its analyses, Houlihan Lokey considered general business, economic, industry and market conditions, financial and otherwise, and other
matters as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its opinion. No company or business used in Houlihan Lokey’s analyses for
comparative purposes is identical to NewStar and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not entirely mathematical. As a consequence,
mathematical derivations (such as the high, low, mean and median) of financial data are not by themselves meaningful and in selecting the ranges of
multiples Houlihan Lokey applied its experience and judgment. The estimates contained in the projections and the implied reference range values
indicated by Houlihan Lokey’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition, any analyses relating to the value of assets, businesses or securities
do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold, which may depend on a variety of factors,
many of which are beyond the

control of NewStar. Much of the information used in, and accordingly the results of, Houlihan Lokey’s analyses are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty.

Houlihan Lokey’s opinion was only one of many factors considered by the board in evaluating the transaction. Neither Houlihan Lokey’s opinion nor its
analyses were determinative of the merger consideration or of the views of the board with respect to the transaction or the merger consideration. The
type and amount of consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement in connection with the transaction were determined through negotiation
between NewStar and the other parties to the transaction, and the decision to enter into the asset purchase agreement and the merger agreement was
solely that of the board and the NewStar board of directors.

Financial Analyses

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Houlihan Lokey in connection with the preparation of its opinion and
reviewed with the board on October 16, 2017. The order of the analyses does not represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by
Houlihan Lokey. The analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the analyses, as well as the
methodologies underlying, and the assumptions, qualifications and limitations affecting, each analysis, could create a misleading or incomplete view of
Houlihan Lokey’s analyses.

For purposes of its analyses, Houlihan Lokey calculated an implied value reference range for the merger consideration based on the upfront per share
cash consideration of $11.44 per share and the implied value reference range of a contingent value right indicated by Houlihan Lokey’s financial
analysis. The CVR estimates prepared and provided by NewStar’s management and approved for Houlihan Lokey’s use by the board contemplated two
scenarios, the transaction closing on or prior to December 31, 2017 and the transaction closing after December 31, 2017 and on or prior to March 31,
2018. For purposes of its analyses of the first scenario, Houlihan Lokey considered two approaches: (a) applying discount rates ranging from 1.15% to
1.42% based on interpolated U.S. treasury rates to the projected payment of 30% of the net tax refund to be made promptly after receipt of such refund
by First Eagle as provided in the CVR estimates and a discount rate of 5% based on, among other things, the yield on NewStar’s outstanding senior
unsecured notes to the projected payment of the remainder of the net tax refund as provided in the CVR estimates and (b) applying discount rates based
on interpolated U.S. treasury rates to the projected payments as provided in the CVR estimates and assuming that funds held in escrow following
payment would accrue interest at the applicable discount rate. For purposes of the second scenario, Houlihan Lokey also considered two approaches:
(a) applying discount rates ranging from 1.39% to 1.42% based on interpolated U.S. treasury rates to the projected payment of 30% of the net tax refund
to be made promptly after receipt of such refund by First Eagle as provided in the CVR estimates and a discount rate of 5% based on, among other
things, the yield on NewStar’s outstanding senior unsecured notes to the projected payment of the remainder of the net tax refund as provided in the
CVR estimates and (b) applying discount rates based on interpolated U.S. treasury rates to the projected payments as provided in the CVR estimates and
assuming that funds held in escrow following payment would accrue interest at the applicable discount rate. Houlihan Lokey’s analysis indicated an
implied value reference range of $0.77 to $0.99 per contingent value right which, together with the upfront per share cash consideration, indicated an
implied value reference range for the merger consideration of $12.21 to $12.43 per share of common stock.

In addition, for purposes of its analyses, Houlihan Lokey reviewed a number of financial metrics, including net income, adjusted net income, book value
and, with respect to NewStar, adjusted book value. “Adjusted net income” generally refers to the amount of the relevant company’s net income for a
specified period, as adjusted for certain non-recurring items. We refer to NewStar’s “adjusted book value” as the book value of NewStar as of a specific
date, as adjusted to exclude the portion of NewStar’s 8.25% Subordinated Notes recorded in equity due to the issuance of warrants in connection
therewith.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, equity values used in the selected companies analysis described below were calculated using the closing price of
the common stock of the selected companies listed below as of October 13, 2017, the estimates of future financial performance of NewStar relied upon
for the financial analyses described below were based on the projections, and the estimates of the future financial performance of the selected companies
listed below were based on publicly available research analyst estimates for those companies.

Selected Companies Analysis. Houlihan Lokey reviewed certain financial data for selected companies with publicly traded equity securities that
Houlihan Lokey deemed relevant. The financial data reviewed included:
 

 •  equity value as a multiple of adjusted net income for the last twelve months, which we refer to as “LTM adjusted net income”;
 

 •  equity value as a multiple of estimated net income for the 2017 fiscal year, which we refer to as “FY 2017E adjusted net income”;
 

 •  equity value as a multiple of estimated net income for the 2018 fiscal year, which we refer to as “FY 2018E adjusted net income”; and
 

 •  equity value as a multiple of book value.

The selected companies and resulting, low, high, median and mean multiples were:
 

 •  Chesswood Group Limited
 

 •  CIT Group Inc.
 

 •  ECN Capital Corp.
 

 •  Element Fleet Management Corp.
 

 •  GATX Corporation
 

 •  Marlin Business Services Corp.
 

 •  PacWest Bancorp
 

   Equity Value to  
   Adjusted Net Income    Book

Value     LTM    FY 2017E   FY 2018E   
Low    10.3x    10.8x    8.8x    0.88x 
High    25.1x    23.4x    17.9x    2.27x 
Median    13.8x    16.4x    14.5x    1.26x 
Mean    15.8x    16.1x    13.7x    1.38x 

Taking into account the results of the selected companies analysis, Houlihan Lokey applied selected multiple ranges of 13.0x to 16.0x to NewStar’s
LTM adjusted net income, 15.0x to 18.0x to NewStar’s FY 2017E adjusted net income, 13.0x to 16.0x to NewStar’s FY 2018E adjusted net income,
0.80x to 0.95x to NewStar’s book value and 0.80x to 0.95x to NewStar’s adjusted book value. The selected companies analysis indicated implied value
reference ranges per share of common stock of $8.50 to $10.45 based on the LTM adjusted net income multiple, $5.86 to $7.03 based on the FY 2017E
adjusted net income multiple, $9.09 to $11.18 based on the FY 2018E adjusted net income multiple, $12.40 to $14.25 based on the book value multiple
and $11.43 to $13.35 based on the adjusted book value multiple, as compared to the implied value reference range of the merger consideration of $12.21
to $12.43 per share of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement in connection with the transaction.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Houlihan Lokey performed a discounted cash flow analysis of NewStar based on the projections. Houlihan
Lokey applied a range of terminal value multiples of 13.0x to 16.0x to NewStar’s estimated net income per share for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2020 and discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 13.0%. The discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied value reference range per

share of common stock of $9.58 to $12.44, as compared to the implied value reference range of the merger consideration of $12.21 to $12.43 per share
of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement in connection with the transaction.

Other Matters

Houlihan Lokey was engaged by NewStar to act as its financial advisor in connection with the transaction and will receive fees for its services, a
substantial portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the transaction. The board engaged Houlihan Lokey based on Houlihan Lokey’s
experience and reputation. Houlihan Lokey is regularly engaged to provide financial advisory services in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
financings, and financial restructurings. Pursuant to its engagement by NewStar, an engagement fee of $100,000 became payable to Houlihan Lokey
upon its engagement, an opinion fee of $600,000 became payable to Houlihan Lokey upon the rendering of its opinion to the board with respect to the
proposed transaction and a transaction fee of $1,000,000, against which the engagement fee and the opinion fee are creditable to the extent previously
paid, will become payable to Houlihan Lokey upon the consummation of the transaction. In addition, pursuant to NewStar’s request, following the
execution of the asset purchase agreement and the merger agreement Houlihan Lokey began assisting NewStar in soliciting proposals from third parties
regarding a sale, merger, business combination or other similar transaction involving NewStar or a revised transaction with First Eagle and will become
entitled to an opinion fee to be mutually agreed upon the rendering of an opinion with respect to a transaction with a third party and a transaction fee of
$1,000,000 upon the consummation of any such transaction. NewStar has also agreed to reimburse Houlihan Lokey for certain expenses and to
indemnify Houlihan Lokey and certain related parties for certain potential liabilities and arising out of Houlihan Lokey’s engagement.

In the ordinary course of business, certain of Houlihan Lokey’s employees and affiliates, as well as investment funds in which they may have financial
interests or with which they may co-invest, may acquire, hold or sell, long or short positions, or trade, in debt, equity, and other securities and financial
instruments (including loans and other obligations) of, or investments in, NewStar, the Asset Buyer, FE Holdco, First Eagle or any other party that may
be involved in the transaction or any portion or aspect of the transaction and their respective affiliates or any currency or commodity that may be
involved in the transaction or any portion or aspect of the transaction. In addition, Houlihan Lokey understood that ORIX Corporation, a stockholder of
Houlihan Lokey, and/or one or more of its affiliates, is (i) a participant in a syndicated loan to First Eagle Investment Management, Inc., (ii) an investor
in an investment fund that is a member of the GSO Group (as defined below) and (iii) is a lender or a participant in syndicated loans to, and is a limited
partner of, one or more members of the Blackstone Group (as defined below).

As the board was aware, Houlihan Lokey and certain of its affiliates have in the past provided and are currently providing investment banking, financial
advisory and/or other financial or consulting services to NewStar, First Eagle Investment Management, Inc. or one or more security holders or affiliates
of, and/or portfolio companies of investment funds affiliated or associated with, First Eagle Investment Management, Inc. (which we refer to
collectively, with First Eagle Investment Management, Inc., as the “First Eagle Group”), and/or GSO, or one or more security holders or affiliates of,
and/or portfolio companies of investment funds affiliated or associated with, GSO (which we refer to collectively, with GSO, as the “GSO Group”),

companies of investment funds affiliated or associated with, Blackstone (which we refer to collectively, with Blackstone, as the “Blackstone Group”) for
which Houlihan Lokey and its affiliates have received, and may receive, compensation. Among other things Houlihan Lokey has (i) acted as financial
advisor to NewStar in connection with its sale of its equipment finance business, which transaction closed in December 2016 for which financial
advisory services to NewStar Houlihan Lokey received fees of approximately $1.2 million and (ii) (A) acted as financial advisor to Seneca Mortgage
Servicing LLC, which we refer to as “Seneca”, a member of the GSO Group, in connection with its sale of mortgage servicing rights, which transaction

Blackstone Group, in November 2015, and (F) acted as financial advisor to a creditor group, of which an affiliate of GSO was a member, in connection
with its interests as a creditor of Smile Brands Group, Inc., which representation was completed in November 2015 for which financial advisory services

Eagle, members of the First Eagle Group, the GSO Group, the Blackstone Group, other participants in the transaction or any portion or aspect of the
transaction or certain of their respective affiliates or security holders (including, without limitation, Corsair, which we refer to, together with security

NewStar, the Asset Buyer, FE Holdco, First Eagle, members of the First Eagle Group, the GSO Group, the Blackstone Group or the Corsair Group,
other participants in the transaction or any portion or aspect of the transaction or certain of their respective affiliates or security holders, for which advice
and services Houlihan Lokey and its affiliates have received and may receive compensation.

Certain NewStar Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

NewStar does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future earnings or other results given, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the
underlying assumptions and estimates. In connection with the proposed transaction, NewStar’s management prepared and provided selected unaudited
prospective financial information as summarized below.

The projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and the projections are included in this proxy statement because such information
was provided to certain parties in connection with the proposed transaction. Such information was reviewed by the board in its evaluation of the
proposed transaction and also provided to NewStar’s financial advisors, Credit Suisse and Houlihan Lokey. The same projections were provided to each
of Credit Suisse and Houlihan Lokey and such projections are referred to as the “forecasts” in the section “Opinion of Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
LLC” set forth above and are referred to as the “projections” in the section “Opinion of Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc.” set forth above. The projections
were approved by the board for Credit Suisse’s and Houlihan Lokey’s use and reliance in connection with their respective financial analyses and
opinions as described under “Opinions of NewStar’s Financial Advisors”. The projections were not prepared with a view to compliance with generally
accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States, which we refer to as “GAAP”, the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections
and forward-looking statements or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation
of prospective financial information. No reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in the projections to GAAP measures was created or used
during the sale process. Furthermore, neither KPMG LLP, our independent auditor, nor any other independent accountant has examined, reviewed,
compiled or otherwise applied procedures to the projections and, accordingly, assumes no responsibility for, and expresses no opinion on, them. The
projections included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, our management.

Although a summary of the projections is presented with numerical specificity, the projections reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future
events made by our management that our management believed were reasonable at the time the projections were prepared, taking into account the
relevant information available to management at the time. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as necessarily indicative
of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the projections not to be achieved include general economic conditions,
accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures and changes in tax laws. In addition, the
projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the merger or
the asset sale. Further, the projections do not take into account the potential consequences should the merger and asset sale fail to be consummated, and
should not be viewed in that context. As a result, there can be no assurance that the projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially
better or worse than those contained in the projections. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the board, our
management, our advisors or other representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the projections to be material
information of NewStar or predictive of actual future results nor should it be construed as financial guidance, and it should not be relied upon as such.

The summary of the projections is not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any stockholder to vote in favor of the merger proposal or the
asset sale proposal or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting or to influence any stockholder to make any investment decision
with respect to the merger and asset sale, including whether or not to seek appraisal rights with respect to our common stock. NewStar has made no
representation to First Eagle or the Asset Buyer, in the merger agreement, asset purchase agreement or otherwise, concerning the projections.

The projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information regarding NewStar contained
in our public filings with the SEC. The projections are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause our future results to
materially vary, see “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 20 of this proxy statement.

Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any responsibility, to update or otherwise
revise the projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date when NewStar prepared the projections or to reflect the occurrence of future events
or changes in general economic or industry conditions, even in the event that any of the assumptions underlying the projections are shown to be in error.
In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the projections, stockholders are cautioned not to rely on the projections included in this
proxy statement.

NewStar’s Current Expectations Regarding the Contingent Value Rights

As described in this proxy statement, each holder of a contingent value right will have the right to receive a pro-rata share of amounts attributable to
certain post-closing U.S. federal and state income tax refunds received by NewStar as a result of losses recognized upon the closing of the asset sale.
Under current law, these losses may be carried back to the two taxable years prior to, and interim period ending on, the closing date of the transactions.
NewStar currently expects the income tax refunds received to total approximately $41.6 million if the closing occurs in 2017 (which would result in
payments of approximately $1.00 in the aggregate for each contingent value right) or approximately $35.0 million if the closing occurs in the first
quarter of 2018 (which would result in payments of approximately $0.84 in the aggregate for each contingent value right). Such expectations differ from
the projections previously prepared by management (and summarized below in “Summary of Projections Provided to NewStar’s Financial Advisors
Regarding the Contingent Value Rights”) that were provided to NewStar’s financial advisors primarily due to management’s updated expectations that
NewStar’s full fiscal year 2017 earnings will be lower than management previously estimated and due to lower estimated state tax refunds as a result of
applicable state alternative minimum tax requirements.

Under the merger agreement, the holders of the contingent value rights will receive a payment of 30% of each tax refund (net of certain adjustments)
promptly after First Eagle receives such refund and 60% of the net tax refund will be disbursed upon approval by the JCT, with the remaining amount
disbursed upon the earlier of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and the completion by the IRS of any audit for the applicable tax year.

NewStar currently expects to be able to file for these refunds by the third quarter of 2018 and receive the tax refunds by the fourth quarter of 2018,
except that if the closing occurs in 2017, NewStar estimates that it can file the tax refund for NewStar’s estimated federal taxes paid in 2017 in the first
quarter of 2018 and receive such refund in the first quarter of 2018. These refund filings (other than with respect to the refund for NewStar’s estimated
federal taxes paid in 2017) can only be made after the purchase price for the asset sale is finally determined pursuant to certain post-closing adjustment
procedures and allocated for tax purposes among the purchased assets, as further described in “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase
Agreement—Asset Purchase Agreement—Payment of the Asset Sale Consideration” on page 114.

In addition, recently proposed tax legislation could adversely affect the availability of tax loss carrybacks—see “—Recent Developments Potentially
Affecting the Contingent Value Rights”, below.

The following table presents the current expectation of NewStar management as to the expected amount, and possible timing, of payments to the holders
of the contingent value rights. However, as such payments are subject to approvals by the IRS, JCT and other taxing authorities and current tax
law (which is subject to change), there can be no assurance that any payment will be made under the contingent value rights, or the amount or
timing of any such payment.

Summary of Projections Provided to NewStar’s Financial Advisors Regarding the Contingent Value Rights

In connection with the board’s evaluation of the proposed transaction prior to NewStar entering into the merger agreement and asset purchase
agreement, NewStar’s management prepared and provided prospective information regarding the timing of payments with respect to contingent value
rights. Such information was approved by the board for Credit Suisse’s and Houlihan Lokey’s use and reliance in connection with their respective
financial analyses and opinions. The same information was provided to each of Credit Suisse and Houlihan Lokey and such projections are referred to as
“tax information” in the section “Opinion of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC” set forth above and are referred to as “CVR estimates” in the section
“Opinion of Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc.” set forth above. A summary of these projections is included in this proxy statement in order to provide
stockholders additional information regarding the contingent value rights and information in respect thereof made available to the board and NewStar’s
financial advisors.

The timing of JCT approval and completion of IRS audits is not necessarily predictable, so the contingent value rights were analyzed by Credit Suisse
and Houlihan Lokey assuming, per NewStar management, payments of the remaining funds were made to holders of the contingent value rights nine
months, 18 months and three years after the tax refund filings are expected to be made in the third quarter of 2018.

Numbers in tables reflect rounding to nearest hundred thousand.

Although a summary of the information set forth in all of the tables above are presented with numerical specificity, the projections reflect numerous
assumptions and estimates as to future events made by our management that our management believed were reasonable at the time the projections were
prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to management at the time. However, this information is not fact and should not be
relied upon as necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the projections not to be achieved
include disputes with the IRS or other taxing authorities regarding the refunds, the possibility that the JCT will not approve such refunds and changes in
tax laws.

Recent Developments Potentially Affecting the Contingent Value Rights

On November 2, 2017 and November 9, 2017, respectively, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Committee on Finance each
introduced the Tax Bill. The Tax Bill, if enacted under either version, would eliminate the ability to carryback NOLs arising in tax years beginning after
2017, subject to limited exceptions not relevant to the contingent value rights. As a result, if the Tax Bill were enacted under either version and the
transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement were to close in 2018, NewStar would not be able to carryback the losses generated in
connection with the closing of the asset sale, and as such, holders of the contingent value rights would not be entitled to any payments thereunder. On
November 16, 2017, the Tax Bill proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee passed in the U.S. House of Representatives, but the Tax Bill
proposed by the Senate Committee on Finance has not yet been voted upon by the full U.S. Senate. If the Senate version is passed by the full U.S.
Senate, both versions of the Tax Bill will go to a joint congressional conference for reconciliation before an agreed-upon version goes back to both the
U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate for a final vote. There is substantial uncertainty as to whether either version of the Tax Bill will be
enacted or, if enacted, whether the final legislation will limit the carryback of NOLs to the same extent, if at all. Accordingly, holders are urged to
consult their tax advisors regarding this issue.

Financing of the Transactions

First Eagle’s obligations under the merger agreement are not subject to any financing condition. First Eagle will use the proceeds from the asset sale, and
other cash available to NewStar at closing, to pay a portion of the upfront merger consideration, with any remaining amount required to make such
payments to be funded by First Eagle with its available cash on hand or borrowings under its existing credit facilities.

Table of Contents

In addition, while the Asset Buyer’s obligations under the asset purchase agreement are not subject to any financing condition, concurrently with the
signing of the asset purchase agreement:
 

 
•  a wholly owned subsidiary of the Asset Buyer entered into a debt commitment letter with Wells Fargo providing for acquisition financing

under a secured revolving credit facility of up to $1.6 billion and a debt commitment letter with CDPQ providing for acquisition financing of
a term loan of at least $225 million; and

 

 
•  the Asset Buyer entered into an equity commitment letter with the GSO Fund, a newly-created investment fund managed by GSO, providing

for equity financing of up to $850 million.

The GSO Fund

The GSO Fund was formed for the purpose of the asset sale and it has obtained commitments from its limited partners of $850 million for the closing of
the asset sale to pay the purchase price. The general partner of the GSO Fund has assigned to NewStar the right to issue capital contribution notices to
the limited partners of the GSO Fund (and of any feeder fund thereof) and to seek to cause such limited partners to contribute capital to the GSO Fund
(and any feeder fund thereof) in accordance with the terms of the limited partnership agreement of the GSO Fund (and any feeder fund thereof).
NewStar may only exercise such rights if:
 

 

•  the general partner of the GSO Fund (and any feeder funds thereof) has not delivered capital contribution notices to each of the limited
partners by the date that is the eleventh calendar day prior to the anticipated closing date, which notices must provide for the capital
contributions to be made within ten calendar days and that if funded would, together with the proceeds of the debt financing and the
termination fee deposit, be sufficient for the Asset Buyer to have the funds required to close the asset sale;

 

 

•  such capital contribution notices have been delivered to the limited partners but one or more limited partners has failed to fund the entire
amount set forth in its respective notice when required, subject to the Asset Buyer’s closing conditions under the asset purchase agreement
have been satisfied (or in the case of conditions that by their nature are only to be satisfied at the closing, would be satisfied if the closing
were to occur on the anticipated closing date); or

 

 •  the closing has not occurred and:
 

 
•  the Asset Buyer’s closing conditions under the asset purchase agreement have been satisfied (other than those conditions that, by

their nature, are to be satisfied at the closing (but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions at the closing) at the time when the
closing is required to occur pursuant to the asset purchase agreement;

 

 •  the debt financing has been funded or will be funded at the closing on the terms set forth in the debt commitment letters; and
 

 
•  NewStar has confirmed to the Asset Buyer that if specific performance is granted, then NewStar is ready, willing and able to

consummate the closing on a timely basis and will take such actions required of it to effect the closing.

Equity Financing

Funding of the equity financing from the GSO Fund is subject to the conditions provided in the equity commitment letter, which include:
 

 
•  the Asset Buyer’s closing conditions under the asset purchase agreement are satisfied, other than those conditions that by their nature are to

be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the prior or substantially concurrent satisfaction of such conditions;
 

 
•  the substantially simultaneous funding of (A) the debt financing (or any alternate financing that has been obtained) and (B) the equity

contribution by the limited partners of the GSO Fund (and any feeder

 funds thereof) in an amount that (together with the funds in the deposit account) is sufficient to fund the purchase price; and
 

 •  the substantially simultaneous closing of the asset sale.
 

 
•  The GSO Fund will not be permitted to assert a failure of the condition in the bullet immediately above if the GSO Fund’s failure to

fund its equity commitment shall have been the cause of the failure of the closing.

The obligations of GSO Fund to fund the equity financing will terminate automatically and immediately upon the earliest to occur of:
 

 •  the closing of the asset sale; and
 

 •  the termination of the asset purchase agreement.

NewStar is party to the equity commitment letter for the purpose of enforcing the GSO Fund’s obligation to fund the equity commitment to Buyer.
NewStar is only permitted to enforce such obligations by specific performance against the Asset Buyer to the permitted under the asset purchase
agreement as further described below in “Asset Purchase Agreement—Specific Performance”.

Debt Financing

The commitment of each lender under its respective debt commitment letter expires upon the earliest to occur of:
 

 •  the termination of the asset purchase agreement without consummation of the asset sale;
 

 •  April 23, 2018, unless the lender, in its discretion, agrees to an extension;
 

 •  the consummation of the asset sale with or without the funding of the debt facilities;
 

 •  the date NewStar (or its affiliates) enters into a purchase agreement relating to the asset sale that is not GSO or an affiliate thereof; and
 

 •  the mutual agreement of the lender and Asset Buyer.

The definitive documentation governing the debt financing has not been finalized and, accordingly, the actual terms of the debt financing may differ
from those described in this document.

The Asset Buyer has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain the debt financing on the terms and conditions described in the debt commitment
letters. If any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable in the manner contemplated in the debt commitment letters, the Asset Buyer has agreed
to use its reasonable best efforts to arrange as promptly as practicable alternative debt financing on terms and conditions not materially less favorable to
NewStar than those contained in the debt commitment letters and in an amount, together with the available amounts under the other commitment letters,
that is sufficient to consummate the asset sale.

The availability of the debt facilities is subject, among other things, to:
 

 •  there not having been a material adverse effect;
 

 •  consummation of the asset sale prior to or substantially concurrently with the initial borrowing under the debt facility;
 

 
•  the equity financing contemplated by the equity commitment letter has been made, or substantially concurrently with the initial funding of

the debt facility will be made, in at least an amount equal to $360,000,000;
 

 •  payment of the lenders’ fees and expenses;

•  execution of definitive facilities documentation and delivery of certain closing documents (including, among others, a solvency certificate, a

borrowing base certificate and customary legal opinions);
 

 •  delivery of all “know your customer” and anti-money laundering documentation and other information; and
 

 •  the accuracy of certain representations and warranties.

As of the date hereof, no alternative financing arrangements or alternative financing plans have been made in the event that the debt financing described
herein is not available. Although the debt financing described above is not subject to a due diligence or “market out”, such financing may not be
considered assured.

Interests of NewStar’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions

Members of the board and our executive officers have various interests in the merger described in this section that may be different from, or in addition
to, the interests of our stockholders generally. You should keep this in mind when considering the recommendation of the board for the approval of the
merger proposal and the asset sale proposal. The members of the board were aware of these interests and considered them at the time they approved the
merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement and in making their recommendation that our stockholders approve the merger proposal and asset
sale proposal the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Treatment of Equity Awards

Under the merger agreement, the equity-based awards held by our directors and named executive officers will be treated as described in the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement—Merger Agreement—Treatment of Employee Stock Options and Restricted
Stock”.

The following table sets forth the cash proceeds that each of our non-employee directors and executive officers would receive at the closing of the
merger in respect of their outstanding restricted stock awards and stock options, in each case, based on the number of shares subject to each equity
award held as of November 8, 2017, the treatment of such equity awards pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and the merger consideration.
Accordingly, the table describes payments in respect of equity awards that may vest prior to the completion of the merger based upon the completion of
continued service and independent of the occurrence of the merger.

share expected to be received of (i) the upfront merger consideration of $11.44 per share and (ii) an assumed contingent value right payment of
$1.00 per share to be paid over time as outlined elsewhere in this proxy statement. This represents the maximum estimated payment under each
contingent value right and is based on an assumption that the transaction will close in 2017. If the transaction closes in 2018, the expected total
payments relating to shares of restricted stock, including payments of $0.84 per share relating to the contingent value rights, are estimated to be
$975,842 for Mr. Conway, $441,269 for Mr. Bray, $618,789 for each of Messrs. McAuliffe and du Four, $544,630 for Mr. McCready, $94,936 for
each of Messrs. Bralver and Cooper and, $126,594 for each of Messrs. Thornburgh, Noonan and Fallon and Ms. O’Hara.

(2) Dollar amounts in this column represent the total number of shares subject to outstanding options, whether vested or unvested, multiplied by the
aggregate cash consideration per share expected to be received as a result of the transaction, with an assumed contingent value right payment of
$1.00 per share as described in footnote (1) based on an assumption that the transaction will close in 2017, in each case, less the aggregate exercise
price of the related options. If the transaction closes in 2018, the expected total payments relating to stock options, including payments of $0.84
per share relating to the contingent value rights, are estimated to be $13,300 for each of Messrs. Noonan and Fallon and Ms. O’Hara, and $6,650
for Mr. Cooper, with total payments relating to both restricted stock and options of $139,894 for each of Messrs. Noonan and Fallon and
Ms. O’Hara, and $101,586 for Mr. Cooper.

(3) For Mr. Cooper, the dollar amount is determined based on the 5,000 options held by CZPM. Mr. Cooper is a stockholder of Capital Z GP and
CZPM and an officer and co-owner of CZPM. Mr. Cooper may be deemed to be part of a group along with CZPM, Capital Z III GP, Capital Z III
LP, and Capital Z III, and may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the securities held by such entities, although Mr. Cooper disclaims
beneficial ownership of such securities except to the extent of any indirect pecuniary interest therein (within the meaning of Rule 16a-1 of the
Securities Exchange Act) in an indeterminate portion of the securities beneficially owned by such entities.

Change in Control and Employment and Severance Arrangements

The Company has entered into an employment agreement with each of Timothy Conway, John Bray, Patrick McAuliffe, Mark du Four and Daniel
McCready (collectively, our “named executive officers”). The agreements specify the terms of employment for our named executive officers and
compensation due upon certain termination events, including termination of employment without cause, or resignation for good reason, within two years
from the date of a change in control of the Company (a “qualifying termination”). The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will qualify
as a change of control. A termination of employment by an executive officer would be for “good reason” if the officer experienced a reduction in base
salary from the base salary then in effect, or if he were relocated more than 20 miles from the Company’s principal place of business. For Messrs.
Conway and Bray, “good reason” would also include a material diminution of duties, which includes an assignment of duties inconsistent with or
significantly different from the duties, responsibilities and status as an officer and executive of a public company. Further for Mr. Conway, “good
reason” would also include any requirement to not report directly to the Board of Directors, or a materially adverse change in incentive plan structure or
terms. For each named executive officer, these severance benefits are estimated and quantified in the table below and generally include the following:
the payment of two times the named executive officer’s base salary; a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination (pro-rated through the termination date
based on the target bonus for the year); an amount equal to two times the executive’s target incentive bonus in respect of the year in which the
termination occurs; the continuation of health benefits for a two-year period following termination; and accelerated vesting of equity awards.

Golden Parachute Compensation

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below presents the estimated amounts of compensation that each named executive officer
could receive that are based on or otherwise relate to the merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable
SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the merger-related compensation payable to NewStar’s named

executive officers. This merger-related compensation is subject to a non-binding advisory vote of NewStar’s stockholders, as set forth in Proposal 3 to
this proxy statement.

The amounts set forth in the table below have been calculated assuming, solely for purposes of this golden parachute disclosure, that the merger is
consummated on December 31, 2017; where applicable, the upfront merger consideration of $11.44 and a contingent value right that may provide up to
an additional $1.00 in payments; and that each named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination of employment as of December 31, 2017.
The amounts indicated below are estimates of amounts that would be payable to the named executive officers, and the estimates are based on multiple
assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions based on the timing of the closing of the transaction and other assumptions
described in this proxy statement. Some of the assumptions are based on information not currently available and, as a result the actual amounts, if any, to
be received by a named executive officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below. All dollar amounts set forth below have been
rounded to the nearest whole number.

(1) Amounts reflected in the above table under the “Cash” and “Perquisites/Benefits” columns are attributable to double-trigger arrangements (i.e., the

amounts are triggered by a qualifying termination of employment of the named executive officer within two years following a change of control)
and are payable under the applicable employment agreement. Amounts set forth under the “Equity” and “Other” columns are expected to become
payable in connection with the transactions without respect to whether there is a qualifying termination.

(2) For each named executive officer, amounts in this column consist of (i) a lump sum severance payment equal to two times his annual base salary
as of the date of the assumed termination, (ii) a lump sum payment equal to two times his target bonus for the current year and (iii) a lump sum
payment in an amount equal to a pro-rated portion of his target bonus for the current year, from the beginning of the year through the termination
date.

The following table breaks down the amounts in this column by type of payment:

Daniel McCready    750,000    1,600,000    800,000 

 
(3) For each named executive officer, amounts in this column reflect the aggregate dollar value of restricted stock awards for which vesting would be

accelerated under the merger agreement, based on the upfront merger consideration of $11.44 per share and an assumed $1.00 contingent value
payment, which assumes a closing of the transactions in 2017. If the transaction closes in 2018, the expected total value of payments, including
payments of $0.84 per share relating to the contingent value rights, are estimated to instead be $975,842 for Mr. Conway, $441,269 for Mr. Bray,
$618,789 for each of Messrs. McAuliffe and du Four, and $544,630 for Mr. McCready.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of common stock.
This discussion applies only to U.S. holders that hold common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which we refer as the “Code”, and that exchange shares of such common stock in the merger in return for cash and contingent
value rights. This discussion does not address the consequences of the merger to holders who receive cash pursuant to the exercise of appraisal rights.
This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light of the U.S. holder’s particular circumstances
or to U.S. holders subject to special rules, such as:
 

 •  dealers in securities;
 

 •  traders subject to a mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to common stock;
 

 
•  persons holding common stock as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, conversion transaction, integrated transaction or constructive sale

transaction;
 

 •  persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
 

 •  partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 •  persons who acquired common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation;
 

 •  certain financial institutions;
 

 •  regulated investment companies;
 

 •  real estate investment trusts;
 

 •  insurance companies;
 

 •  persons who own or are deemed to own 10% or more of shares of common stock;
 

 •  tax-exempt entities, including an “individual retirement account” or “Roth IRA”; or
 

 •  persons who are not U.S. holders.

Table of Contents

If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a
partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding common stock and partners in such
partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to them.

This discussion is based on the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final and temporary Treasury regulations, all as of the date
hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, and to differing interpretations. This discussion is for general information
only and should not be construed as tax advice or a substitute for careful tax planning. It is a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive
analysis or description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. Tax considerations under state, local and foreign laws and
alternative minimum tax considerations are not addressed.

For purposes of this discussion, we refer to the term “U.S. holder” as a beneficial owner of common stock that is:
 

 •  a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
 

 
•  a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the

United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 
•  a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration, and one or more U.S.

persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) such trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or

 

 •  an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.

Tax Consequences of the Merger Generally

The exchange of common stock for cash and contingent value rights in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The amount of gain or loss a U.S. holder recognizes, and the timing and potentially the character of a portion of such gain or loss, depends on the U.S.
federal income tax treatment of the contingent value right, with respect to which there is substantial uncertainty.

The merger consideration consists of cash and contingent value rights; consequently, the receipt of the merger consideration may be treated as either a
“closed transaction” or an “open transaction” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The installment method of reporting any gain attributable to the
receipt of a contingent value right will not be available because the common stock is traded on an established securities market. The following sections
discuss the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the receipt of the merger consideration in the event it is treated as an open transaction and,
alternatively, in the event it is treated as a closed transaction. There is no authority directly addressing whether contingent payment rights with
characteristics similar to the rights under a contingent value right should be treated as “open transactions” or “closed transactions”, and such question is
inherently factual in nature. Accordingly, holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding this issue. The contingent value rights also may be
treated as debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, as such treatment is unlikely, the discussion below does not address the tax
consequences of such a characterization. We urge you to consult your tax advisor with respect to the proper characterization of the receipt of a
contingent value right.

Receipt of the Contingent Value Rights

Treatment as Closed Transaction

If the value of the contingent value rights can be “reasonably ascertained”, the transaction should generally be treated as a “closed transaction” for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, in which event a U.S. holder should generally recognize capital gain (or loss) for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon
consummation of the merger

equal to the positive (or negative) difference between (x) the sum of (i) the fair market value of the contingent value rights received and (ii) the amount
of cash received, and (y) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered pursuant the merger.

If the transaction is “closed” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder’s initial tax basis in the contingent value rights will equal the fair
market value of the contingent value rights on the date of the consummation of the merger. The holding period of the contingent value rights will begin
on the day following the date of the consummation of the merger.

Treatment as Open Transaction

The receipt of the contingent value rights would generally be treated as an “open transaction” if the value of the contingent value rights cannot be
“reasonably ascertained”. If the receipt of the merger consideration is treated as an “open transaction” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S.
holder would first recover its adjusted tax basis in the common stock surrendered pursuant to the merger and then should generally recognize (i) capital
gain, if any, for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon consummation of the merger if and to the extent the amount of cash received exceeds such U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the merger or (ii) capital loss, if any, only after all payments in respect the
contingent value rights have been received or it is determined that no further payments in respect of the contingent value rights can be received. Gain or
loss recognized in the transaction must be determined separately for each identifiable block of common stock surrendered pursuant to the merger (i.e.,
shares of common stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain or loss generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if
the holder’s holding period in the shares of common stock exceeds one year at the time of the completion of the merger. Long-term capital gains of
non-corporate U.S. holders generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations. Capital gains recognized by individuals, trusts and estates also may be subject to a 3.8% federal Medicare contribution tax. Subject to the
Section 483 rules discussed below under “Payments Under the Contingent Value Rights”, if the transaction is “open” for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the contingent value rights would not be taken into account in determining the holder’s taxable gain upon receipt of the merger consideration
and a U.S. holder would take no tax basis in the contingent value rights, but would generally recognize capital gain as payments with respect to the
contingent value rights are made or deemed made in accordance with the U.S. holder’s regular method of accounting, but only to the extent the sum of
such payments (and all previous payments under the contingent value rights), together with the amount received upon consummation of the merger
discussed above, exceeds such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered pursuant the merger.

It is the position of the IRS, as reflected in Treasury Regulations, that only in “rare and extraordinary cases” is the value of property so uncertain as to
warrant “open transaction” treatment.

Payments Under the Contingent Value Rights

Treatment as Closed Transaction

There is no authority directly on point with respect to the treatment of payments similar to those under the contingent value right. You should therefore
consult your tax advisor as to the taxation of such payments. Under characterization as a “closed transaction”, a payment with respect to each contingent
value right would likely be treated as a non-taxable return of a U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the contingent value right to the extent thereof. A
payment in excess of such amount may be treated as either (i) payment with respect to a sale of a capital asset, (ii) income taxed at ordinary rates, or
(iii) dividends. Additionally, it is possible that, were a payment to be treated as being with respect to the sale of a capital asset, a portion of such payment
would constitute imputed interest under Section 483 of the Code (as described directly above under “Treatment as Open Transaction”).

Table of Contents

Treatment as Open Transaction

If the transaction is treated as an “open transaction”, a payment in the future to a U.S. holder of a contingent value right should be treated as a payment
under a contract for the sale or exchange of shares of common stock to which Section 483 of the Code applies. Under Section 483 of the Code, a portion
of a payment made pursuant to the contingent value right more than one year after the date of the exchange of the shares of common stock for the
merger consideration will be treated as interest, which will be ordinary income to the U.S. holder of the contingent value right. The interest amount will
equal the excess of the amount received over its present value at the consummation of the merger, calculated using the applicable federal rate as the
discount rate and using such U.S. holder’s regular method of accounting (such amount being taken into account when paid, in the case of a cash method
holder, and, when fixed, in the case of an accrual method holder). The portion of the payment pursuant to the contingent value right that is not treated as
interest under Section 483 of the Code should be treated as gain from the sale of a capital asset (or as recovery of the adjusted tax basis in shares of
common stock), as discussed above.

Due to the legal and factual uncertainty regarding the valuation and tax treatment of the contingent value right, you are urged to consult your tax advisor
concerning the tax consequences resulting from the receipt of the contingent value right in the merger.

Backup Withholding

Payments made in exchange for shares of common stock generally will be subject to information reporting unless the holder is an “exempt recipient”
and may also be subject to backup withholding currently at a rate of 28%. To avoid backup withholding, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an
exemption should complete and return IRS Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided is
correct and such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding.

Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income
tax liability, provided the relevant information is timely furnished to the IRS.

You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to your particular circumstances as well as any
tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or under any state, local or foreign tax laws.

Regulatory Approvals

Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until notifications have been given and
information furnished to the Antitrust Division and the FTC and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. On October 30, 2017,
BCP CC Holdings, L.P., which is the “ultimate parent entity” of First Eagle under the HSR Act and rules thereunder, NewStar and the Asset Buyer filed
their respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC, and the Antitrust Division and the FTC granted early
termination of the applicable waiting period on November 21, 2017.

statement and in “The Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement—Asset Purchase Agreement—Expenses” on page 123 of this proxy
statement, the merger agreement and asset purchase agreement each provide that each party will pay all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection
with the the merger and asset sale.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger

NewStar, as the surviving corporation in the merger, will account for the merger as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting
for financial accounting purposes, whereby the estimated purchase price will be allocated to the assets and liabilities of NewStar based on their fair
values following FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations.

Merger Agreement

Structure of the Merger

At the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into NewStar, with NewStar surviving the merger as an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of First Eagle.

Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws

At the effective time of the merger, the certificate of incorporation of NewStar will be amended, as set forth in Exhibit A of the merger agreement, and,
as so amended, will be the certificate of incorporation of NewStar until amended in accordance with applicable law. At the effective time of the merger,
and without any further action on the part of NewStar and Merger Sub, the bylaws of NewStar will be amended, as set forth in Exhibit B of the merger
agreement, and, as so amended, will be the bylaws of NewStar until amended in accordance with applicable law.

Directors and Officers

At the effective time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, (a) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time
will be the directors of NewStar and (b) the officers of NewStar immediately prior to the effective time will be the officers of NewStar.

When the Merger Becomes Effective

Unless First Eagle and NewStar agree on another date, the closing of the merger will take place on the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted by applicable law) of the closing conditions (other than those conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing,
but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions at the closing) set forth in the merger agreement.

At the closing, First Eagle and NewStar will file with the Delaware Secretary of State a certificate of merger and make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL in connection with the merger. The merger will become effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State, or at such later time as First Eagle and NewStar may agree and as is set forth in the certificate of merger.

Effect of the Merger on NewStar’s Common Stock

At the effective time of the merger, each share of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than cancelled
shares and dissenting shares, each as described below) will be converted automatically into the right to receive (i) the upfront per share consideration
and (ii) one contingent value right.

All shares of common stock owned by NewStar (including treasury shares) or owned by First Eagle, FE Holdco or Merger Sub (other than shares in
trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity for the benefit of customers or clients), which we refer
to as the “cancelled shares”, will be cancelled and retired and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

Shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and which are held by holders who have not voted in
favor of or consented to the merger and who are entitled to demand, and have properly demanded, their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such
shares of common stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, which we refer to as the “dissenting shares”, will not be cancelled or converted
into the right to receive the merger consideration.

If any holder of dissenting shares loses such holder’s rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder’s dissenting shares will be deemed to have
been each cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger

consideration. At the effective time of the merger, any holder of dissenting shares will cease to have any rights, except the rights provided in Section 262
of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. For more information regarding dissenters’ rights, see the section entitled “Rights of Appraisal”
beginning on page 139 of this proxy statement.

Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, will be converted into and become one
share of common stock of NewStar, as the surviving company in the merger, and will constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of NewStar.

Treatment of Employee Stock Options and Restricted Stock

At the effective time of the merger, each option granted by NewStar to purchase shares of NewStar common stock under its 2006 Incentive Plan,
whether or not vested, which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time, will, without any action on the part of First Eagle,
FE Holdco, Merger Sub, NewStar or the holder, be cancelled, and in consideration for such cancelled option, the holder thereof will be entitled to
receive (less applicable withholding taxes) (i) a cash payment equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of (A) the upfront per share consideration
over (B) the exercise price per share of common stock subject to such option multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of common stock subject to
such option, which payment will be made by NewStar no later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date of NewStar following the effective time
and (ii) one contingent value right for each share of common stock subject to such option.

At the effective time of the merger, each share of restricted stock will, without any action on the part of First Eagle, FE Holdco, Merger Sub, NewStar or
the holder, be cancelled and the holder will be entitled to receive in consideration for each such cancelled share (less applicable withholding taxes): (i) a
cash payment equal to the upfront per share consideration, no later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date of NewStar following the effective
time and (ii) one contingent value right.

Treatment of Warrants

As of the effective time of the merger, each outstanding NewStar warrant to purchase shares of common stock will become exercisable solely for the
merger consideration in accordance with the terms of such warrant and continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in
the applicable warrant in effect immediately prior to the merger.

Contingent Value Rights

Each holder of a contingent value right will have the right to receive the payments set forth below. The contingent value rights will not represent any
equity or ownership interest in NewStar, First Eagle, FE Holdco, Merger Sub or any affiliate thereof, in any constituent company to the merger, or in any
other person and will not be represented by any certificates or other instruments. The contingent value rights will not have any voting or dividend rights,
and except as set forth below, no interest will accrue on any amounts payable on the contingent value rights to any holder thereof.

The contingent value rights may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered in any manner, other than transfers by will or intestacy, by
inter vivos or testamentary trust where the contingent value right is to be passed to the beneficiaries upon the death of the trustee, pursuant to a court
order, by operation of law, or in connection with the dissolution, liquidation or termination of a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or
other entity which is the holder thereof.

Prior to the effective time of the merger, First Eagle will designate an agent, which may be the same person as the paying agent (as described in the
section below), that is reasonably acceptable to NewStar, to hold the net tax refunds in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, which we
refer to as the “CVR Agent”.

Table of Contents

As a result of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement, NewStar anticipates that it will recognize a loss for U.S.
federal and state income tax purposes, which we refer to as the “asset purchase loss”.

Following the closing of the merger, at the direction of the CVR Committee, First Eagle and NewStar will use reasonable best efforts to obtain U.S.
federal and state income tax refunds for the two taxable years prior to, and interim period ending on, the closing date as a result of the asset purchase
loss.

In addition, the CVR Committee will prepare the tax returns to claim such refund, which we refer to each as a “refund return”, subject to First Eagle’s
approval. First Eagle will timely file any such refund return within ten business days after any such refund return has been so approved.
 

 
•  Prior to any such filing, the CVR Committee, First Eagle and NewStar will cooperate in good faith to resolve any disputes with respect to

any such refund returns.
 

 
•  In the event they are unable to resolve any such objections within 15 days, an accounting firm will be engaged to resolve such objections

within 15 days following its engagement, which resolution will be final and binding.

Following NewStar’s receipt of any U.S. federal and state income tax refunds described above, NewStar will promptly (within five business days)
deposit with the CVR Agent the net tax refund amount. The CVR Agent will promptly deposit with the paying agent (and the paying agent will
promptly disburse to the holders of contingent value rights) an amount equal to 30% of such net tax refund. At the time of such distribution, each
contingent value right will entitle the holder to a payment equal to the quotient of:
 

 •  the product of (i) 30% multiplied by (ii) the amount of the applicable net tax refund divided by
 

 
•  the number of contingent value rights then outstanding (which will be deemed to include such number of contingent value rights that would

have been issued to stockholders who have properly demanded their statutory rights of appraisal under applicable Delaware law or who have
not properly exchanged their shares for payment of the merger consideration).

The remainder of such net tax refund will be held by the CVR Agent in the tax holdback account. Any interest earned on the funds in the tax holdback
account will be for the benefit of, and any losses will be for the account of, the holders of contingent value rights.

In the event any U.S. federal income tax refund described in this section is approved by the JCT prior to completion of the IRS audit, the CVR Agent
will promptly deposit with the paying agent (and the paying agent will promptly disburse to the holders of contingent value rights) an amount equal to
the applicable JCT approval payment. At the time of such distribution, each contingent value right will entitle the holder to a payment equal to the
quotient of:
 

 •  the amount of the applicable JCT approval payment divided by
 

 •  the number of contingent value rights then outstanding (calculated in the manner as set forth above).

The first JCT approval payment will also include an amount equal to 60% of any net tax refund that is a “quick refund” of NewStar’s estimated
payments of U.S. federal income taxes for the taxable year that ends on the closing date (plus any interest earned to date on such amount in the tax
holdback account).

The remaining amount of any net tax refund (plus any interest earned to date on such amount) will be promptly deposited by the CVR Agent with the
paying agent (and the paying agent will promptly disburse to the holders of contingent value rights) such remaining refund payment upon the earlier of:
 

 
•  the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the IRS’s review of the tax return for the taxable year to which such net tax refund

relates; and

Table of Contents

 •  the time that the IRS closes its income tax audit of NewStar for the taxable year to which such net tax refund relates.

At the time of such distribution, each contingent value right will entitle the holder to a payment equal to the quotient of:
 

 •  the amount of the remaining refund payment divided by
 

 •  the number of contingent value rights then outstanding (calculated in the manner as set forth above).

In the event any net tax refund is reduced as a result of a “determination” (as described below), the CVR Agent will disburse to NewStar an amount
equal to the cash tax owed as a result of such reduction, which disbursement will reduce the amount held in the tax holdback account (but not below
zero) and may result in there being no further funds in the tax holdback account to be disbursed to the holders of contingent value rights.
 

 •  A “determination” means the final resolution of liability for any tax for any taxable period as a result of:
 

 
•  a final decision, judgment, decree or other order by any court of competent jurisdiction that can no longer be appealed to a court

other than the Supreme Court of the United States;
 

 
•  a final settlement with the IRS, a closing agreement or accepted offer in compromise under applicable provisions of federal tax law

(or a comparable agreement under the laws of other jurisdictions, which resolves the liability for the taxes addressed in such
agreement for any taxable period);

 

 
•  any allowance of a refund or credit in respect of an overpayment of tax, but only after the expiration of all periods during which such

refund or credit may be recovered by the jurisdiction imposing the tax; or
 

 •  any other final disposition, including by reason of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
 

 
•  Holders of contingent value rights will have no obligation to return or otherwise forfeit any amounts previously paid to such holders in the

event that, after any such payment, there is a determination that adversely affects any of the net tax refunds.

CVR Committee

Prior to the merger, NewStar will form the CVR Committee with authority to monitor compliance with the above provisions and enforce, on behalf of
the holders of contingent value rights, the obligations of First Eagle and NewStar pursuant to the provisions described in this section.
 

 
•  The member of the CVR Committee will have the authority to appoint any successor member to the CVR Committee reasonably acceptable

to First Eagle.
 

 
•  Prior to the closing, NewStar will designate an alternate individual reasonably acceptable to First Eagle to serve on the CVR Committee in

the event of the death or disability of the member of the CVR Committee or the resignation of such member without designation of a
successor.

The CVR Committee will have full authority on behalf of the holders of contingent value rights to enforce the provisions set forth above. Any decision,
act or instruction of the CVR Committee with respect to the matters set forth in the provisions described in this section will be final, binding and
conclusive on all holders of contingent value rights.

The reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the CVR Committee, including reasonable and documented fees for counsel and
accountants and reasonable compensation for service of the members of such committee will be paid by First Eagle, and First Eagle will indemnify each
person who is or was a member of the CVR Committee.

First Eagle and NewStar will use reasonable best efforts to:
 

 •  obtain the maximum amount of net tax refunds reasonably available and as reflected on the relevant refund return;
 

 
•  cooperate with audits, and challenge in good faith any determination by a taxing authority or court adversely affecting all or any portion of

such refunds where, after consultation with First Eagle, the CVR Committee has determined that such challenge has a reasonable possibility
of success; and

 

 
•  provide the CVR Committee and its counsel and accountants with reasonable access to the books and records of First Eagle and NewStar

relevant to the net tax refunds.

First Eagle and NewStar will keep the CVR committee informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of the foregoing. The CVR Committee will
have the opportunity to control any such audit, dispute or action, and none of First Eagle, NewStar or the CVR Committee, as applicable, will settle or
agree to settle any such audit, dispute or action without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

Any decision of the CVR Committee with respect to the matters set forth above will be binding on all holders of the contingent value rights; provided,
that the holders of at least 25% of the outstanding contingent value rights will be entitled to direct the CVR Committee to act on behalf of the holders of
the contingent value rights to enforce: (A) the preparation of the refund tax returns by the CVR Committee; (B) the filing of such tax returns by First
Eagle; and (C) the deposit by NewStar of the net tax refunds actually received with the CVR Agent. Furthermore, each holder of a contingent value right
is entitled to enforce the right to receive the payments set forth above to which such holder is entitled.

CVR Agent

The cash deposited with the CVR Agent pursuant to the provisions described in this section will be invested by the CVR Agent as directed by the CVR
Committee. If there are losses with respect to such investments that cause the tax holdback account to diminish below the level required to make cash
payments to the holders of contingent value rights as contemplated by the provisions described in this section, First Eagle will have no obligation to
replace or restore such portion of the funds in the tax holdback account. Nor will First Eagle have any obligation to replace or restore any interest or
other income from any investment of the net tax refunds in the tax holdback account. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment will
become a part of the tax holdback account.

The CVR Agent will keep a register, which we refer to as the “CVR register”, for the purpose of registering contingent value rights and any permitted
transfers of contingent rights.
 

 
•  Subject to the transfer restrictions described above, every request made to transfer a contingent value rights must be in writing and

accompanied by a written instrument of transfer, duly executed by the holder thereof (or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing,
personal representative or survivor) and setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances relating to the transfer.

 

 •  Upon receipt of such written notice, the CVR Agent will register the transfer of the contingent value rights in the CVR register.
 

 
•  First Eagle and the CVR Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other tax or governmental charge that is

imposed in connection with any such registration of transfer.

The holder of a contingent value right may at any time at its option abandon all of its remaining rights in a contingent value right by written notice to the
CVR Agent and First Eagle or by transfer of such contingent value right to First Eagle without consideration therefor. Nothing in the provisions
described in this section is intended to prohibit First Eagle from offering to acquire a contingent value right for consideration in its sole discretion.

Payment of the Merger Consideration

Prior to the effective time of the merger, First Eagle will designate a paying agent that is reasonably acceptable to NewStar, which we refer to as the
“paying agent”. At the closing, First Eagle will cause to be deposited (including by directing NewStar to deposit the proceeds paid to NewStar by the
Asset Buyer in connection with the closing of the asset sale), with the Paying Agent cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate upfront per share
consideration with respect to all shares of common stock (other than restricted stock, cancelled shares and dissenting shares), which we refer to as the
“upfront consideration payment fund”.

With respect to any dissenting shares, First Eagle will be required to deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the
aggregate upfront per share consideration payable in respect of such dissenting shares promptly following the holder thereof failing to perfect or
effectively withdrawing or losing its right to dissent under the DGCL.

The cash deposited with the Paying Agent will be invested by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by First Eagle. To the extent that there are losses
with respect to such investments, or the upfront consideration payment fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash
payment of the upfront per share consideration, First Eagle will promptly restore such lost funds so as to ensure that the upfront consideration payment
fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.

As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time, the Paying Agent will mail or otherwise provide to each former holder of record of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the effective time represented shares of common stock, if any, which we refer to as a “certificate”, and
each former holder of record of shares of common stock held in book-entry form, which we refer to as “book-entry shares”, in each case other than
holders of restricted stock, cancelled shares and dissenting shares, transmittal materials, including a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the certificates or book-entry shares, as applicable, in exchange for the merger consideration.

Upon proper surrender of a certificate or book-entry shares for exchange and cancellation to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such
transmittal materials and instructions, the holder of record of such certificate or book-entry shares (other than restricted stock, cancelled shares and
dissenting shares) will be entitled to receive the merger consideration in exchange therefor, and the certificate or book-entry share so surrendered will
immediately be cancelled.

the aggregate with all other events, developments, changes, effects or occurrences, has had or would reasonably be expected to have:
 

 
•  a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of NewStar and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (but

any of its representatives receives a bona fide written acquisition proposal that was not solicited in breach of the provisions described in this section,
including from an excluded party (whether received from an excluded party prior to, on or after the no-shop period start date), and the board has
determined in good faith (i) that such acquisition proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal (as summarized
below) and (ii) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then NewStar and its representatives may,
prior to receipt of the requisite stockholder approval:
 

 •  engage in discussions or negotiations with such person who has made such acquisition proposal (and its representatives); and
 

 
•  provide information (including non-public information) regarding, and afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records and

(10) business day period, at least one (1) business day prior to the special meeting);

We refer to any of the foregoing actions as a “change in recommendation”.

For purposes of the merger agreement:
 

 

•  “acquisition proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than a joint offer from First Eagle, FE Holdco, Merger
Sub and the Asset Buyer) with respect to (x) the acquisition of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible
into, such securities) representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (or of securities
representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the total voting power of NewStar) or (y) the acquisition of twenty percent (20%) or more of
the consolidated assets (including stock of NewStar’s subsidiaries) of NewStar and its subsidiaries.

 

 

•  “excluded party” means any person from whom NewStar or any of its representatives has received a written acquisition proposal after the
execution of the merger agreement and prior to the no-shop period start date, which written acquisition proposal the board has determined in
good faith prior to the start of the no-shop period start date is or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal. A person will
cease to be an excluded party if:

 

 
•  such acquisition proposal is withdrawn (with any amendment, modification or replacement of such acquisition proposal not, in and

of itself, be deemed a withdrawal of such acquisition proposal); or
 

 
•  such acquisition proposal, in the good faith determination of the board (after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial

advisor), no longer is or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal.
 

 

•  “superior proposal” means a bona fide written acquisition proposal (except all references in the definition of acquisition proposal to “twenty
percent (20%) or more” are replaced with references to “fifty percent (50%) or more”) which the board concludes in good faith is reasonably
likely to be consummated and would result, if consummated, in a transaction that is more favorable to the stockholders of NewStar from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (after taking into account any changes to the terms of the
merger agreement irrevocably offered in writing by First Eagle and the Asset Buyer in response to such superior proposal).

The summary of the applicable provisions of the asset purchase agreement are included for convenience in this section.

Termination of Agreements to Enter into a Superior Proposal

Prior to obtaining stockholder approval for the merger proposal and the asset sale proposal, NewStar may terminate the merger agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal (and/or the board may make a change in recommendation with respect to a superior proposal) if
and only if:
 

 

•  NewStar has received a bona fide written acquisition proposal (including an acquisition proposal from an excluded party) that was not
solicited in breach of the provisions described above in “—Go Shop; No Solicitation” that the board has determined in good faith constitutes
a superior proposal and NewStar has materially complied with the other provisions described above in “—Go Shop; No Solicitation” with
respect to such acquisition proposal;

 

 
•  the board has determined in good faith that the failure to terminate the merger agreement and/or make such change in recommendation

would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law;

•  NewStar delivers to First Eagle and the Asset Buyer a written notice advising First Eagle and the Asset Buyer that the board proposes to

take such action, which notice contains a copy of the proposed agreement in respect of the superior proposal, including the identity of the
party making such superior proposal;

 

 

•  until 5 p.m., New York time, on the fifth business day following the day on which NewStar delivered such notice, if requested by First Eagle
and the Asset Buyer, NewStar will engage in good faith negotiations with First Eagle, the Asset Buyer and their respective representatives to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement and related agreements so that
such acquisition proposal would cease to constitute a superior proposal;

 

 
•  any revision or amendment to the financial terms or other material terms and conditions of such superior proposal will be deemed to

constitute a new superior proposal and will require a new notice, except that the notice period with respect to such superior proposal
will become three (3) business days instead of five (5) business days; and

 

 

•  following the end of the applicable notice period(s) described above, the board determines in good faith (a) taking into account any

with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Change of Recommendation

At any time prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the merger proposal and asset sale proposal, NewStar or its board may make a change in
recommendation (other than in response to or in respect of an acquisition proposal or a superior proposal) if and only if:
 

 
•  the board determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law as

a result of any event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence relating to or affecting NewStar or its subsidiaries and which was not
known by or reasonably foreseeable to the board as of the date of the merger agreement, which we refer to as an “intervening event”;

take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, which notice will include a description of the applicable intervening event;
 

 

•  until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth business day following the day on which NewStar delivered such notice, if requested by
First Eagle and the Asset Buyer, NewStar will engage in good faith negotiations with First Eagle, the Asset Buyer and their respective
representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement so that the
need for making such change in recommendation would be obviated; and

 

 
•  following such time referred to in the immediately preceding bullet, the board determines in good faith (taking into account any

modifications to the merger agreement and the asset purchase agreement proposed by First Eagle and the Asset Buyer prior to such time)
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Asset Purchase Agreement

Structure of the Asset Sale

At the closing of the asset sale, NewStar will sell to the Asset Buyer (or certain designated subsidiaries thereof) a portfolio of its investment assets,
including loans and other credit investments (and certain related properties, rights, contracts and claims), as further described below, and the Asset
Buyer will assume certain liabilities and obligations of NewStar and its subsidiaries to the extent arising out of or relating to such purchased assets.

The purchased assets include:
 

 
•  certain specified loans, securities, warrants, equity investments and other investments and assets, which we refer to as the “signing date

investments”, that remain outstanding as of the closing;
 

 

•  news loans, securities and other investments and assets acquired or funded by NewStar or certain subsidiaries after the signing of the asset
purchase agreement that remain outstanding as of the closing date, which we refer to as the “new loans”, and all rights, warrants and equity
interests in connection with any new loans, which, together with the new loans and the assets described in the previous bullet, we refer to as
the “purchased investments”;

 

 •  membership interests of certain entities, which we refer to as the “purchased entities”;
 

 •  all rights under the definitive agreements relating to the purchased investments;
 

 •  all accrued interest in respect of the purchased investments that is unpaid as of the closing, which we refer to as the “interest receivable”;
 

 
•  all accrued unused line fees in respect of the purchased investments that are unpaid as of the closing, which we refer to as “unused line

fees”;
 

 •  all rights in the collateral securing any purchased investment;
 

 •  any property that has reverted to NewStar’s ownership or possession upon the default of a borrower under any of the purchased investments;
 

 
•  if certain real property owned by a subsidiary of NewStar, which we refer to as the “owned real property”, is sold prior to closing, an amount

of cash equal to the sale price net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by NewStar in respect of such sale to the extent such sale price is
in excess of ten million ($10,000,000) dollars;

 

 •  copies of all books and records relating primarily to the purchased investments; and
 

 •  the rights of action and claims to the extent related to the purchased assets and assumed liabilities.

At the closing the Asset Buyer will (or will cause the applicable designated buyer entity to) assume and pay, perform and discharge as they become due,
all of the liabilities and obligations of NewStar and its subsidiaries to the extent arising out of or relating to the purchased assets (or to which any
purchased asset is subject), which we refer to as the “assumed liabilities”. The assumed liabilities include:
 

 •  all commitments and obligations to fund or advance additional amounts with respect to the purchased assets;
 

 
•  all obligations under documentation with respect to the purchased assets (including loan and credit agreements, securitization agreements,

note purchase agreements, security agreements and all related modifications, waivers or consents);
 

 
•  all obligations arising out of or relating to the origination, acquisition, ownership, participation, warehousing, sale, assignment, conveyance,

servicing or collection of the purchased assets.

All liabilities and obligations of NewStar or any of its subsidiaries that are not assumed liabilities will be retained by NewStar and its subsidiaries, which
we refer to as the “retained liabilities”.

Table of Contents

When the Asset Sale Is Consummated

The closing of the asset sale will take place on the date that is the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable
law) of the closing conditions set forth in the asset purchase agreement (other than those conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at the
closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions at the closing).

Payment of the Asset Sale Consideration

The purchase price to be paid by the Asset Buyer to NewStar is $2,370,700,000, which will be increased at the closing by the “Estimated Adjustment
Amount” (as described below) if such amount is a positive number and decreased at the closing by the absolute value of the Estimated Adjustment
Amount if such amount is a negative number.

The Estimated Adjustment Amount is calculated based on NewStar’s pre-closing estimates of:
 

 •  the amount of accrued interest receivable; plus
 

 •  the amount of accrued unused line fees; plus
 

 
•  the amount of distributions in respect of certain CLO interests to be included in the purchased investments (based on the number of days in

the then-current payment period with respect to such CLO interest from the date such period commenced through the closing date divided
by the total number of days in such payment period), which we refer to as the “Other Assets”; minus

 

 
•  the “Net Cash Amount” (which may be a positive or negative number), which is the difference between the “Starting Assets” (as described

below) and the “Closing Adjusted Assets” (as described below).
 

 •  “Starting Assets” is calculated by adding:
 

 
•  the aggregate outstanding balance, as of September 30, 2017, of specified loans and CLO notes owned by NewStar as of such

date; plus
 

 
•  the aggregate book value, as of September 30, 2017, of specified rights, warrants and other equity investments owned by

NewStar as of such date.
 

 •  “Closing Adjusted Assets” is calculated by adding:
 

 •  the aggregate outstanding balance of the loans and CLO notes to be acquired by the Asset Buyer at the closing; plus
 

 
•  the aggregate book value of NewStar’s other rights, warrants and other equity investments to be acquired by the Asset Buyer

at the closing; plus
 

 
•  the aggregate amount of any charge offs resulting in a reduction of the principal balance of the related purchased investments

made on or after September 30, 2017; plus
 

 
•  the amount of “Realized Losses”, if any, calculated as the positive difference between (x) the aggregate reserve price for all

assets that have been sold after September 30, 2017 and prior to the closing and (y) the aggregate cash proceeds received by
NewStar from such sales.

 

 
•  Notwithstanding the above calculation, in no event will the Net Cash Amount be less than (i) negative three hundred million dollars

plus (ii) the aggregate unfunded amounts as of the closing in respect of any revolving loan commitments, delayed draw term loans
and similar investments that are purchased investments.

Following the closing, no later than the fifth business day after all “payment dates” for the first quarter of 2018 have occurred with respect to certain
CLO interests described in the third bullet of the calculation of Estimated Adjustment Amount as described above, NewStar will deliver to the Asset
Buyer its calculation of the actual amounts of interest receivable, unused line fees, Other Assets and Net Cash Amount, in each case of the close of
business on the closing date.

Table of Contents

The Asset Buyer will have 10 business days to notify NewStar of any objections to such calculation. If the parties fail to resolve all objections within 10
days following delivery of such dispute notice, then the Asset Buyer and NewStar shall retain a third party national accounting firm to resolve such
dispute. Such accounting firm is to complete its review within 20 days after being requested to conduct such review. The amounts of interest receivable,
unused line fees, Other Assets and Net Cash Amount as agreed by the Asset Buyer and NewStar or as determined by the accounting firm shall be final
and binding on the parties.

If the sum of the finally determined interest receivable, unused line fees and Other Assets minus the finally determined Net Cash Amount is greater than
the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then the Asset Buyer shall pay NewStar the difference. If the Estimated Adjustment Amount is greater than the sum
of the finally determined interest receivable, unused line fees and Other Assets minus the finally determined Net Cash Amount, then NewStar shall pay
the Asset Buyer the difference.

At the same time as the purchase price is finally determined as described in the paragraph above, the Asset Buyer shall deliver to NewStar and the CVR
Committee a schedule allocating such purchase price among the purchased assets, which schedule is to be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code and the applicable treasury regulations thereunder. Within fifteen days following receipt of such schedule the CVR Committee is to provide
notice to the Asset Buyer and NewStar of any objections. In the event the CVR Committee, the Asset Buyer and NewStar are unable to resolve any such
objections within fifteen days following receipt of such dispute notice, the Asset Buyer, Surviving Corporation and the CVR Committee shall engage a
third party accounting firm to resolve such objections and use their reasonable best efforts to cause such accounting firm to resolve such objections
within 15 days following its engagement. As noted above, once such purchase price allocation is determined, the refund return prepared by the CVR
Committee can be finalized, and First Eagle can file such refund return in accordance with the procedures described above.

In determining whether a “material adverse effect” has occurred under the first bullet in the previous sentence, there will be excluded any fact, event,
development, change, effect or occurrence to the extent resulting from the following (except, in the case of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth
bullets below, to the extent they disproportionately adversely affect NewStar and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared to other similarly situated
companies in the financial services industry):

For purposes of the asset purchase agreement, we refer to a “Buyer material adverse effect” as any fact, event, development, change, effect or
occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate with all other facts, events, developments, changes, effects or occurrences, has, or would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Asset Buyer’s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement on
a timely basis.

intact the purchased assets, (y) hold the net proceeds (after repayment of indebtedness) from the sale of any purchased assets in cash or reinvest such

RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL

The following discussion summarizes appraisal rights under the DGCL. The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law relating to
appraisal rights and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, which we refer to as “Section 262”, which is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex E. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that
stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.

Under Section 262, holders of shares of common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who otherwise follow the
procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of
the “fair value” of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.

Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption and approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than
20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for
which appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement shall
constitute such notice, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex E.

ANY HOLDER OF COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, OR WHO WISHES TO PRESERVE SUCH
HOLDER’S RIGHT TO DO SO, SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANNEX E BECAUSE FAILURE TO
TIMELY AND PROPERLY COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURES SPECIFIED WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS.
MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO SEEK APPRAISAL OF SHARES
OF COMMON STOCK, NEWSTAR BELIEVES THAT, IF A STOCKHOLDER CONSIDERS EXERCISING SUCH RIGHTS, SUCH
STOCKHOLDER SHOULD SEEK THE ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL.

Filing Written Demand

Any holder of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must, before the stockholder vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the
special meeting is taken, deliver to NewStar a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and not vote in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement. A holder of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for
appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective date of the merger. The holder must not vote in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement, and it will effectively constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will effectively nullify any
previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must
submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the merger
agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement, nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement, will in and of itself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for
appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy, vote or abstention on the adoption of the merger agreement. The demand must reasonably
inform NewStar of the identity of the holder as well as the intention of the holder to demand an appraisal of the “fair value” of the shares held by the
holder. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting
of stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that holder’s name. A demand for
appraisal in respect of shares of common stock should be executed by or on

Table of Contents

behalf of the holder of record. The demand should set forth the registered holder’s name as it appears on the holder’s stock certificates. A demand for
appraisal will be sufficient if it reasonably informs NewStar of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of
the demand must be made in that capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy-in-common,
the demand must be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a
demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in
executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. If the shares are held in “street name” by a broker, bank or nominee,
the broker, bank or nominee may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising the
rights with respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners; in such case, however, the written demand should set forth the number of shares as to
which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of common stock held in
the name of the record owner. If a stockholder holds shares of common stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities
depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must
identify the depository nominee as record holder. Stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to
exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers or other nominees to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand
for appraisal by such a nominee.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be sent or delivered to NewStar at:

NewStar Financial, Inc.
500 Boylston Street, Suite 1250
Boston, Massachusetts 02116

Attention: Secretary

At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement
by delivering to NewStar, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60
days after the effective date of the merger will require written approval of NewStar. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be
dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger
agreement within 60 days after the effective date of the merger. If NewStar does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that
approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in the
immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a
stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less
than, equal to or more than the consideration being offered pursuant to the merger agreement.

Notice by NewStar

Within ten days after the effective date of the merger, NewStar, as the surviving corporation in the merger, must notify each holder of common stock
who has complied with Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, of the date on which the merger became
effective.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, but not thereafter, NewStar, or any holder of common stock who has complied with Section 262
and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery,
with a copy served upon NewStar in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all
such holders. NewStar is under no obligation to and has no present intention to file a petition and holders should not assume that NewStar will file a
petition. Accordingly, any holders of common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their
appraisal rights in respect of shares of common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger,
any holder of common stock who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from NewStar a
statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which demands for
appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The statement must be mailed within ten days after a written request
therefor has been received by NewStar or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. The
foregoing notwithstanding, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of
such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from NewStar the statement described in this paragraph. If a petition for appraisal
is not timely filed, then the right to appraisal will cease.

If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon NewStar, NewStar will then be
obligated within 20 days to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who
have demanded an appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the
stockholders, the Delaware Court of Chancery will conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with
Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded
appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal
proceeding; and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder.

Notwithstanding a stockholder’s compliance with the foregoing requirements for demanding appraisal and timely commencement of an appraisal
proceeding, the Court of Chancery shall dismiss the proceedings as to all stockholders otherwise entitled to appraisal unless (1) the total number of
shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for
such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.

Determination of Fair Value

After the Delaware Court of Chancery’s determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of common stock, an appraisal proceeding
shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.
Through this proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the shares of common stock as of the effective time of the
merger exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest
from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and
the date of payment of the judgment. When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such fair value, with
interest, if any, by NewStar to the stockholders entitled thereto. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, NewStar may pay to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL only upon the
sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as

Table of Contents

determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by NewStar or by any
stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal
prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by NewStar pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and who has submitted such stockholder’s stock certificates to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate
fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.

In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware
Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered
and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has stated
that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the
enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged
corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does
not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or
expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that “elements of future value, including the
nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.” An
opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the
merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. No representation is made as to the
outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery. In addition, Delaware courts have decided that the statutory
appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenter’s exclusive remedy. You should be aware that the fair value of
your shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration that you
would otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement. NewStar does not anticipate offering greater than the merger
consideration to any stockholder who exercises appraisal rights and reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes
of Section 262 of the DGCL, the fair value of the Common Stock shares is less than the merger consideration.

Costs of the appraisal proceeding may be imposed upon NewStar and the stockholders participating in the appraisal proceeding by the Delaware Court
of Chancery as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon the application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to appraisal. Any
stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will not, after the effective date of the merger, be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to
receive payments of dividends or any other distribution with respect to those shares, other than dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders
of record at a date prior to the effective date of the merger; however, if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the
merger, or if the stockholder delivers a written withdrawal of his, her or its demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the terms of the merger, either
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of that stockholder to
appraisal will cease and that stockholder will be entitled to receive the merger consideration, without interest, for shares of his, her or its common stock
pursuant to the merger agreement.

In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, our stockholders who may wish to dissent from the merger and pursue appraisal rights
should consult their legal advisor. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 262 of the DGCL, the
DGCL shall govern.

If the merger is completed, we will not hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2018. If the merger is not completed, you will continue to be entitled
to attend and participate in our annual meetings of stockholders, and we will hold a 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, in which case we will provide
notice of or otherwise publicly disclose the date on which such 2018 annual meeting will be held. If the 2018 annual meeting is held, stockholder
proposals will be eligible for consideration for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy for our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders in
accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and our bylaws.

Pursuant to the various rules promulgated by the SEC, stockholders interested in submitting a proposal for inclusion in our proxy materials and for
presentation at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders (if one is held) may do so by following the procedures set forth in Rule 14a-8 under the
Exchange Act. To be eligible for inclusion in such proxy materials, stockholder proposals must be received by the Secretary of NewStar at our principal
executive offices no later than January 21, 2018. In order for proposals of stockholders made outside of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act to be
considered “timely” within the meaning of Rule 14a-4(c) under the Exchange Act and under our by-laws, such proposals must have been received by the
Secretary of NewStar at our principal executive offices by January 21, 2018.

Washington, D.C. 20549

November 29, 2017. You should not assume that the information contained in this proxy statement is accurate as of any date other than that date, and the

(ii) one contractual contingent value right (a “Contingent Value Right” and, together with the Upfront Per Share Consideration, the “Merger
Consideration”). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall be cancelled and extinguished automatically, shall no longer
be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each former holder of such shares will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with and subject to this Article II.

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

2.2 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders who have not voted in favor of or consented to the Merger and who are entitled to demand, and have properly demanded, their statutory rights of
appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be
cancelled or converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by
Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such holder’s
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder’s Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been each cancelled and converted, at the
Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law that are
received by the Company relating to stockholders’ rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to lead all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands for payment under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, and prior to the Effective Time
Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, settle or compromise (or offer to settle or compromise) any such demands, approve any
withdrawal of any such demands, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise comply with the provisions under
Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

2.3 Treatment of Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a “Company Option”)
under the 2006 Incentive Plan (as the same may be amended to the date hereof, the “Company Stock Plan”) whether or not vested, which is outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall, without any action on the part of Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
cancelled, and in consideration for such cancelled Company Option, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (less applicable withholding Taxes)
(i) a cash payment (without any interest) equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of (A) the Upfront Per Share Consideration over (B) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option, which payment shall be made by the Surviving Corporation no later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date of
the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time and (ii) one Contingent Value Right for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option. As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right to
receive the consideration therefor, if any, in accordance with and subject to

this Section 2.3(a). Any Company Options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time in exchange for no consideration.

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that is subject to vesting (whether time-based, performance-based, or
otherwise) (“Company Restricted Stock” and together with the Company Options the “Company Equity Awards”) shall, without any action on the part
of Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled upon proper surrender of the
Certificate therefor to receive in consideration for each such cancelled share (less applicable withholding Taxes): (i) a cash payment (without any
interest) equal to the Upfront Per Share Consideration, payable by the Surviving Corporation no later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date of
the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time and (ii) one Contingent Value Right. As of the Effective Time, each holder of Company
Restricted Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right to receive the consideration therefor in accordance with and
subject to this Section 2.3(b). In no event shall this Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.1(b) result in a duplication of benefits in respect to any Company
Restricted Stock.

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt
any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary (i) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.3, and (ii) to ensure that, as of the Effective Time,
(A) the Company Stock Plan shall terminate and (B) no holder of a Company Equity Award shall have any rights with respect thereto, including any
rights to acquire any capital stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, except the right to receive the payment contemplated by this
Section 2.3 in cancellation thereof. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, funds with the Surviving Corporation to
the extent necessary for the Surviving Corporation to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.3(a)(i) and Section 2.3(b)(i).

2.4 Treatment of the Company Warrants. Effective as of the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock that is
then outstanding (each, a “Company Warrant”) shall become exercisable solely for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms thereof and
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable Company Warrant in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall timely deliver all notices as described in Section 2.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter to
each holder of a Company Warrant, and take any other actions to the extent necessary pursuant to the terms of the Company Warrants to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.4.

2.5 Paying Agent.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”). At
the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited (including by directing the Company to deposit the proceeds paid to the Company by the
Asset Buyer in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement), with the Paying Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Upfront Per Share Consideration with respect
to all shares of Company Common Stock (other than Company Restricted Stock, Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) (the “Upfront Consideration
Payment Fund”). With respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall be required to deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent funds
sufficient to pay the aggregate Upfront Per Share Consideration payable in respect of such Dissenting Shares promptly following the holder thereof
failing to perfect or effectively withdrawing or losing its right to dissent under the DGCL.

(b) The cash deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be invested by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by
Parent; provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated
A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, in time or demand deposits, certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital

exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the
time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months. To the
extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Upfront Consideration Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt cash payment of the Upfront Per Share Consideration with respect to shares of Company Common Stock as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore, or cause to be replaced or restored, the portion of the Upfront Consideration Payment Fund lost through
such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Upfront Consideration Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make
such cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Upfront Consideration Payment Fund, and
any amount in excess of the amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Upfront Per Share Consideration with respect to all shares of Company Common
Stock (other than Company Restricted Stock, Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be promptly returned to Parent, Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, as requested by Parent. The funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall not be used for any purpose other than
as contemplated by this Section 2.5.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail or otherwise provide to each former holder of
record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, if any
(each a “Certificate”) and each former holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (“Book-Entry Shares”) (other
than holders of Company Restricted Stock, Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares), transmittal materials, including a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration).

(d) Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for exchange and cancellation to the Paying Agent in accordance with the
terms of such transmittal materials and instructions, the holder of record of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (other than Company Restricted
Stock, Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor, and the Certificate or Book-
Entry Share so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. Promptly after such surrender, the Paying Agent shall pay to the holder thereof an amount
equal to the aggregate Upfront Per Share Consideration for the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares.

(e) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company
Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Paying Agent, upon the provision of reasonable documents by the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer or similar Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II.

(f) Any portion of the Upfront Consideration Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the former stockholders of the Company for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered, at the request of Parent, to Parent, Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation, and any payments with respect to any Contingent Value Rights that any former stockholder is entitled to receive, but has not
properly surrendered the applicable Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for such Contingent Value Rights by the time of the final distribution
of any Remaining Refund Payment, shall be returned to Buyer or the Surviving Corporation by the CVR Agent at Parent’s request upon the final
distribution of any Remaining Refund Payment under Section 2.6(g). Any holders of Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (other than Company Restricted
Stock, Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Upfront Per Share Consideration or such payment with respect to the Contingent Value Rights, as applicable.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of Parent, Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying
Agent, the CVR Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately
prior to such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims of interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine
is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, such
Person shall be entitled to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock represented by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate.

2.6 Contingent Value Rights.

(a) Each holder of a Contingent Value Right shall have the right to receive the payments set forth in this Section 2.6. The Contingent Value
Rights will not represent any equity or ownership interest in the Company, Parent, Buyer or any Affiliate thereof, in any constituent company to the
Merger, or in any other Person and will not be represented by any certificates or other instruments. The Contingent Value Rights will not have any
voting or dividend rights, and except as set forth in Section 2.6(k), no interest shall accrue on any amounts payable on the Contingent Value Rights to
any holder thereof.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Buyer shall designate an agent, which may be the same Person as the Paying Agent, that is
reasonably acceptable to the Company, to hold the Net Tax Refunds in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.6 (the “CVR Agent”).

(c) As a result of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company anticipates that it will
recognize a loss for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes (the “Asset Purchase Loss”). Following the Closing, at the direction of the CVR
Committee, Parent and Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain U.S. federal and state income
tax refunds for the two (2) taxable years ending immediately before the taxable year that ends on and includes the Closing Date and the taxable period
that ends on and includes the Closing Date solely as a result of the Asset Purchase Loss (determined on a with and without basis), including filing IRS
Forms 4466 and 1139, as appropriate (and analogous state tax forms, as applicable) and any necessary amended returns, responding promptly to
questions from taxing authorities and information requests; provided that each of Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the CVR Committee
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, any information or assistance to the others as is reasonably necessary for Parent, Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation and the CVR Committee to comply with their respective obligations under this Section 2.6. In addition, the CVR Committee shall prepare,
or cause to be prepared, any Tax Return on which a claim for a refund is made (a “Refund Return”), including any IRS Form 4466 or 1139, and any such
Refund Return shall be submitted to Parent for its approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and Parent shall
timely file any such Refund Return but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after any such Refund Return has been so approved. Prior to any
such filing, the CVR Committee, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any disputes with respect to any such
Refund Returns; provided that in the event the CVR Committee, Parent and the Surviving Corporation are unable to resolve any such objections within
fifteen (15) days after such Refund Return is submitted to Parent, the CVR Committee, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, within one Business
Day following the end of such fifteen (15) day period, engage Deloitte & Touche LLP, or if Deloitte & Touche is unable to serve, another nationally
recognized accounting firm (the “Accounting Firm”) to resolve such objections, and Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the CVR Committee shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve such objections within fifteen

(15) days following its engagement, which resolution shall be final and binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the CVR Committee (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, the holders of the Contingent Value Rights).

(d) Following the Surviving Corporation’s (or any of its Affiliate’s) receipt of any U.S. federal and state income tax refunds described in
Section 2.6(c), the Surviving Corporation shall promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days following such receipt, deposit (or cause to be
deposited) by wire transfer of immediately available funds the entire amount of such refund, reduced by any increase in U.S. federal income tax liability
resulting from the Surviving Corporation’s receipt of any state income tax refund (as reasonably determined by the Surviving Corporation on a with and
without basis) (any such refund, as so reduced, a “Net Tax Refund”) with the CVR Agent and shall give written notice of such receipt of deposit to the
CVR Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation be required to deposit or distribute any
amounts under this Section 2.6 unless and until the Surviving Corporation (or any of its Affiliates) actually receives the related Net Tax Refund from the
applicable Governmental Entity. Following receipt of any such Net Tax Refund by the CVR Agent, Parent or Buyer shall direct the CVR Agent to
promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to 30% of such Net Tax Refund, and Parent
or Buyer shall direct the Paying Agent to promptly disburse such funds to the holders of Contingent Value Rights, with each Contingent Value Right
entitling the holder thereof to a payment equal to the quotient of (A) the product of (i) 30% multiplied by (ii) the amount of the applicable Net Tax
Refund divided by (B) the number of Contingent Value Rights then outstanding. As used in this Agreement, the “number of Contingent Value Rights
then outstanding” shall be deemed to include, as of such payment date, (i) such number of Contingent Value Rights that former holders of Company
Common Stock who have not properly surrendered their Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for exchange and cancellation to the Paying Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be entitled to receive upon such surrender and (ii) such number of Contingent Value Rights that
would have been issued to holders of Dissenting Shares in the event that such holders’ shares of Company Common Stock had been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b), and the Paying Agent shall disburse to Parent such amount which would otherwise
have been paid in respect of the Contingent Value Rights associated with such Dissenting Shares whenever any amounts are disbursed hereunder to the
holders of Contingent Value Rights. The remainder of such Net Tax Refund shall be held by the CVR Agent in an interest bearing account (the “Tax
Holdback Account”) pursuant to Section 2.6(k) and disbursed in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.6. Any interest earned on the amount in the
Tax Holdback Account shall be for the benefit of the holders of Contingent Value Rights, and Parent or Buyer shall direct the CVR Agent to transfer the
interest then-accrued to date on any funds to be disbursed by the CVR Agent from the Tax Holdback Account to the Paying Agent for payment to the
holders of Contingent Value Rights.

(e) In the event any U.S. federal income tax refund described in Section 2.6(c) is approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation, Parent or
Buyer shall promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after receipt of written notice of such approval) notify the CVR Agent and the
CVR Committee, and Parent or Buyer shall direct the CVR Agent to promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after receipt from Parent
or Buyer of written notice of such approval) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to (i) 60% of the applicable Net Tax Refund plus (ii) any
interest accrued to date on the amount of such Net Tax Refund held in the Tax Holdback Account (clauses (i) and (ii), as may be increased pursuant to
Section 2.6(f), the “JCT Approval Payment”), and Parent or Buyer shall direct the Paying Agent to promptly disburse such funds to the holders of
Contingent Value Rights, with each Contingent Value Right entitling the holder thereof to a payment equal to the quotient of (A) the amount of the JCT
Approval Payment divided by (B) the number of Contingent Value Rights then outstanding. In the event any Net Tax Refund is reduced as a result of a
Determination, the amount set forth in clause (i) above shall be instead the greater of (x) zero and (y) the amount of such Net Tax Refund (as so reduced)
less the amount previously paid with respect to such Net Tax Refund pursuant to Section 2.6(d).

Table of Contents

(f) The first JCT Approval Payment shall be increased by an amount equal to (x) 60% of the Net Tax Refund attributable to any tax refund
previously received that is a “quick refund” of the Company’s estimated payments of U.S. federal income taxes for the taxable year that includes and
ends on the Closing Date plus (y) any interest accrued to date on the amount of such Net Tax Refund held in the Tax Holdback Account. In the event
any such Net Tax Refund is reduced as a result of a Determination, the amount set forth in clause (x) above shall be instead the greater of (1) zero and
(2) the amount of such Net Tax Refund (as so reduced) less the amount previously paid with respect to such Net Tax Refund pursuant to Section 2.6(d).

(g) Parent or Buyer shall direct the CVR Agent to promptly deposit with the Paying Agent, and give written notice of such deposit to the
CVR Committee, an amount equal to (i) the remaining amount of any Net Tax Refund plus (ii) any interest accrued to date on the amount of such Net
Tax Refund held in the Tax Holdback Account (clauses (i) and (ii), as may be reduced pursuant to the proviso below, the “Remaining Refund Payment”)
upon the earlier of: (x) the expiration of the statute of limitations (without taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof that were initiated by
the Company unilaterally and without consultation with the CVR Committee, and without application of special statutes of limitations for substantial
understatement, substantial omission, fraud or similar circumstances) applicable to the IRS’s review of the Tax Return for the taxable year to which such
Net Tax Refund relates and (y) the time that the IRS closes its income tax audit of the Surviving Corporation for the taxable year to which such Net Tax
Refund relates (in which case all remaining funds in the Tax Holdback Account related to such Net Tax Refund shall be deposited with the Paying
Agent). Parent or Buyer shall direct the Paying Agent to promptly disburse the Remaining Refund Payment to the holders of Contingent Value Rights,
with each Contingent Value Right entitling the holder thereof to a payment equal to the quotient of (A) the amount of the Remaining Refund Payment
divided by (B) the number of Contingent Value Rights then outstanding.

(h) In the event any Net Tax Refund is reduced as a result of a Determination, Parent or Buyer shall direct the CVR Agent to disburse to the
Surviving Corporation an amount equal to the cash tax owed (computed on a with and without basis) as a result of such reduction, which disbursement
shall reduce the amount held in the Tax Holdback Account. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a Determination that does not reduce the amount
of such Net Tax Refund, no funds shall be disbursed to the Surviving Corporation from the Tax Holdback Account. Furthermore, holders of Contingent
Value Rights shall have no obligation to return or forfeit any amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.6 in the event that, after any such payment, there is
a Determination that adversely affects any of the Net Tax Refunds.

(i) Prior to the Closing, the Company will form a committee (comprised of one individual reasonably acceptable to Parent) (the “CVR
Committee”) with authority to monitor compliance with the foregoing and enforce, on behalf of the holders of Contingent Value Rights, the obligations
of Parent, Buyer and the Company pursuant to this Section 2.6. The member of the CVR Committee shall have the authority to determine and appoint
any successor member to the CVR Committee reasonably acceptable to Parent; provided that, prior to the Closing, the Company will designate an
alternate individual reasonably acceptable to Parent to serve on the CVR Committee in the event of the death or disability of the member of the CVR
Committee or the resignation of such member without designation of a successor. The CVR Committee shall be an express third party beneficiary of the
provisions of this Section 2.6 with full authority on behalf of the holders of Contingent Value Rights to enforce the provisions hereof and to settle,
negotiate or compromise any claims hereunder. Any decision, act or instruction of the CVR Committee with respect to the matters set forth in this
Section 2.6 shall be final, binding and conclusive on all holders of Contingent Value Rights. The reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of the CVR Committee, including reasonable and documented fees for counsel and accountants and reasonable compensation for service of the
members of such committee as set forth on Section 2.6(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be paid by Parent, and Parent shall indemnify each
person who is or was a member of the CVR Committee on the terms set forth in Section 2.6(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(j) Parent, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain the maximum amount of Net Tax Refunds
reasonably available and as reflected on the relevant Refund Return,

(ii) cooperate with audits, and challenge in good faith through appropriate administrative or court proceedings any determination by a taxing authority or
court adversely affecting all or any portion of such refunds where, after consultation with Parent, the CVR Committee has determined (after consultation
with its accounting advisors and outside counsel) that such challenge has a reasonable possibility of success and (iii) provide the CVR Committee and
its counsel and accountants with reasonable access to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation, Buyer and Parent relevant to the Net Tax
Refunds, including submissions to and reports or correspondence from the IRS. Parent, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall keep the CVR
Committee informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of the foregoing, including by promptly informing the CVR Committee of all
proceedings, material correspondence and substantive meetings and discussions with the IRS; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not
provide copies of any of its or its Affiliates’ Tax Returns to the CVR Committee (other than the Refund Returns or Tax Returns related solely to the
Refund Returns). Parent, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall give the CVR Committee the opportunity to control any such audit, dispute or
Action, and Parent, Buyer and the Surviving Corporation or the CVR Committee, as applicable, shall not settle or agree to settle any such audit, dispute
or Action without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(k) The cash deposited with the CVR Agent pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be invested by the CVR Agent as set forth on Section 2.6(k) of
the Company Disclosure Letter. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments that cause the Tax Holdback Account to diminish
below the level required to make cash payments to the holders of Contingent Value Rights as contemplated by this Section 2.6, Parent or Buyer shall
have no obligation to replace or restore, or cause to be replaced or restored, such portion of the funds in the Tax Holdback Account (or any obligation to
replace or restore any interest or other income from any investment of the Net Tax Refunds in the Tax Holdback Account). Any interest and other
income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Tax Holdback Account. The funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.6 shall not be used for any purpose other than as contemplated by this Section 2.6.

(l) The Contingent Value Rights may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered in any manner, other than transfers by will
or intestacy, by inter vivos or testamentary trust where the Contingent Value Right is to be passed to the beneficiaries upon the death of the trustee,
pursuant to a court order, by operation of law, or in connection with the dissolution, liquidation or termination of a corporation, limited liability
company, partnership or other entity which is the holder thereof.

(m) The CVR Agent shall keep a register (the “CVR Register”) for the purpose of registering Contingent Value Rights and transfers of
Contingent Value Rights as herein provided. The CVR Register shall show one position for Cede & Co representing all the shares of Company Common
Stock held by the Depositary Trust Company (“DTC”) on behalf of the street name holders of the shares of Company Common Stock held by such
holders as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and any payments to be made under this Section 2.6 to any street holders of shares of Company
Common Stock shall be accomplished by the Paying Agent sending one lump payment to DTC. Neither Parent, Buyer, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or the CVR Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any responsibilities whatsoever with regard to the
distribution of payments by DTC to such street name holders. In the case of any other former holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
Company Restricted Stock or Company Options, the Contingent Value Rights shall be registered in the name and address of such former holder of
record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, Company Restricted Stock or Company Options as such names and addresses are provided to Parent by or
on behalf of the Company prior to the Closing.

(n) A holder of a Contingent Value Right may make a written request to the CVR Agent to change such holder’s address of record in the
CVR Register. The written request must be duly executed by the holder. Subject to any reasonable procedures imposed by the CVR Agent, the CVR
Agent shall promptly record the change of address in the CVR Register upon receipt of such written notice.

(o) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in Section 2.6(l), every request made to transfer a Contingent Value Right must be
in writing and accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form

reasonably satisfactory to Parent or Buyer, the CVR Committee and the CVR Agent, duly executed by the holder thereof, his, her or its attorney duly
authorized in writing, personal representative or survivor and setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of
such written notice, the CVR Agent shall, subject to its reasonable determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer otherwise
complies with the other terms and conditions herein, register the transfer of the Contingent Value Rights in the CVR Register. Parent, Buyer and the
CVR Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other tax or governmental charge that is imposed in connection with any
such registration of transfer. No transfer of a Contingent Value Right shall be valid until registered in the CVR Register, and any transfer not duly
registered in the CVR Register will be void ab initio.

(p) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the holder of a Contingent Value Right may at any time at its option abandon
all of its remaining rights in a Contingent Value Right by written notice to the CVR Agent and Buyer or by transfer of such Contingent Value Right to
Buyer without consideration therefor. Nothing in this Section 2.6 is intended to prohibit Parent or Buyer from offering to acquire Contingent Value
Rights for consideration in its sole discretion.

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all of the Clients, including all Company Funds and, with respect to each Client,
(i) the Investment Advisory Agreement and all other Contracts pursuant to which the Company and its Subsidiaries provide investment advisory,
investment sub-advisory, collateral management or similar services to the Client, (ii) the Client Consent required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the parties from whom such Client Consent must be obtained and the manner in which such Client Consent
may be obtained in accordance with applicable Law and applicable Fund Documentation or Contracts) and (iii) the Assets Under Management and Run
Rate Revenue for such Client as of the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the date of this Agreement (or the last
practicable date prior to such date for which Assets Under Management for any such Client is available as indicated therein) (such date, the “Base
Date”; and such Run Rate Revenue, which shall exclude any Client that Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter indicates is to be excluded,
the “Base Date Run Rate Revenue”). Other than the Persons listed on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter or acting as managing member
of a Subsidiary that is a limited liability company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries acts as investment adviser, investment sub-adviser,
collateral manager, general partner, managing member, manager or administrator to, or receives fees from, any other Person.

For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) “Assets Under Management” means, with respect to any Client, as of a specified date, the dollar amount of assets under
management in respect of which the Company and its Subsidiaries are entitled to investment advisory and investment management fees from such
Client as of such date; provided, however, that the calculation of Assets Under Management shall exclude any increase or decrease in Assets
Under Management resulting from market appreciation or depreciation or currency fluctuations from and after the Base Date.

(ii) “Run Rate Revenue” means, with respect to any Client, as of a specified date, the aggregate annualized investment advisory and
investment management fees payable to the Company and its Subsidiaries, determined by multiplying the Assets Under Management for such
Client as of such specified date (or the last practicable date prior to such specified date for which Assets Under Management for any such Client is
available) by the applicable annual base fee rate for such Client under the applicable Investment Advisory Agreement at such specified date (not
including any performance-based, incentive or similar fees), after taking into account any fee rebates or fee sharing arrangements. Run Rate
Revenue shall be calculated to exclude any Client indicated on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter to be excluded from such
calculation.

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the material Fund Documentation of each Company
Fund.

(c) Each Company Fund has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its

Each Company Fund is duly qualified, licensed or registered to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction where it is required to do so under
applicable Law except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or registered that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(d) All shares or other ownership interests in each of the Company Funds were sold in accordance with, in all material respects, applicable
securities Law and their respective Fund Documentation and have been duly authorized and are validly issued and (if applicable) fully-paid and non-
assessable.

(e) To the knowledge of the Company, based on the representations from each Person that is, or that holds an interest in, a Client no portion
of the assets of any such Client constitutes the assets of a “benefit plan investor” within the meaning of the U.S. Department of Labor Regulation 29
C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101(f) (as modified by Section 3(42) of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). No “bad
actor” disqualifying event described in Rule 506(d)(i)-(viii) under the Securities Act is applicable to any officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(f) To the knowledge of the Company, no Fund Documentation or other offering materials or disclosure documents issued or used by a
Company Fund, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a Company Fund, contained at the time it was issued or used any untrue
statement of a material fact, or any omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading.

(g) Since January 1, 2014, to the knowledge of the Company, there have been no claims made in writing or threatened in writing by any
Client or investor in any Company Fund alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of investment guidelines or restrictions, or violation of any applicable
Law.

(h) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Company Fund is, or at any time was, required to register as an investment company under
the Investment Company Act. Each of the Company Funds that rely on Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act has been operated in a manner
that permits it to satisfy the exemption to registration contained in Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act and each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been operated in a manner that permits them to satisfy the exemption from the definition of investment company in Section 3(a)(1)(C)
of the Investment Company Act.

(i) Except as set forth on Section 3.11(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor any
Company Fund is party to any Contract under which it pays or receives any rebate or commission payable to a broker, solicitor, or placement agent, or
other financial inducement to direct business.

(j) Each existing Investment Advisory Agreement is in writing and is in compliance with the Advisers Act (to the extent applicable) and
applicable Law, and since January 1, 2014 (or the date of such Investment Advisory Agreement or the date the Company acquired the Investment
Adviser Entity party to such Investment Advisory Arrangement, in each case if such date is after January 1, 2014), has been performed by the applicable
Investment Adviser Entity in accordance with its terms and applicable Law, in each case, in all material respects. Since January 1, 2014 (or the date the
Company acquired the applicable Investment Adviser Entity, if such date is after January 1, 2014), each Client account has been managed and advised
(and the fees and expenses payable thereunder have been calculated and charged) in compliance with the terms of the applicable Investment Advisory
Agreement, its investment guidelines and restrictions, any Fund Documentation, the Advisers Act and applicable Law, in each case, in all material
respects.

(k) Except as set forth on Section 3.11(k) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there is no Contract in effect pursuant to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries have undertaken or agreed to cap, discount, waive or reimburse any or all fees or charges payable by any of the Clients.

(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Acquisition Proposal involving an Excluded Party), including revised copies of drafts of proposed
agreements, term sheets or letters of intent related thereto provided to the Company or any of its Representatives. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt basis of the status of any Acquisition Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5, beginning on the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the
Requisite Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company or any of its Representatives receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not
solicited in breach of this Section 5.5, including from an Excluded Party (whether received from such Excluded Party prior to, on or after the No-Shop
Period Start Date), and the Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith (i) after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with its outside
counsel that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may,
prior to receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval, (A) engage in, enter into or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
with such Person who has made such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) and (B) provide information (including non-public information)
regarding, and afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records and personnel of, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its affiliates to such
Person who has made such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives); provided that (y) prior to engaging in any discussions or negotiations or
providing any non-public information or access the Company must enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and (z) the
Company shall provide to Parent any such non-public information that is provided to any such Person that was not previously made available to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person.

(f) Except as expressly permitted by the other provisions of this Section 5.5, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) withhold, withdraw,
amend, qualify or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company

respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to recommend against any tender or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business Days of the commencement (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act)
thereof (or if the Company Stockholders Meeting is to occur earlier than the end of such ten (10) Business Day period, at least one (1) Business Day
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting) or (v) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any of the foregoing in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) a “Change in Company Recommendation”).

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.5 to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company may terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(g) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal (and/or the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Change in Company Recommendation with respect to a Superior Proposal) if and

Company’s Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) constitutes a
Superior Proposal and the Company has materially complied with the other provisions of this Section 5.5 with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal;

(ii) the Company’s Board of Directors has determined in good faith that the failure to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 7.1(g) and/or make such Change in Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law;

(iii) the Company delivers to Parent and the Asset Buyer a written notice (a “Superior Proposal Notice”) advising Parent and the Asset
Buyer that the Company’s Board of Directors proposes to take such action and containing a copy of the proposed agreement in respect of
the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action of the Board of Directors of the Company, including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal;

(iv) until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately following the day on which the Company
delivered the Superior Proposal Notice (the “Notice Period”), if requested by Parent and the Asset Buyer, the Company will, and will cause
its Representatives to, engage in good faith negotiations with Parent, Asset Buyer and their respective Representatives to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement and related agreements so that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood that any revision or amendment to the financial
terms or other material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a new Superior Proposal and shall
require a new Superior Proposal Notice, except that the Notice Period with respect to such Superior Proposal will become three (3) Business
Days instead of five (5) Business Days); and

(v) following the end of the Notice Period(s) referred to above, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(a) after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor, and taking into account any modifications to this Agreement and the
Asset Purchase Agreement proposed by Parent and the Asset Buyer prior to such time, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal and (b) after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.5 to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company or its Board of Directors may make a Change in Company Recommendation other than in response to or in respect of an
Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal if and only if:

(i) the Company’s Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law as a result of any event, fact, circumstance, development or
occurrence relating to or affecting the Company or its Subsidiaries, including the business, operations, assets or liabilities of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, and which was not known by or reasonably foreseeable to the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) as
of the date of this Agreement (an “Intervening Event”); provided, however, that in no event shall any action taken by the Company in order
to comply with the covenants set forth in this Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement, and the consequences of any such action,
constitute an Intervening Event;

(ii) the Company delivers to Parent and the Asset Buyer a written notice (an “Intervening Event Notice”) advising Parent and the Asset
Buyer that the Company’s Board of Directors proposes to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, which notice shall include a
description of the applicable Intervening Event;

(iii) until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately following the day on which the Company
delivered the Intervening Event Notice, if requested by Parent and the Asset Buyer, the Company will, and will cause its Representatives to,

with Parent, the Asset Buyer and their respective Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Asset Purchase Agreement so that the need for making such Change in Company Recommendation would be obviated; and

(iv) following such time referred to in clause (iii) above, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel, and taking into account any modifications to this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement
proposed by Parent and the Asset Buyer prior to such time) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

In the event that the Company delivers Parent a Superior Proposal Notice or an Intervening Event Notice, the Company shall have been deemed to have
automatically waived any standstill to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party solely for the limited purpose of permitting Parent, Buyer and
Merger Sub to negotiate with the Company in accordance with the terms of clause (g) or (h) above, as applicable.

(i) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), (ii) making a customary “stop-look-and-listen”
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of the Company) or (iii) making any legally required disclosure to stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that in each case of (i), (ii) and (iii), the Company expressly publicly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation in such disclosure and does not include any statement that itself would be a Change in Company Recommendation.

(j) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, or until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives not to, and shall not assist or facilitate Asset Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, solicit or initiate discussions or engage in negotiations with, or provide information to, the Asset Buyer with respect
to any potential sale of or transaction involving the Company other than the transactions with Parent contemplated by this Agreement and the Asset
Purchase Agreement.

(k) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings assigned below:

(i) “Acquisition Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than a joint offer from Parent, Buyer, Merger
Sub and the Asset Buyer) with respect to (x) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly (including by way of tender offer or
exchange offer, merger, consolidation, sale of equity interests, share exchange, business combination or otherwise) of securities (or options,
rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into, such securities) representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (or of securities representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the total voting power of the
Company) or (y) the acquisition (directly or indirectly and whether by transfer, merger, consolidation, equity investment or otherwise) of
twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets (including stock of the Company’s Subsidiaries) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

(ii) “Excluded Party” means any Person from whom the Company or any of its Representatives has received a written Acquisition
Proposal after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, which written Acquisition Proposal the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined in good faith prior to the start of the No-Shop Period Start Date (after consultation with its outside
counsel and its financial advisor) is or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that a Person shall
immediately cease to be an Excluded Party if (A) such Acquisition Proposal made by such Person prior to the start of the No-Shop Period
Start Date is

withdrawn (it being understood that any amendment, modification or replacement of such Acquisition Proposal shall not, in and of itself, be
deemed a withdrawal of such Acquisition Proposal) or (B) such Acquisition Proposal, in the good faith determination of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisor), no longer is or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

(iii) “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (except that, for the purpose of this definition of Superior
Proposal, all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to “twenty percent (20%) or more” will be deemed to be references to
“fifty percent (50%) or more”) which the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside counsel, is reasonably likely to be consummated and would result, if consummated, in a transaction that is more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after
taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent and the Asset Buyer in response to
such Superior Proposal pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.5(g)).

5.6 Employees; Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) From the Closing Date through December 31, 2018, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to those employees who are, as
of the Effective Time, employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries and remain so employed (the “Continuing Employees”) annual base salary and
base wages, and cash incentive compensation opportunities, that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to such annual base salary and base wages, and
cash incentive compensation opportunities provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall entitle Continuing
Employees to participate in any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any other direct or
indirect Subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the “Parent Plans”) as similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt,
in determining cash incentive compensation opportunities for the calendar year ending December 31, 2018 to be provided to Continuing Employees,
such amounts will be no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those earned by the Company Employees prior to the Effective Time for the calendar year
ending December 31, 2017, regardless of when any such amounts are paid.

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to, (i) give Continuing Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under the Parent Plans, for such Continuing Employees’ service with the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company (or any predecessor entity) to the same extent recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries under similar Plans, (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit plan that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time, and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide credit under any such welfare plan for any co-payments,
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenditures for the remainder of the coverage period during which any transfer of coverage occurs; provided, however,
that no such service shall be recognized to the extent such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to the cash incentive awards applicable to any Continuing
Employee for calendar year 2017 (as to each Continuing Employee, a “2017 Bonus”), if the Closing occurs (x) during the 2017 calendar year, the
Company shall pay at Closing (fully in cash) to each Continuing Employee, the 2017 Bonus set forth on Section 3.14(h) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, in each case prorated (except as set forth on Section 3.14(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter) to reflect the portion of the year elapsed between
January 1, 2017 and the Closing Date and (y) during the 2018 calendar year, but prior to the payment of the 2017 Bonus to the Continuing Employees,
the Company shall pay at Closing (fully in cash) to each Continuing Employee, an amount equal to such Continuing Employee’s 2017 Bonus set forth
on Section 3.14(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

Table of Contents

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Closing does not occur during the 2017 calendar year, the Company
shall be permitted to establish the terms and conditions of the cash incentive awards applicable to Continuing Employees for calendar year 2018 (the
“2018 Bonus”) in consultation with Parent and subject to Parent’s written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) prior to any approval, implementation, communication or disclosure with respect to the 2018 Bonus.

(e) Without limiting the provisions of Section 5.6(a) and Section 5.6(b) above, in the event that a Continuing Employee’s employment with
the Surviving Corporation (or such other controlled Affiliate of Parent following the Closing that such Continuing Employee is employed by) is
terminated by the Surviving Corporation (or such other controlled Affiliate of Parent following the Closing that such Continuing Employee is employed
by) other than for cause (as reasonably determined by the Surviving Corporation or applicable controlled Affiliate of Parent) within the twelve
(12) month period immediately following the Closing Date, such terminated Continuing Employee shall receive severance benefits no less favorable
than those set forth on Section 5.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Any such severance shall be subject to the terminated Continuing Employee’s
signing a separation agreement containing a general release of claims in a form and manner satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation or applicable
controlled Affiliate of Parent. The provisions of this Section 5.6(e) shall not apply to any Continuing Employee who, in the event of such termination, is
eligible for severance under any other then applicable agreement (including any employment, severance or change of control agreement). In no event
shall this Section 5.6(e) result in a duplication of severance pay or benefits for any Continuing Employee.

(f) The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide for the termination of the Company’s 2016 Co-Investment Plan, such that all
awards issued thereunder shall be terminated and cashed out in accordance with their terms, at or before the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time,
each holder of an award under the Company’s 2016 Co-Investment Plan shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right to
receive payment therefor, if any.

(g) If directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Plans
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event
that Parent requests that such 401(k) plans(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and reasonable
approval by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(h) The provisions of this Section 5.6 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of doubt any Continuing Employees, present or former
employees or directors, consultants or independent contractors of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on
or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties and their respective permitted successors and
assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 5.6) under or by reason of any
provision of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 5.6 or elsewhere in the Agreement shall be construed to prevent, from and after the
Effective Time, the termination of employment of any individual Continuing Employee or, subject to the provisions of Section 5.6(a), any change in the
employee benefits available to any Continuing Employee or the amendment or termination of any particular Plan in accordance with its terms.

5.7 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ and Other Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless, as and
to the fullest extent provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement and permitted by
applicable Law, each present and

former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (the “Indemnified Parties”), against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or awards paid in settlement or
incurred in connection with any actual or threatened Action, arising out of, relating to or in connection with matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur at or prior to the Effective Time), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and
shall advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Action, including any expenses incurred in
enforcing such Person’s rights under this Section 5.7; provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides a written undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.7.

(b) The provisions in the Surviving Corporation’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers shall be no less favorable to such directors and officers than such provisions
contained in the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not, except to the extent
required by applicable Law, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

(c) Prior to or at the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase from insurance carriers, following reasonable consultation with Parent, six
(6) year prepaid “tail policies” for directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance providing at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are at least as advantageous to the insureds as the current policies maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from actual or alleged acts, errors or omissions that occurred at or before the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such “tail policies” in
full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not pay more than
250% of the most recent annual premium paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time in respect of each such policy described in the first sentence
of this Section 5.7(d), but in case such coverage is not available for such amount, the Company shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount. In addition, if requested by and with the consultation and consent of Parent, prior to or at the Effective Time, the Company
shall purchase prepaid “tail policies” with respect to claims arising from actual or alleged acts, errors or omissions that occurred at or before the
Effective Time for (i) employment practices liability insurance; (ii) “cyber” and data security liability insurance; and/or (iii) professional/errors and
omissions liability insurance, including any “claims-made” fidelity bond, surety bond or similar coverage.

(d) Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by the
Company with any director or officer prior to the date hereof and that are set forth on Section 5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.7 shall survive the Merger and, following the Effective Time, are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and representatives.

(g) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.7 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the comparable

governing instruments of any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors
and employees, it being understood that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.7 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under
any such policies.

5.8 Advice of Changes. Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event of which it becomes aware which it
believes would or would be reasonably likely to prevent the satisfaction of any condition to closing set forth in Article VI hereof; provided, however,
that any noncompliance with this Section 5.8 shall not be taken into account in determining whether the condition set forth in Section 6.2(b) or
Section 6.3(b) has been satisfied or give rise to any right of termination under Article VII.

5.9 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause
any disposition of shares of Company Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of shares of Company Common Stock in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

5.10 Publicity. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement (other than in the case of the Company, a Change in Company
Recommendation and related public statements or any other statements contemplated by Section 5.5(i)) without the prior consent of the other party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but
after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances) issue such press release or make such public statement as may, upon the advice of
outside counsel, be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any applicable securities exchange. Parent and the Company agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement shall be a joint press
release in the form agreed to by the Company, Parent and Asset Buyer.

5.11 Transaction Litigation. In the event that any Transaction Litigation is brought, or threatened to be brought, against the Company or any
members of its Board of Directors after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing
of any such Transaction Litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof, including by promptly informing Parent
of all proceedings and correspondence relating to such Transaction Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense of any Transaction Litigation, including the right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in
connection therewith and the right to provide advice with respect to the Transaction Litigation as to which the Company shall give due consideration.
The Company shall not settle or agree to settle any Transaction Litigation without Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

5.12 Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of
NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock from NASDAQ as promptly as practicable
after (and only after) the Effective Time and the deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time.

5.13 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and the members of their respective boards of directors shall grant such
approvals and take all actions as are necessary so that such transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Asset Purchase

Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Takeover Statute on such transactions. The Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or under the Asset Purchase Agreement.

5.14 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

5.15 Client Consents.

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Client Consents; provided that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to offer or grant any material accommodation or material alteration of terms (financial or otherwise) to obtain such
required Consents.

(b) The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of obtaining the Client Consents and shall, prior to the Closing, make
available to Parent copies of all such executed Client Consents and, upon reasonable prior notice from Parent, make available for Parent’s inspection the
originals of such Client Consents and any related materials and other records relating to such consent process. Without limiting the foregoing, in
connection with obtaining the Client Consents, the Company shall obtain Parent’s approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed) of the form and substance of any notice or other materials to be distributed to the Client or other Persons in order to obtain the
necessary Client Consent.

(c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent after the receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any written notice that any
Client (i) has ceased or will cease to use any services of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) has substantially reduced, or will substantially
reduce, the use of services of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) has sought, or is seeking, to reduce any fees it will pay for any services of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

5.16 Asset Purchase Agreement. The Company shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to comply with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement,

consent of the Company and the Asset Buyer. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of the transactions
contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, including by (A) providing Parent a copy of all notices received by the Company from the Asset Buyer
or provided by the Company to the Asset Buyer under the Asset Purchase Agreement and (B) notifying the Company as promptly as practicable (and in
any event within one Business Day) upon becoming aware of any event that has given rise to, or that would reasonably be expected to give rise to, a
right of termination by either party under the Asset Purchase Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, none of Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub shall be
responsible for any actions or inactions of Asset Buyer. Notwithstanding any term of the Asset Purchase Agreement, (a) if the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is permitted to take an action under the Asset Purchase Agreement but is prohibited from taking (or otherwise restricted in taking) such
action under this Agreement, the Company shall not take such action (or shall otherwise comply with the restrictions in respect of such action) and (b) if
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is permitted not to take an action under the Asset Purchase Agreement but it is required to take such action under
this Agreement, the Company shall (or shall cause its Subsidiary to) take such action.

5.17 Fund Matters.

(a) The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the occurrence of any event described in Section 3.11(m) or (n) and shall make available
to Parent any Trustee’s or other report from a Company Fund or a service provider to a Company Fund that is provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or to investors in any Company Fund after the date of this Agreement.

(c) by either Parent or the Company, by written notice to the other party, if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before April 16,

terminate if any action of such party (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) or the failure of such party (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) to perform

delivered to Parent and Asset Buyer no later than the date that is fourteen (14) days after the No-Shop Period Start Date or (ii) this Agreement is
terminated under Section 7.1(h) after the Asset Purchase Agreement has been terminated under Section 7.1(g) of the Asset Purchase Agreement in a
circumstance in which a Go Shop Termination Fee (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) was payable to the Asset Buyer under Section 7.2(c)
therein; provided further that in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), the payment of the Go Shop Termination Fee shall be made concurrently with or prior to
such termination of this Agreement.

(c) The Company shall pay Parent (or its designee), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to $4.5 million (the
“Termination Fee”) if (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(f), which payment shall be made within two (2) Business Days
of the date of such termination, (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(g) in a circumstance in which the Go Shop
Termination Fee is not payable or (iii) this Agreement is terminated under Section 7.1(h) after the Asset Purchase Agreement has been terminated under
Section 7.1(f) or Section 7.1(g) of the Asset Purchase Agreement in a circumstance in which the Termination Fee (as defined in the Asset Purchase
Agreement) was payable to Asset Buyer under Section 7.2(d) therein; provided that in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), the payment of the Termination
Fee shall be made concurrently with or prior to such termination of this Agreement.

(d) If (1) this Agreement is terminated by (A) either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(e), (B) by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(c), (C) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(h) if and only if the Asset Purchase Agreement was terminated
(x) by the Company or the Asset Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.1(e) therein or (y) by the Asset Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(d) therein,
or (D) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d), and (2) (x) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company (but not publicly announced) and
such Acquisition Proposal has not been unconditionally withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement or (y) an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been publicly announced at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement and (3) within twelve (12) months
after such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall pay Parent (or its designee), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Termination Fee on or before the second
Business Day after the date such Acquisition Proposal is consummated. For purposes of this Section 7.2(d), all references to “20% or more” in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall instead refer to “50% or more”.

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay both the Go Shop Termination Fee and the
Termination Fee, it being understood and agreed that only one payment of either the Go Shop Termination Fee or the Termination Fee shall ever be
payable hereunder. The Company, Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub agree that the agreements contained in Section 7.2 are integral parts of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that neither the Go Shop Termination Fee nor the Termination Fee shall constitute a penalty but are liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. If, in order
to obtain such payment of the Go Shop Termination Fee or the Termination Fee, Parent commences a suit against the Company that results in a
judgment for the payment of the Go Shop Termination Fee or Termination Fee, as applicable, the Company shall also be required to pay to Parent
interest on the termination fee that was so payable at the annual rate equal to the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made, through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law (“Interest Expense”).

(f) Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Go Shop Termination
Fee or Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable by the Company pursuant to this Section 7.2, Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub shall be precluded from
any remedy against the Company, at law or in equity or otherwise other than payment by the Company to Parent of such Go Shop

contemplated hereby (or the Asset Purchase Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby).

the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such

8.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or

effort to agree upon a valid and enforceable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties.

8.11 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of any party hereunder shall be assigned by any of the

EXHIBIT A

AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

OF

NEWSTAR FINANCIAL, INC.

NewStar Financial, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware since its original incorporation date of
May 27, 2004 (the “Corporation”) under the name “Novus Capital, Inc.,” pursuant to Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the “DGCL”), hereby certifies as follows:
 

FIRST:   The name of the Corporation is NewStar Financial, Inc.

SECOND:
  

The Corporation’s registered office in the State of Delaware is 1209 Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, County of New
Castle, 19801, and the name of its registered agent at such address is: The Corporation Trust Company.

THIRD:
  

The purpose of the Corporation is to carry on any and all business and to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations
may be organized under the DGCL.

FOURTH:   The total number of shares of stock which this Corporation is authorized to issue is:

  One Hundred (100) shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share.

FIFTH:
  

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors is expressly
authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the by-laws of the Corporation (the “By-laws”).

SIXTH:   Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the By-laws shall so provide.

SEVENTH:   

            A.

  

Limitations on Liability. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to
the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived any improper
personal benefit. If the DGCL is amended after the effective date of this Certificate of Incorporation to further eliminate or limit the
liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided
herein, shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. No amendment, modification or repeal of this
Article SEVENTH shall adversely affect the rights and protection afforded to a director of the Corporation under this Article
SEVENTH for acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment, modification or repeal.

            B.

  

Indemnification of Directors and Officers. Each person who is or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved
in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a “proceeding”), by reason of
the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while serving as such director or officer, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, including, without limitation, service with respect to employee benefit plans, shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended
(but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability
and loss (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement) actually and

reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe the person’s conduct was unlawful, and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of such person’s heirs, executors and
administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in the second paragraph of this Part B, the Corporation shall indemnify
any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred in this section shall be
a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation for any expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding
in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a
director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made only
upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay all amounts so advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this section or otherwise. The
Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the
same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.

  

If a claim under the first paragraph of this Part B is not paid in full by the Corporation within twenty (20) days after such claim has
been received in writing by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the
unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of
prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses
incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been
tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL for the
Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made
a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances
because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct.

  

The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition
conferred in this Part B shall not be exclusive of, and the Corporation is authorized to honor or provide, any other right that any
person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, which other right may provide indemnification and advancement in excess of
the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, subject only to limits created by applicable
Delaware law (statutory or non-statutory), with respect to actions for breach of duty to the Corporation, its stockholders and others.

            C.

  

Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the
DGCL.

            D.

  

Repeal and Modification. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article SEVENTH shall not adversely
affect any right or protection of any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or
modification.

EIGHTH:

EXHIBIT B

AMENDED AND RESTATED BY-LAWS

of

NEWSTAR FINANCIAL, INC.
(the “Corporation”)

1. Stockholders

(a) Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors each year at such place, date and time as
shall be designated by the Board of Directors. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting. If no date for the annual meeting is
established or said meeting is not held on the date established as provided above, a special meeting in lieu thereof may be held or there may be action by
written consent of the stockholders on matters to be voted on at the annual meeting, and such special meeting or written consent shall have for the
purposes of these By-laws or otherwise all the force and effect of an annual meeting.

(b) Special Meetings. Special meetings of stockholders may be called by the Chief Executive Officer, if one is elected, or, if there is no
Chief Executive Officer, a President, or by the Board of Directors, but such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons. The call
for the meeting shall state the place, date, hour and purposes of the meeting. Only the purposes specified in the notice of special meeting shall be
considered or dealt with at such special meeting.

(c) Notice of Meetings. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice stating the place, if any,
date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present and
vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes of the meeting, shall be given by the Secretary (or other person
authorized by these By-laws or by law) not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote
thereat and to each stockholder who, under the Certificate of Incorporation or under these By-laws is entitled to such notice. If mailed, notice is given
when deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, directed to such stockholder at such stockholder’s address as it appears in the records of the Corporation.
Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be effectively given to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by electronic
transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”).

If a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, and the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, except that if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment
a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the
meeting.

(d) Quorum. The holders of a majority in interest of all stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote at a meeting, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes properly cast upon the
question, whether or not a quorum is present. The stockholders present at a duly constituted meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to reduce the voting shares below a quorum.

(e) Voting and Proxies. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or by law, each stockholder entitled to vote at any
meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in
question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting

may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by either written proxy or by a transmission permitted by Section 212(c) of the
DGCL, but no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period or is irrevocable and
coupled with an interest. Proxies shall be filed with the Secretary of the meeting, or of any adjournment thereof. Except as otherwise limited therein,
proxies shall entitle the persons authorized thereby to vote at any adjournment of such meeting.

(f) Action at Meeting. When a quorum is present, any matter before the meeting shall be decided by vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares of stock voting on such matter except where a larger vote is required by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws. Any election
of directors by stockholders shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast, except where a larger vote is required by law, by the Certificate of
Incorporation or by these By-laws. The Corporation shall not directly or indirectly vote any share of its own stock; provided, however, that the
Corporation may vote shares which it holds in a fiduciary capacity to the extent permitted by law.

(g) Presiding Officer. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if one is elected, or in his or her
absence, the Vice Chairman of the Board, if one is elected, or if neither is elected or in their absence, a President. The Board of Directors shall have the
authority to appoint a temporary presiding officer to serve at any meeting of the stockholders if the Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairman of the
Board or a President is unable to do so for any reason.

(h) Conduct of Meetings. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of
stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the
presiding officer of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such
acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted
by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the presiding officer of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of
an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present;
(iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted
proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the
commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the
Board of Directors or the presiding officer of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of
parliamentary procedure.

(i) Action without a Meeting. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted by law to be
taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents
in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office, by hand or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or to the Corporation’s principal
place of business or to the officer of the Corporation having custody of the minute book. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature and no
written consent shall be effective unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered pursuant to these By-laws, written consents signed
by a sufficient number of stockholders entitled to take action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner set forth in these By-laws. Prompt notice of
the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented
in writing.

(j) Stockholder Lists. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before
every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address
of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing contained in this Section 1(j) shall require the
Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list

2. Directors

(a) Powers. The business of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors who may exercise all the

(d) Tenure. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws, directors shall hold office until

majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors.

(f) Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time, date and place as the Board of Directors
may from time to time determine. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called, orally or in writing, by the Chief Executive Officer, if one
is elected, or, if there is no Chief Executive Officer, the President, or by two or more Directors, designating the time, date and place thereof. Directors
may participate in meetings of the Board of Directors by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all
directors participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting in accordance herewith shall constitute presence in person at
such meeting.

(g) Notice of Meetings. Notice of the time, date and place of all special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be given to each director by
the Secretary, or Assistant Secretary, or in case of the death, absence, incapacity or refusal of such persons, by the officer or one of the directors calling

business or home address at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the meeting.

transaction of business. Less than a quorum may adjourn any meeting from time to time and the meeting may be held as adjourned without further
notice.

(i) Action at Meeting. At any meeting of the Board of Directors at which a quorum is present, unless otherwise provided in the following
sentence, a majority of the directors present may take any action on behalf of the Board of Directors, unless a larger number is required by law, by the
Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-laws. So long as there are two (2) or fewer Directors, any action to be taken by the Board of Directors shall
require the approval of all Directors.

Table of Contents

(j) Action by Consent. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a
meeting if all members of the Board of Directors consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic
transmission or transmissions are filed with the records of the meetings of the Board of Directors. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are
maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.

(k) Committees. The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, establish one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more directors. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of
any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of
a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members
constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or
disqualified member.

Any such committee, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may
exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the

following: (i) approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by the DGCL to be submitted to
stockholders for approval or (ii) adopting, amending or repealing any provision of these By-laws.

Except as the Board of Directors may otherwise determine, any such committee may make rules for the conduct of its business, but in the absence
of such rules its business shall be conducted so far as possible in the same manner as is provided in these By-laws for the Board of Directors. All
members of such committees shall hold their committee offices at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, and the Board may abolish any committee at

or its transfer agent may reasonably require.

distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of
any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date on which it is established, and which
shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, more than ten (10) days after the date on which the record
date for stockholder consent without a meeting is established, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. In such case only stockholders of

relating thereto.

6. Miscellaneous Provisions

each year.

(b) Seal. The Board of Directors shall have power to adopt and alter the seal of the Corporation.

(c) Execution of Instruments. Subject to any limitations which may be set forth in a resolution of the Board of Directors, all deeds, leases,
transfers, contracts, bonds, notes and other obligations to be entered into by the Corporation in the ordinary course of its business without director action
may be executed on behalf of the Corporation by, a President, or by any other officer, employee or agent of the Corporation as the Board of Directors
may authorize.

(d) Voting of Securities. Unless the Board of Directors otherwise provides, a President, any Vice President or the Treasurer or the Secretary
may waive notice of and act on behalf of this Corporation, or appoint another person or persons to act as proxy or attorney in fact for this Corporation
with or without discretionary power and/or power of substitution, at any meeting of stockholders or shareholders of any other corporation or
organization, any of whose securities are held by this Corporation.

(e) Resident Agent. The Board of Directors may appoint a resident agent upon whom legal process may be served in any action or
proceeding against the Corporation.

(f) Corporate Records. The original or attested copies of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and records of all meetings of the

addresses and the amount of stock held by each, shall be kept at the principal office of the Corporation, at the office of its counsel, or at an office of its
transfer agent.

(g) Certificate of Incorporation. All references in these By-laws to the Certificate of Incorporation shall be deemed to refer to the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended and in effect from time to time.

(h) Amendments. The By-laws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the
Corporation may, in its Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal the By-laws upon the directors. The fact that such power
has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal By-laws.

(i) Waiver of Notice. Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of these By-laws, a written waiver, signed by the person
entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is
to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when
the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting
is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting needs to be specified in any written waiver
or any waiver by electronic transmission.

Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the
Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the
Corporation or the corporation’s stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, or (d) any action asserting
a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the
Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Section 6(j).

1.2 Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries will retain and
will not transfer to the Buyer any assets and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries other than the Purchased Assets, including those assets and
properties set forth on Schedule 1.2 (the “Excluded Assets”).

1.3 Assumed Liabilities. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing the Buyer shall (or shall cause the
applicable Designated Buyer Entity to) assume, and following the Closing the Buyer shall pay, perform and discharge as they become due, all of the
liabilities and obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent arising out of or relating to the Purchased Assets (or to which any Purchased
Asset is subject), including (a) all commitments and obligations to fund or advance additional amounts with respect to such Purchased Assets, (b) all
duties, liabilities, commitments and obligations arising under or relating to any documentation included in or evidencing the Purchased Assets
(including any Definitive Agreements and any other loan and credit agreements, securitization agreements, note purchase agreements, security
agreements and all modifications, waivers and consents relating to any of the foregoing) and (c) all duties, liabilities and obligations arising out of or
relating to the origination, acquisition, ownership, participation, warehousing, sale, assignment, conveyance, servicing or collection (including the
exercise or failure to exercise any remedies at law, in equity, under contract or otherwise) of the Purchased Assets by the Company or its Subsidiaries (or
their respective predecessors), in each case of this Section 1.3, whether arising before or after the Closing and whether known or unknown, asserted or
unasserted, at the time of the Closing other than those arising in the Company’s or any applicable Subsidiary’s role as the administrative agent, collateral
agent or similar loan agent in respect thereof (which are not required to be assumed) (such assumed liabilities, collectively, the “Assumed Liabilities”).
Except as otherwise agreed by the Buyer and Parent, all liabilities and obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are not Assumed
Liabilities shall be retained by the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries (the “Retained Liabilities”). The “Retained Liabilities” shall include all
liabilities and obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries arising out of, relating to or incurred in connection with (i) any (A) current indebtedness
for borrowed money of the Company or any Subsidiary (including any Purchased Entity and including NewStar Commercial Loan Funding 2014-1
LLC’s indebtedness under the 2014-1 CLO Transaction) or any current obligations evidenced by bonds, notes, debentures or letters of credit of the
Company or any Subsidiary (it being understood that the Non-Call Period Subsidiaries will continue to owe the Non-Call Period Subsidiary Existing
Debt after giving effect to the Closing) and (B) obligations relating to any former indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or obligations
relating to any former bonds, notes, debentures or letters of credit of the Company of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any securities issued by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any securities included in the Purchased Assets pursuant to Section 1.1), (iii) any claims, rights or benefits of any

applicable Law (other than arising from the origination, acquisition, ownership, participation, warehousing, sale, assignment, conveyance, servicing or
collection of the Purchased Assets), (vi) any violation or breach (or alleged violation or breach) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any
Contract (other than the Contracts included in the Purchased Assets) and (vii) any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than the
Purchased Assets.

1.4 Non-Assignable Purchased Investments. If at the Closing an attempted assignment or transfer (whether by operation of law or otherwise) of
any Purchased Investment, or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, that, without the consent of a third party
(including any Governmental Entity) that has not been obtained, would be ineffective, would constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or a
violation of Law, or would put any of the Company or any Subsidiary in default of any Contracts (each a “Non-Assignable Purchased Investment”), then
the Closing shall occur with respect to the Purchased Investments as to which the assignment or transfer can be made without consent and, with respect
to each of the Non-Assignable Purchased Investments, the Company, the Company’s Subsidiaries, the Buyer and the Buyer’s Subsidiaries shall enter
into a Participation Agreement under which Buyer (or the applicable Designated Buyer Entity) would, in compliance with Law, obtain the benefits and
assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens associated

with such Non-Assignable Purchased Investment in accordance with this Agreement, including, to the extent permitted, with respect to any Definitive
Agreement related to such Non-Assignable Purchased Investment (and subject to the limitations, if any, contained in such Definitive Agreement), by
transferring at the Closing a participation interest or sub-participation interest in the financing arrangement contemplated by such Definitive Agreement,
and otherwise on terms reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Company. For the avoidance of doubt, any asset, claim, right or benefit subject to a
Participation Agreement shall be a Purchased Asset for all purposes under this Agreement. For each Non-Assignable Purchased Investment, Company
will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its commercially reasonable efforts during the one hundred and twenty (120) day period immediately
following the Closing Date to arrange for the transfer or assignment of such Non-Assignable Purchased Investment to Buyer or the applicable
Designated Buyer Entity. If any party discovers, within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, that there were assets of the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries that constitute Purchased Assets in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, but that were not so transferred, the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall promptly assign and transfer to the Buyer or the applicable Designated Buyer Entity all of their right,
title and interest in and to such assets at the sole cost and expense of Buyer. If any party discovers, within one hundred and twenty (120) days following
the Closing Date, that there were assets of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries that do not constitute Purchased Assets in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, but that were so transferred, the Buyer or the applicable Subsidiary shall promptly assign and transfer to the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary all of their right, title and interest in and to such assets at the sole cost and expense of the Company. In furtherance of the foregoing, not less
than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer (i) an updated Purchased Investments Tape as of
the close of business on the Closing Date, (ii) a report of any loans or actions with respect to the assets and liabilities reflected on such Purchased
Investments Tape that did not comply with Section 5.1 and (iii) a reconciliation of all loans and other investments set forth on such Purchased
Investments Tape to the Signing Date Investments, including reasonably detailed information regarding the sources and uses of any Signing Date
Investments that were liquidated or reinvested prior to the Closing Date.

1.5 Designated Buyer Entities. Buyer shall have the right to designate that all or any portion of the Purchased Assets will be purchased by one or
more Designated Buyer Entities and that all or a portion of the Assumed Liabilities will be assumed by one or more Designated Buyer Entities by
making such designations in writing to the Company at any time prior to the third (3rd) Business Day prior to Closing (in each case so long the
jurisdiction (or type) of such Designated Buyer Entity would not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the transfer of such portion of the Purchased
Assets to such Designated Buyer Entity at the Closing, including as a result of an inability to obtained required opinion letters related to Tax matters
with respect to such transfer as contemplated by Section 2.3(a)(ix)). The Company agrees that it will comply with any such designations received by
Buyer pursuant to this Section 1.5. No transfer of property by Buyer is being made and no obligation by Buyer is being incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of any of Buyer and its Subsidiaries,
including the Company and its Subsidiaries. In connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer has not incurred, nor plans to incur, debts
beyond its ability to pay as they become absolute and matured.

ARTICLE II.
CLOSING AND PURCHASE PRICE

2.1 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the “Closing”)
shall take place, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties, at the offices of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, 425
Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time on the date that is the third (3rd) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions (other than those conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction of such conditions at the Closing) set forth in Article VI. The date on which the Closing occurs is the “Closing Date”.

2.2 Purchase Price.

(a) At the Closing, as consideration for the Purchased Assets, the Buyer shall pay to the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, $2,370,700,000, (i) plus, if the Estimated Adjustment Amount is a positive number, the Estimated Adjustment Amount or (ii) minus, if the
Estimated Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the absolute value of the Estimated Adjustment Amount (collectively, the “Closing Purchase Price”
and as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2(c), the “Purchase Price”) and Buyer or the Designated Buyer Entities shall assume the Assumed Liabilities. For
the avoidance of doubt, at Closing Buyer may direct that any of the funds remaining in the Deposit Account be transferred to the Company in partial
satisfaction of the Purchase Price, and the amount of any funds so transferred to the Company will reduce the wire transfer the Buyer is required to make
to the Company pursuant to this Section 2.2(a).

(b) Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a written
statement, together with reasonable supporting documentation, setting forth a good faith estimate of (i) the amount of the Interest Receivable as of the
close of business on the anticipated Closing Date, (ii) the amount of the Unused Fees as of the close of business on the anticipated Closing Date, (iii) the
amount of the Other Assets as of the close of business on the anticipated Closing Date and (iv) the Net Cash Amount (the sum of (i) through (iii), minus
(iv), the “Estimated Adjustment Amount”), in each case prepared in a manner consistent with the principles (the “Accounting Principles”) used in the
preparation of the Signing Interest Receivable and Signing Unused Fees set forth on Schedule A of the Company Disclosure Letter and, in the case of
the Net Cash Amount, in a manner consistent with the principles used in the preparation of Schedule A of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Buyer
shall have the right to review the Company’s statement of the Estimated Adjustment Amount, and the Company shall give Buyer reasonable access to
the Company’s books and records and personnel in connection with such review and shall consider in good faith any proposed changes of Buyer thereto.
To the extent the Company and Buyer agree to any changes to the Company’s original written statement of the Estimated Adjustment Amount, such
modifications shall be incorporated by the Company and the Estimated Adjustment Amount shall be revised accordingly; provided that if the Company
and Buyer are not able to reach mutual agreement prior to the Closing Date, the Estimated Adjustment Amount provided by the Company to Buyer, as
modified to include any changes agreed to by the Company and Buyer, shall be the Estimated Adjustment Amount for purposes of this Section 2.2 and
otherwise in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Estimated Adjustment Amount may be a negative number.

(c) No later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after all “Payment Dates” for the first quarter of 2018 have occurred with respect to the Other
Assets, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a written statement (the “Preliminary Adjustment Statement”) setting forth in reasonable detail the
Company’s calculation of the amount of Interest Receivable, Unused Fees, Other Assets and Net Cash Amount, in each case as of the close of business
on the Closing Date in accordance with the Accounting Principles. Following the Closing and prior to the delivery of the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement the Company shall, from time to time, provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to review drafts of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
and the Company’s calculations with respect thereto, and the Company and the Buyer will cooperate in good faith in connection with the preparation of
the Preliminary Adjustment Statement. Following receipt of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, if Buyer has any objections to such document as
prepared by the Company, Buyer shall deliver written notice to the Company of such dispute within ten (10) Business Days after the date of such receipt
thereof (the “Dispute Notice”) setting forth in reasonable detail the item or amount in the Preliminary Adjustment Statement disputed by Buyer and the
basis for such dispute, including Buyer’s calculation of any relevant amounts. Buyer shall only be entitled to dispute amounts set forth in the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement to the extent that such amounts (i) were not prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles or (ii) contain a
mathematical or other clerical error. In the event that Buyer does not deliver a Dispute Notice within such ten (10) Business Day period, the applicable
amount of the Interest Receivable, Unused Fees, Other Assets and Net Cash Amount set forth in the Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall be final
and binding as the “Final Interest Receivable,” “Final Unused Fees,” “Final Other Assets” and “Final Net Cash Amount for purposes of this Agreement.
In the event such Dispute Notice is delivered, any item or amount to which no dispute is raised in the

Dispute Notice shall be final and binding on the parties and the Company and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve Buyer’s objections. Any
objections so resolved by the Company and the Buyer shall be final and binding on the parties. If the Buyer and the Company, notwithstanding such
good faith efforts, fail to resolve all such objections within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, then the Buyer and the Company
shall jointly engage an independent third-party national accounting firm (the “Accountants”) to conduct a special review of Buyer’s objections to the
Interest Receivable, Unused Fees, Other Assets or Net Cash Amount, as applicable, set forth in the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (such review to be completed no later than twenty (20) days after the Accountants are requested to conduct such special review).
The Accountants shall review only those items identified by the parties as being in dispute. Upon completion of such review, the Accountants shall
deliver written notice to the Company and Buyer setting forth the Accountants’ resolution of such objections and the resulting adjustments shall be
deemed finally determined for purposes of this Section 2.2; provided, however, that each resolution of a disputed item by the Accountants must be
within the range of differences between the Buyer’s and the Company’s positions with respect to such disputed item. The Accountants’ role in
completing such review shall be limited to resolving such objections and determining the correct calculations to be used with respect to only the
disputed portions of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement. In resolving such objections, the Accountants shall apply the provisions of this Agreement
concerning determination of the amounts set forth in the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, and the decision of the Accountants shall be solely based on
(i) whether such item objected to was prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles or (ii) whether the item objected to contains a
mathematical or other clerical error. Any dispute as to the interpretation or construction of this Agreement shall not be resolved by the Accountants and
instead shall be resolved pursuant to the general dispute resolution provisions contained in this Agreement. In resolving any objections, the Accountants
shall act as accounting experts only and not as arbitrators. The amount of the Interest Receivable, Unused Fees and Other Assets as agreed by the Buyer
and the Company or as determined by the Accountants, as the case may be, shall be final and binding as the “Final Interest Receivable,” “Final Unused
Fees,” “Final Other Assets” and “Final Net Cash Amount” for purposes of this Agreement. The parties hereto shall make available to the Accountants
(if applicable), such books, records and other information (including work papers) that the Accountants may reasonably request in order to review the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the Dispute Notice. The fees and expenses of the Accountants hereunder shall be paid by the Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the
amount actually contested by or on behalf of such party. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will the Final Net Cash Amount be less
than the Lower Limit Amount.

(d) Promptly (but not later than two (2) Business Days) after the determination of the Final Interest Receivable, Final Unused Fees, Final
Other Assets and Final Net Cash Amount:

(i) if (A) the sum of the Final Interest Receivable, Final Unused Fees and Final Other Assets, minus (B) the Final Net Cash Amount is
greater than the Estimated Adjustment Amount, Buyer shall pay to the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
amount of such difference;

(ii) if the Estimated Adjustment Amount is greater than (A) the sum of the Final Interest Receivable, Final Unused Fees and Final
Other Assets, minus (B) the Final Net Cash Amount, the Company shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
amount of such difference; and

(iii) if the Estimated Adjustment Amount is equal to (A) the sum of the Final Interest Receivable, Final Unused Fees and Final Other
Assets, minus (B) the Final Net Cash Amount, no payments shall be made by the parties pursuant to this Section 2.2(d).

only if:

(i) the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (including an Acquisition Proposal from an Excluded Party)
that was not solicited in breach of this Section 5.5 that the Company’s Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company has materially complied with the other provisions of this
Section 5.5 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) the Company’s Board of Directors has determined in good faith that the failure to so terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 7.1(g) and/or make such Change in Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

(iii) the Company delivers to the Buyer and Parent a written notice (a “Superior Proposal Notice”) advising the Buyer and Parent that

Company Recommendation other than in response to or in respect of an Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal if and only if:

(i) the Company’s Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law as a result of any event, fact, circumstances, development or
occurrence relating to or affecting the Company or its Subsidiaries, including the business, operations, assets or liabilities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and which was not known by or reasonably foreseeable to the Company’s Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) as of the date
of this Agreement (an “Intervening Event”); provided, however, that in no event shall any action taken by the Company in order to comply with
the covenants set forth in this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, and the consequences of any such action, constitute an Intervening Event;

(ii) the Company delivers to the Buyer and Parent a written notice (an “Intervening Event Notice”) advising the Buyer and Parent that
the Company’s Board of Directors proposes to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, which notice shall include a description of the

consultation with its outside counsel, and taking into account any modifications to this Agreement and the Merger Agreement proposed by the
Buyer and Parent prior to such time) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

In the event that the Company delivers Buyer a Superior Proposal Notice or Intervening Event Notice, the Company shall have been deemed to have
automatically waived any standstill to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party solely for the limited purpose of permitting Buyer to negotiate with
the Company in accordance with clause (g) or (h) above, as applicable.

(i) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), (ii) making a customary “stop-look-and-listen”
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of the Company) or (iii) making any legally required disclosure to stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that in each case of (i), (ii) and (iii), the Company expressly publicly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation in such disclosure and does not include any statement that itself would be a Change in Company Recommendation.

Proposal, all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to “twenty percent (20%) or more” will be deemed to be references to “fifty
percent (50%) or more”) which the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside counsel, is reasonably likely to be consummated and would result, if consummated, in a transaction that is more favorable to the
stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent and the Buyer in response to such Superior Proposal pursuant to,

5.6 Advice of Changes. The Buyer and the Company shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event of which it becomes aware
which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to prevent the satisfaction of any condition to closing set forth in Article VI hereof; provided,
however, that any noncompliance with this Section 5.6 shall not be taken into account in determining whether the condition set forth in Section 6.2(b) or
Section 6.3(b) has been satisfied or give rise to any right of termination under Article VII.

5.7 Publicity. The Buyer and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to this Agreement and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement (other than in the case of the Company, a Change in Company Recommendation and
related public statements or any other statements contemplated by Section 5.5(i)) without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior
consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances) issue such press release or make such public statement as may, upon the advice of outside
counsel, be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any applicable securities exchange. The Buyer and the Company agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement shall be a joint press release in the form
agreed to by the Company, the Buyer and Parent.

(h) by the Company, by written notice to the Buyer, if (i) all of the conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 have been satisfied or waived
by the Buyer (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; provided, that such conditions are capable of being
satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the date of delivery by the Company of notice under this Section 7.1(h)), (ii) on the date the Closing should

except that (i) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement, (ii) this Section 7.2 and Article VIII shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and (iii) subject to Section 7.2(h), a party shall not be relieved or released from any Liabilities or damages arising out of

breach that is a consequence of an act or failure to act undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to act
would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement; provided, that a failure by the Buyer to consummate the Closing if the
Debt Financing is not available shall not be a “willful and material breach.”

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (A) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d) (other than such termination resulting from a breach of
the representations and warranties in Section 4.11), Section 7.1(h) or Section 7.1(i)(A) or (B) by the Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(c) in a circumstance
where the Company could have terminated the Agreement pursuant to one or more of the sections referenced in clause (A) above in accordance with its
terms at the time of such termination by Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(c), the Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, $25 million (the “Buyer Termination Fee”) no later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination. The
Buyer Termination Fee shall be paid by the release of funds held in the Deposit Account to the Company (provided if this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1(i), the Company shall retain all rights and remedies against the Buyer under this Agreement and against the Fund, the feeder
funds thereof, the Equity Investors and the general partner of the Fund under the Limited Guarantee and Draw-Down Rights Assignment Agreement in
order to obtain payment of the Buyer Termination Fee).

(c) The Company shall pay the Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to $7 million (the “Go Shop
Termination Fee”) if (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(g) to enter into a definitive agreement to effect a Superior

delivered to Buyer no later than the date that is fourteen days after the No-Shop Period Start Date or (ii) this Agreement is terminated under

Termination Fee (as defined in the Merger Agreement) was payable to Parent under Section 7.2(b) therein; provided further that in the case of clauses
(i) and (ii), the payment of the Go Shop Termination Fee shall be made concurrently with or prior to such termination of this Agreement.

(d) The Company shall pay the Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to $10.5 million (the “Termination
Fee”) if (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(f), which payment shall be made within two (2) Business Days of the date
of such termination, (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(g) in a circumstance in which the Go Shop Termination
Fee is not payable or (iii) this Agreement is terminated under Section 7.1(j) after the Merger Agreement had been terminated under Section 7.1(f) or
Section 7.1(g) of the Merger Agreement in a circumstance in which the Termination Fee (as defined in the Merger Agreement) was payable to Parent
under Section 7.2(c) therein; provided further that in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) the payment of the Termination Fee shall be made concurrently with
or prior to such termination of this Agreement.

(e) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by (A) either the Buyer or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(e), (B) by either the Buyer or the
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c), (C) by the Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(d) or (D) by either the Buyer or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(j)
after the Merger Agreement had been terminated (x) by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.1(e) of the Merger Agreement or
(y) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d) of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) (x) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company (but not
publicly announced) and such Acquisition Proposal has not been unconditionally withdraw prior to the termination of this Agreement or (y) an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement and
(iii) within twelve (12) months after such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall pay the Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Termination Fee on or
before the second (2nd) Business Day after the date such Acquisition Proposal is consummated. For purposes of this Section 7.2(e), all references to
“twenty percent (20%) or more” in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall instead refer to “fifty percent (50%) or more”.

(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall (i) the Company be required to pay both the Go Shop Termination Fee and the
Termination Fee, it being understood and agreed that only one payment of either the Go Shop Termination Fee or the Termination Fee shall ever be
payable hereunder and (ii) the Buyer be required to pay the Buyer Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(g) The Company and the Buyer agree that the agreements contained in Section 7.2 are integral parts of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that none of the Buyer Termination Fee, the Go Shop Termination Fee or the Termination Fee shall constitute a penalty but are
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. If, in
order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit against the Buyer, or the Buyer commencing a suit against the Company, that results in a
judgment for the payment of the Buyer Termination Fee or for the payment of the Go Shop Termination Fee or Termination Fee, as applicable, the
Buyer or the Company, as applicable, shall also be required to pay to the other party interest on the termination fee that was so payable at the annual rate
equal to the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made, through the date such
payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law (“Interest Expense”). Any Interest Expense to be
paid to the Company shall be paid by the release of funds held in the Deposit Account to the Company.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Buyer breaches this Agreement or fails to perform any of its
covenants, obligations or agreements hereunder (whether such breach or failure is willful and material, unintentional or otherwise), the sole and
exclusive remedies (whether such remedies are sought in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company against the Buyer for any
losses, damages, costs, expenses, obligations or liabilities arising out of or related to this Agreement (or any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, obligation or agreement contained in this Agreement), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any failure of such transactions to
be consummated), the Commitment Letters and the financings contemplated therein (or any failure of such financings to be consummated) shall be
(i) prior to termination of this Agreement, the right to obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with the terms
and subject to the limitations of Section 8.14; and (ii) the Company’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 and (x) receive
(A) the Buyer Termination Fee (and any Interest Expense) in the circumstances under which such fee is payable pursuant to Section 7.2(b) and (B) all
reimbursement and indemnification payments obligated to be paid pursuant to Section 5.13 and (y) if this Agreement has been terminated in
circumstances in which the Buyer Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to Section 7.2(b) and there has been a willful and material breach of this
Agreement by Buyer, seek money damages from the Buyer with respect to any of Buyer’s willful and material breaches of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the Buyer have any monetary liability or obligations in excess of an amount equal to (1) the amount of the Buyer Termination Fee plus (2) all
reimbursement and indemnification payments obligated to be paid pursuant to Section 5.13. While the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with Section 8.14 and the payment of the Buyer Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the Closing occurring and the Buyer Termination Fee.

(i) The Buyer agrees that upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Go Shop Termination Fee or Termination
Fee, as applicable, is payable by the Company pursuant to this Section 7.2, the Buyer shall be precluded from any remedy against the Company, at law
or in equity or otherwise other than payment by the Company to the Buyer of such Go Shop Termination Fee or Termination Fee if and when payable
hereunder (together with any interest thereon), and neither Buyer nor any of its affiliates shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any
kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, other Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby).

(j) In the event this Agreement is terminated in circumstances in which the Buyer Termination Fee is not payable, then all funds in the
Deposit Account shall be released (and the Buyer and the Company shall cause such release) to the Buyer or its designee promptly after the termination
of this Agreement. In all other circumstances, once the Depositary Bank has disbursed to the Company the funds to which it is entitled under this
Agreement, the Company shall instruct the Depositary Bank to release any remaining funds to Buyer (or its designee). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 7.2(j), (i) if this Agreement is terminated in circumstances in which a Buyer Termination Fee is not payable but the Company
believes in good faith it is entitled to monetary damages from the Buyer in respect of a willful and material breach of this Agreement by the Buyer,
(ii) the Company notifies Buyer in writing of its belief that Buyer has willfully and materially breached this Agreement and as a result the Company is
entitled to monetary damages pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (which notice includes a reasonably detailed description of such breach) within
seven (7) days of the date of termination of this Agreement and (iii) the Company institutes a lawsuit against Buyer in respect of such willful and
material breach within thirty (30) days of the termination of this Agreement for such damages, the Buyer shall not withdraw the Buyer Termination Fee
from the Deposit Account until the resolution of such lawsuit pursuant to a final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction or written settlement
agreement between the Buyer and the Company. Upon such resolution, the Buyer and the Company shall (and the Buyer shall cause the Fund to) take
such actions as to release the funds in the Deposit Account in accordance with such resolution.

EXHIBIT B

ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION1

This Assignment and Assumption (the “Assignment and Assumption”) is dated as of the Effective Date set forth below and is entered into by and
between [the][each]2 Assignor identified in item 1 below ([the][each, an] “Assignor”) and [the][each]3 Assignee identified in item 2 below ([the][each,
an] “Assignee”). [It is understood and agreed that the rights and obligations of [the Assignors][the Assignees]4 hereunder are several and not joint.]5
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement identified below (as amended, the “Credit
Agreement”), receipt of a copy of which is hereby acknowledged by [the][each] Assignee. The Standard Terms and Conditions set forth in Annex 1
attached hereto are hereby agreed to and incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Assignment and Assumption as if set forth herein in
full.

For an agreed consideration, [the][each] Assignor hereby irrevocably sells and assigns to [the Assignee][the respective Assignees], and [the][each]
Assignee hereby irrevocably purchases and assumes from [the Assignor][the respective Assignors], subject to and in accordance with the Standard
Terms and Conditions and the Credit Agreement, as of the Effective Date inserted by the Administrative Agent as contemplated below (i) all of [the
Assignor’s][the respective Assignors’] rights and obligations in [its capacity as a Lender][their respective capacities as Lenders] under the Credit
Agreement and any other documents or instruments delivered pursuant thereto to the extent related to the amount and percentage interest identified
below of all of such outstanding rights and obligations of [the Assignor][the respective Assignors] under the respective facilities identified below
(including without limitation any letters of credit, guarantees, and swingline loans included in such facilities), and (ii) to the extent permitted to be
assigned under applicable law, all claims, suits, causes of action and any other right of [the Assignor (in its capacity as a Lender)][the respective
Assignors (in their respective capacities as Lenders)] against any Person, whether known or unknown, arising under or in connection with the Credit
Agreement, any other documents or instruments delivered pursuant thereto or the loan transactions governed thereby or in any way based on or related
to any of the foregoing, including, but not limited to, contract claims, tort claims, malpractice claims, statutory claims and all other claims at law or in
equity related to the rights and obligations sold and assigned pursuant to clause (i) above (the rights and obligations sold and assigned by [the][any]
Assignor to [the][any] Assignee pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above being referred to herein collectively as [the][an] “Assigned Interest”). Each such
sale and assignment is without recourse to [the][any] Assignor and, except as expressly provided in this Assignment and Assumption, without
representation or warranty by [the][any] Assignor.

2.  Assignee[s]:                 

       
  [Assignee is an [Affiliate][Approved Fund] of [identify Lender]

 
1 The LSTA’s Form of Assignment Agreement has been drafted so that parties need not tailor the agreement depending on the identity of each

assignee. In this way, electronic settlement platforms do not need to create “pop-ups”, ie, questions which appear or “pop-up” on the screen of the
person completing the assignment agreement and which must be answered before the assignment agreement can be populated and finalised. By
avoiding “pop-ups”, the loan market can operate more efficiently, for trades will be able to settle more promptly.

2 For bracketed language here and elsewhere in this form relating to the Assignor(s), if the assignment is from a single Assignor, choose the first
bracketed language. If the assignment is from multiple Assignors, choose the second bracketed language.

3 For bracketed language here and elsewhere in this form relating to the Assignee(s), if the assignment is to a single Assignee, choose the first
bracketed language. If the assignment is to multiple Assignees, choose the second bracketed language.

4 Select as appropriate.
5 Include bracketed language if there are either multiple Assignors or multiple Assignees.

Seller acknowledges that each sale of a Participation to Buyer is a true and irrevocable sale.

 
5. Buyer’s Representations and Warranties; Acknowledgment

5.1 Buyer represents and warrants to Seller as of the Closing Date that:

(a) No contribution or payment to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement will cause Seller to be in violation of the United States Bank Secrecy Act, the
United States Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, the United States International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act
of 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (“Patriot Act”) of

(nor, to Buyer’s knowledge, are any of its directors, officers or agents) a person or entity subject to economic sanctions administered by OFAC.

(b) With respect to each Participation, Buyer has independently and without reliance upon any Seller, and based on such information as Buyer has
deemed appropriate, made its own analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement, except that Buyer has relied upon Seller’s express representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements and indemnities in this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that Seller has not given Buyer any investment advice, credit
information or opinion on whether the purchase of any Participation is prudent.

5.2 Buyer acknowledges that Seller’s sale of each Participation to Buyer and Buyer’s agreement to reimburse Seller in respect of the Assumed
Obligations relating to such Participation are irrevocable.

 
6. Indemnification; Limitation of Liability

Buyer’s representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement or (b) Seller’s acting or refraining to act pursuant to any direction of
Buyer in accordance with this Agreement, in each case, within ten (10) Business Days after the Seller’s written demand therefor.

6.3 If a third party commences any action or makes any demand against either Party for which such Party (the “Indemnified Party”) is entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the other Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) of such action or
demand; provided, however, that if the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the action and fails to provide prompt notice to the Indemnifying Party,
such failure shall not limit in any way the Indemnifying Party’s obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party except to the extent that such failure
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend the action. The Indemnifying Party may, at its own expense and without limiting its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party, participate in the defense of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, or
the Indemnifying Party may, at its own expense and without limiting its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party, assume the defense of such
action with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In any event, the Party that has assumed the defense of such action shall provide the
other Party with copies of all notices, pleadings, and other papers filed or served in such action. Neither Party shall make any settlement or adjustment
without the other Party’s prior consent, which consent (a) in the case of the Indemnifying Party will not be unreasonably withheld if the settlement or
adjustment involves only the payment of money damages by the Indemnifying Party and (b) in the case of the Indemnified Party may be withheld for
any reason if the settlement or adjustment involves performance or admission by the Indemnified Party. Nothing herein shall give an Indemnifying Party
access to information, or contest rights related to, the income tax returns of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates.

6.4 Each indemnity in this Agreement is a continuing obligation, separate and independent from the other obligations of the Parties and survives
termination of this Agreement or any transfer pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement. It is not necessary for a Party to incur expense or make payment
before enforcing a right of indemnity conferred by this Agreement.

 
6A. Alternative Arrangements

6A.1 In the event that (i) Transferred Rights with respect to any Participation or purported Participation do not contain all of the rights of Seller
that would constitute Transferred Rights under the definition of “Transferred Rights” if participation of such rights were permitted under the terms and
provisions of the related Credit Documents and applicable Law (collectively, “Full Transferred Rights”), (ii) Seller has not obtained all Participation
Required Consents with respect to any Participation or purported Participation or (iii) any third party claims the occurrence of any event under clauses
(i) and (ii) above, then Seller will enter into an arrangement under which Buyer would, in compliance with Law, obtain the benefits and assume the
obligations and bear the economic burdens that would be associated with such Full Transferred Rights in accordance with this Agreement (any such
arrangement, an “Alternative Arrangement”). Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence, such Alternative Arrangement will include entering
into an arrangement under which (i) Seller would enforce for the benefit (and at the expense) of Buyer any and all of its rights against a third party
(including any Governmental Authority) associated with the affected Full Transferred Rights, (ii) Seller would promptly pay to Buyer when received all
monies received by it after the Closing (as defined in the APA) with respect to the affected Full Transferred Rights and (iii) Buyer would perform or
cause to be performed (at its expense) all of Seller’s obligations under the affected Full Transferred Rights. Simultaneously with the entry into an
Alternative Arrangement with respect to any Participation or purported Participation, such Participation or purported Participation shall be deemed
released and extinguished to the extent of such Alternative Arrangement.

Seller that shall have paid such amounts, reimburse Seller for the full

amount paid on such other Party’s behalf. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 7.1 shall relieve Buyer of its obligations to fund and pay
when payable and due any Assumed Obligations.

7.2 Buyer shall reimburse Seller, promptly upon invoice thereof from Seller, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses and
disbursements (including reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by Seller in connection with the Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereunder, including in connection with any Elevation, any consent required for such Elevation to the extent arising after the
Closing Date, the Transferred Rights, the Credit Documents or any related documents and any effort to enforce or protect Seller’s or Buyer’s rights or
interests thereunder, in each case to the extent not previously reimbursed to Seller by the applicable Borrower. Seller shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to notify Buyer from time to time of any expenses or disbursements incurred by Seller (including the amount and purpose of such expenses and
disbursements) as to which Seller expects it may seek reimbursement from Buyer under this Section 7.2, provided that the failure to do so shall not limit
Buyer’s reimbursement obligations hereunder.

 
8. Distributions; Interest and Fees; Payments; Funding Obligations; Commitment Reductions

8.1 (a) If at any time on and after the Closing Date Seller received or receives a Distribution relating to a Participation:

(i) Seller shall accept and, from and after the Closing Date, hold, in a segregated account, such Distribution for the account and sole benefit
of Buyer (it being understood that Distributions with respect to all Participations may be maintained in a single segregated account for the
account of Buyer),

(ii) Buyer shall be the sole holder of the equitable and beneficial ownership interest in such Distribution, and Seller shall have no equitable
or beneficial ownership interest in or right to receive such Distribution and such Distribution shall for all purposes constitute property of
Buyer,

(iii) Seller shall deliver to Buyer such Distribution (subject to Sections 8.1(a)(iv) and 8.4, free of any withholding, setoff, recoupment, or
deduction of any kind except as required by Law) promptly (but in the case of any cash Distribution, in no event later than two (2) Business
Days after the date on which Seller receives such Distribution) in the same form received and, when necessary or appropriate, with Seller’s
endorsement (without recourse, representation, or warranty), except to the extent prohibited under any applicable Law, and

(iv) To the extent that (i) Seller receives such Distribution net of any withholding, setoff, recoupment or deduction of any kind and (ii) such
withholding, setoff, recoupment or deduction is attributable to (A) Seller’s failure to provide the relevant withholding agent with such
forms, certifications, statements and any other documents as such withholding agent may reasonably request (1) to evidence Seller’s
exemption from (or reduction in the amount of) withholding of any tax imposed by the United States of America or any other jurisdiction,
whether domestic or foreign, (2) to enable such withholding agent to comply with any applicable Law, or (3) to provide such withholding
agent with all documentation that it may reasonable request from time to time for withholding tax purposes or (B) Seller’s failure to provide
the relevant withholding agent with any documentation provided by Buyer pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 8.4, Seller shall, in
each case, deliver to Buyer the amount of such Distribution plus the amount of any such withholding, setoff, recoupment or deduction. For
the avoidance of doubt, if clause (ii) of the preceding sentence does not apply, Seller shall deliver the amount of such Distribution net of
such withholding, setoff, recoupment or deduction.

If Seller fails to pay any cash Distribution to Buyer in accordance with the time period set forth in clause (iii) of this Section 8.1(a), then Seller shall pay
interest on such payment for the period from (and including) the day on which such payment is actually received by Seller to (but excluding) the day
such payment is actually paid to Buyer.

(b) If a Distribution to be delivered to Buyer includes securities or other non-cash Distribution, Seller shall, to the extent permitted by law, endorse
(without recourse, representation or warranty) or use commercially reasonable efforts (at Buyer’s sole expense) to assist Buyer to cause to be registered
in Buyer’s name, or such name as Buyer may direct, and deliver such securities to Buyer or to such Entity as Buyer may direct as soon as practicable.
Pending such transfer, Seller shall (from and after the Closing Date) hold the same on behalf and for the sole benefit of Buyer, and Seller shall have no
equitable or beneficial interest in any such Distribution, and such Distribution shall for all purposes constitute property of Buyer.

(c) If all or any portion of a Distribution received by Seller and transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Section 8.1 is required to be returned or
disgorged by Seller to any Entity, Buyer shall promptly return such Distribution (or portion thereof) and the amount of all related Reimbursement
Claims to Seller together with all related interest and charges payable by Seller in respect thereof.

8.2 Except as provided in Sections 8.1 and 8.4, all payments made by Buyer to Seller or by Seller to Buyer under this Agreement shall be made in
the lawful currency of the United States by wire transfer of immediately available funds into the Seller Account or Buyer Account, as applicable, in
accordance with the wire instructions specified in Schedule 8.2.

8.3(a) With respect to the payment of any funds or other property under this Agreement (including the delivery of Distributions under
Section 8.1), whether from Seller to Buyer or from Buyer to Seller, the Party required to deliver a Distribution or otherwise make a payment (the
“Remitting Party”) may withhold therefrom any amount in respect of taxes required by law, including pursuant to FATCA to be withheld (a
“Withholding Tax”), and any amount so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the recipient of the payment
from which the amount was withheld (the “Receiving Party”).

(b) [Reserved.]

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.4 or Section 10.1(a), if a payment required under this Agreement or a payment under any
Transferred Rights would be subject to withholding imposed by FATCA if the Receiving Party were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting
requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable, or any applicable intergovernmental
agreement or regulation), or on account of any of the Receiving Party’s “recalcitrant account holders” within the meaning of Section 1471(d)(6) of the
Code on account of the Receiving Party’s status under FATCA, the Receiving Party shall deliver to the Remitting Party, at such time or times reasonably
requested by the Remitting Party, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code)
and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Remitting Party as may be necessary for the Remitting Party to comply with its
obligations under FATCA and to determine that the Receiving Party has complied with the Receiving Party’s obligations under FATCA or to determine
the amount required to be deducted and withheld from such payment. Each Party agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires

inability to do so.

8.4 Subject to Section 8.1(a)(iv), any taxes due and payable on any Distributions or other payments to Buyer hereunder shall be Buyer’s sole
responsibility. Not more than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, Buyer shall furnish to Seller such forms (including a properly completed IRS
Form W-9 or appropriate IRS Form W-8, as applicable), certifications, statements and any other documents as Seller may reasonably request to evidence
Buyer’s exemption from (or reduction in the amount of) withholding of any tax imposed by the United States of America or any other jurisdiction,
whether domestic or foreign, or to enable Seller to comply with any applicable Law, and to provide Seller all documentation that Seller may reasonably
request from time to time for withholding tax purposes, and Seller may refrain from remitting such Distribution or any other payments hereunder until
such forms, certifications, statements and other documents have been so furnished. In addition, Buyer shall deliver such forms, certifications, statements
and other documents promptly upon the obsolescence,

expiration or invalidity of any such item previously delivered by Buyer. Buyer agrees to hold Seller harmless from any Withholding Tax imposed due to
Buyer’s failure to establish that it is not subject to Withholding Tax. In the event that a payment to Buyer is subject to Withholding Tax and a Seller
Indemnitee is held liable for such Withholding Tax, Buyer agrees to promptly reimburse and indemnify Seller, and hold Seller harmless, for such
amount, it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that Buyer shall have no liability for, and shall not indemnify any Seller Indemnitee for, any
Withholding Taxes described in Section 8.1(a)(iv). The obligations of Buyer to pay or reimburse Seller under this Section 8.4 for any Withholding Tax
or other tax obligations shall survive the termination of this Agreement.1 Buyer agrees to pay any and all amounts owed under this Section 8.4 within
ten (10) Business Days of Buyer’s receipt of a request for payment notwithstanding termination of this Agreement.

8.5 Without limiting the generality of Section 2.1, to the extent that an Unfunded Commitment or Agent Expenses are due to be funded with
respect to any Participated Loan, or any other costs and expenses are due and payable by Buyer under this Agreement, Buyer shall:
 

 

(a) in the case of any Unfunded Commitment with respect to any Participated Loan, on the date specified in the borrowing request under the
related Credit Agreement requesting a draw by the applicable Borrower in respect of such Unfunded Commitment to the extent notice
thereof is delivered to Buyer on the same day such borrowing request is received by Seller and, otherwise, on the later of the date specified
in such borrowing request and one Business Day after delivery by Seller to Buyer of notice of such borrowing request,

 

 
(b) in the case of any Agent Expenses with respect to any Participated Loans, promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days after)

after delivery of a notice with respect thereto from the Agent with respect to Agent Expenses relating to such Participated Loan, and
 

 
(c) in the case of any other costs and expenses payable by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, within ten (10) Business Days after the Seller’s

written demand therefor,2

Buyer shall pay, fund and deliver, as applicable, the amounts required to be funded by the Buyer under this Agreement specified therein to Seller in
immediately available funds, without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind, not later than 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the Funding Date
except in the case of same day funding, in which case, not later than 12:00 p.m. New York City time.

Any such notice described above may be delivered by electronic mail or other electronic transmission (any such notice, a “Funding Notice”) and shall
include, as applicable, (i) such Unfunded Commitments, Agent Expenses, indemnification obligations or costs and expenses then due, payable or
required to be funded, as applicable; (ii) the amount with respect thereto to be funded by Buyer (the “Funding Advance”); (iii) the currency in which the
Funding Advance is to be paid; and (iv) the date (the “Funding Due Date”) on which the funds are due (which Funding Due Date shall be as provided in
clauses (a), (b) or (c) above, as applicable. The date on which funding specified in any Funding Notice is made is referred to as the “Funding Date”).

8.6 Upon the receipt of the Funding Advance with respect to an Unfunded Commitment or Agent Expenses with respect to any Participation from
Buyer on or prior to the Funding Due Date, Seller shall (i) accept and hold the Funding Advance for delivery to the applicable Agent for the benefit of
Buyer as contemplated herein, (ii) have no equitable or beneficial interest in the Funding Advance (other than for purposes of funding the Funding
Advance) and the Funding Advance shall for all purposes constitute property of Buyer, and (iii) promptly fund the Funding Advance in full, in
immediately available funds, without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind in accordance with the terms of the applicable Credit Agreement. If
after Seller receives a Funding Advance from Buyer hereunder with respect to an Unfunded Commitment or Agent Expenses with respect to any
Participation, Seller is no longer required under the Credit Documents relating to such

Participation to pay any portion of such Funding Advance to the Agent or Borrower under such Credit Documents, then Seller shall promptly refund
such portion of the Funding Advance to Buyer.

8.7 If the Funding Advance is received by Seller at any time after 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Funding Date, such Funding Advance shall
be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. Without regard to (a) the date Buyer receives the Funding Notice from Seller
and (b) Buyer’s payment of the Funding Advance, any funding by Seller of an Unfunded Commitment relating to any Participation (the “Funded Loan”)
(together with any and all rights of Seller which arise in respect thereto (including without limitation rights to repayment and all rights in, to and under
the Credit Agreement relating to such Participation)) shall be deemed to be part of the Participation under which such funding was made from and after
the time such Funded Loan is made by Seller. In the event that Buyer fails to pay any Funding Advance on the applicable Funding Date, Seller may, in
its sole discretion, charge Buyer interest at a per annum rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate from and including the time when such Funding Advance
was required to be paid hereunder to but excluding the date Buyer pays the Funding Advance to Seller or, in the case where Seller has made a Funded
Loan, from and including the time of such Funded Loan by Seller to but excluding the date Buyer pays the Funding Advance to Seller at a per annum
rate equal to the rate actually payable by the Borrower under the related Loan for the same time period. Solely as between Buyer and Seller, nothing in
this Section 8.7 or otherwise in this Agreement requires, or shall be deemed to require, Seller to fund any Commitment if Buyer has not delivered to
Seller the relevant Funding Advance when due.

8.8 Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement, Seller shall be under no obligation to bid for competitive bid loans (or similar voluntary
loan facilities, if any) on behalf of Buyer under any Credit Agreement in respect of any Commitment or otherwise.

8.9 If either Party fails to make full payment of any amount under this Agreement when due, such party shall, upon demand by the other Party,
pay such defaulted amount together with interest on it (for each day from (and including) the date when due to (but excluding) the date when actually
paid) at a rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate.

 
9. Notices; Records; Reports

9.1 All communications between the Parties in respect of, or notices, requests, directions, consents or other information sent under, this
Agreement shall be in writing, hand delivered or sent by overnight courier or electronic transmission, addressed to the relevant Party at its address,
electronic mail or facsimile number specified in Schedule 9.1 or at such other address, electronic mail or facsimile number as such Party may
subsequently request in writing. All such communications and notices shall be confidential in accordance with Section 18 and shall be effective upon
receipt.

9.2 Buyer acknowledges that over the term of the Participation, Buyer may receive from or on behalf of Seller, from time to time, material non-
public information within the meaning of the United States federal securities laws with respect to any Borrower, any Obligor or any of their respective
subsidiaries or any of their respective securities (“MNPI”) and the Seller shall have no obligation to withhold any MNPI with respect to any Borrower or
any Obligor or any of their respective subsidiaries or securities.

 
10. Further Transfers

10.1 The provisions of this Section 10.1 shall apply to any sale, assignment and any other transfer of any Participation or any of Buyer’s rights
hereunder or any part thereof or interest therein, including the transfer of all or substantially all of Buyer’s economic interest in a Participation (each a
“Pre-Elevation Transfer”) prior to the occurrence of an Elevation:

(a) Buyer may not make a Pre-Elevation Transfer without obtaining the prior written consent of Seller to any person other than an Affiliate of
Buyer (it being understood that, with respect to a Pre-Elevation Transfer to

any Affiliate of Buyer, Buyer shall provide reasonable prior notice to Seller); provided, however, that no Pre-Elevation Transfer shall be effective unless
(i) such Pre-Elevation Transfer does not violate any applicable Law or regulation or cause Seller to violate or be in breach of any provision of any Credit
Document, (ii) the transferee in such Pre-Elevation Transfer (the “Transferee”) makes to Buyer for the express benefit of Seller substantially each of the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Buyer set forth herein, and (iii) the Transferee either (A) is organized under the Laws of the United
States or any State thereof or (B) has (1) represented to Seller that under applicable Law and treaties no taxes will be required to be withheld by Seller
with respect to any payments to be made to such Transferee in respect of the Transferred Rights and (2) shall have furnished to Seller such forms,
certifications, statements and other documents as Seller has reasonably requested or may reasonably request from time to time to evidence the
Transferee’s exemption from the withholding of any tax imposed by any jurisdiction or to enable Seller to comply with any applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may grant a security interest in any Participation or its rights under this Agreement, or any part thereof
or interest therein, to any agent, lender or other financing source of Buyer without the consent of or notice to Seller.

10.2 Seller may not assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Buyer.

10.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10, Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer may at any time and from time to
time (i) identify to Seller in writing a third party purchaser (each, a “Designated Purchaser”) with respect to all or any part of Participated Loan and
(ii) direct Seller in writing to sell and assign all or any part of such Participated Loan, as designated by Buyer to Seller in writing, to any such
Designated Purchaser at a purchase price and subject to other principal economic terms (including treatment of accrued interest) agreed between Buyer
and such Designated Purchaser (in their respective sole discretion) (each such sale and assignment, a “Buyer Directed Sale”); provided, that Seller shall
have no obligation to cause or pursue a Buyer Directed Sale to the extent (x) such Buyer Directed Sale would contravene any applicable Law or any
provision of any of the applicable Credit Documents or (y) expose Seller to any obligation, liability or expense that in Seller’s reasonable judgment is
material, and in each such case, for which Seller has not been provided adequate indemnity. In order to effect any Buyer Directed Sale, Seller shall
(a) execute and deliver the applicable Assignment with respect to the applicable Participated Loan in the form required under the related Credit
Documents, together with such other Loan Syndication and Trading Association form documents with respect to such sale as are applicable at the time
of such sale and are customarily required with respect to sales of similar loans and (b) execute and send a consent request or similar letter prepared by
Buyer to request all necessary consents under the Credit Agreement of the related Loan; provided, that Buyer shall pay, promptly upon invoice therefor
(and in any event within 10 Business Days of delivery of such invoice), any and all transfer, processing or recordation fees, costs, expenses and
disbursements payable in connection with any Buyer Directed Sale under this Section 10.3 (including in connection with employing a third-party trading
desk for execution thereof). Seller shall promptly notify Buyer upon the effectiveness of any such Buyer Directed Sale. The rights and obligations of
Seller and Buyer accruing or relating to the period prior to the effective date of such Buyer Directed Sale, and all representations and warranties made
by Seller or Buyer in this Agreement with respect to the related Participation, shall survive such Buyer Directed Sale. The proceeds received by Seller as
a result of any Buyer Directed Sale shall constitute a Distribution and shall be paid over to Buyer in accordance with Section 8.1 and, to the extent of
such Buyer Directed Sale, the Participation in the relevant Participated Loan shall be deemed released and extinguished.

 
11. Voting

11.1 On and after the Closing Date, Seller shall continue to have sole authority to make, grant and exercise (or refrain from making, granting and
exercising) all votes, whether pursuant to amendments, consents or waivers, and otherwise to exercise (or refrain from exercising) all other rights and
remedies with respect to the Transferred Rights and Assumed Obligations relating to each Participation, except with respect to matters as to

which a lender is not prohibited from granting a participant voting rights under the express terms of the applicable Credit Agreement (“Specified
Participant Voting Rights”). Only with respect to such Specified Participant Voting Rights, Seller shall take (or refrain from taking) any action with
respect to the Transferred Rights and Assumed Obligations relating to such Participation (an “Act”) in accordance with the prior instructions of Buyer,
in each case except (A) as restricted or prohibited under applicable law, rule, order or the Credit Documents relating to such Participation (and such
restrictions or prohibitions are hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth herein) or (B) if following such instructions might (in Seller’s reasonable
determination) expose Seller to any obligation, liability or expense that in Seller’s reasonable judgment is material and for which Seller has not been
provided adequate indemnity.

11.2 Any consent, instruction or other direction of Buyer permitted under Section 11.1 must be in writing and shall not be effective unless
received by Seller no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which such direction must be taken by Seller; provided, however, that if Seller
gives notice to Buyer of the Act that is to be taken less than one (1) Business Day prior to the time when such Act is to be taken and Buyer gives a
consent or other direction to Seller prior to the time when such Act is to be taken, Seller shall make commercially reasonable efforts to take into account
such direction with respect to such Act. Absent such timely consent or other direction (including the withholding of such consent) from Buyer, Seller
shall be entitled (but not required), in its sole discretion, to deem that Buyer has given its consent to take (or refrain from taking) any Act on behalf of
Buyer with respect to such matters; provided, however, that in doing so, Seller shall act in good faith and subject to the provisions of Section 12.

 
12. Standard of Care

12.1 Seller is not and shall not be deemed to be a fiduciary of the Buyer or any purpose hereunder, and, for the avoidance of doubt, will not be
held to the standard of care of a fiduciary. Seller agrees to exercise the same care in the administration and enforcement of the Participated Loans and the
Transferred Rights that it would exercise if it held the Transferred Rights solely for its own account, and except for losses that result from Seller’s gross
negligence or willful misconduct in the administration and enforcement of the Participated Loans and the Transferred Rights, or breach of any of the
express terms and provisions of this Agreement, it shall not be liable for any error in judgment or for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it;
provided that Seller’s duty of care is subject to Section 12.2. Seller may rely on any notice, consent, certificate, request or other written document or
communication received by Seller from Buyer or any Affiliate, employee or agent of Buyer that appears on its face, as determined by Seller in good
faith, to be genuine.

12.2 Seller (i) may rely on legal counsel (including counsel for any Borrower, any Agent or any other Lender), independent public accountants
and other consultants and advisors selected or accepted in good faith by Seller (collectively, the “Experts”), and Seller shall not be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by Seller in accordance with the advice of such Experts, (ii) may serve as a member of a creditors’ committee performing
such acts as may be authorized and vote (subject to Section 11 hereof) as a member of a designated class of creditors for a plan of reorganization related
to any Transferred Rights, (iii) shall be entitled to rely on, and shall incur no liability by acting upon, any conversation, notice, consent, certificate,
statement, order, or any document or other writing (including, without limitation, facsimile, electronic mail, or other telecommunication device) that
appears on its face, as determined by Seller in good faith, to be genuine, (iv) except as expressly set forth in Section 4, makes no warranty or
representation (express or implied) and shall not be responsible for any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Credit
Agreement or any related document or for the financial condition of any Borrower, (v) shall not have any duty to inspect the property (including the
books and records) of any Borrower or any Obligor, (vi) except as provided in Section 11, and subject to the standard of care set forth in Section 12.1,
shall have no obligations to make any claim, or assert any lien upon, any property held by Seller or assert any offset in respect thereto and (vii) shall
have no duties or obligations hereunder other than those expressly provided for herein.

12.3 Notwithstanding Sections 12.1 and 12.2 above, nothing in this Section 12 shall relieve Seller from any liability for its breach of any of its
express covenants in this Agreement.

13.1 No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the Parties, and no waiver of any
provision of this Agreement, nor consent to any departure by either Party from it, shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the affected
Party, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

13.2 No failure on the part of a Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver
by such Party, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights and remedies of each Party provided herein (a) are cumulative and are in addition to, and are not
exclusive of, any rights or remedies provided by Law (except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement) and (b) are not conditional or
contingent on any attempt by such Party to exercise any of its rights or remedies under any other related document or against the other Party or any other
Entity.

Buyer, if either Seller or a direct or indirect parent company of Seller (i) becomes the subject of a proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or (ii) had
appointed for it a receiver, custodian, conservator, trustee, administrator, assignee for the benefit of creditors or a similar Entity charged with
reorganization or liquidation of its business or assets, in each case, subject to the terms and provisions of the related Credit Documents and any
applicable Law, each Party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts and to take such actions as are reasonably necessary, as soon as reasonably
practicable, to cause Buyer to become a Lender under the applicable Credit Agreement with respect to all of the Transferred Rights relating to such
Participated Loan (an “Elevation”; and the date on which Buyer becomes a Lender under the applicable Credit Agreement, the “Elevation Date”);
provided that, (i) no Party shall have any obligation to cause or pursue an Elevation to the extent such Elevation would contravene any Law applicable
to either Party, and (ii) any (x) transfer fees and (y) out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by
Seller, in each case of clauses (x) and (y) above, in connection with such Elevation shall be paid by Buyer in connection with such Elevation. Upon the
applicable Elevation Date, to the extent of such Elevation, (i) Buyer shall assume all of the Assumed Obligations relating to such Participation,
(ii) Seller shall have no further responsibility in respect of such Assumed Obligations and (iii) this Agreement shall cease to apply to such Participation

Distributions in respect of all of the Loans and all related Commitments (if any), and Seller shall, to the extent required hereunder, have distributed all
such Distributions to Buyer, provided that if any such Distributions are received in connection with a restructuring of Loans or Commitments that
requires Seller contemporaneously to fund new advances to a Borrower, then such Distributions shall be retained by Seller to the extent necessary to
fund such new advances, and this Agreement (A) shall not terminate and (B) shall apply to such new advances, modified mutatis mutandis, (ii) all
Commitments (if any) have been terminated and (iii) no Borrower or Obligor shall have any remaining obligations under the Credit Documents (other
than obligations that, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Documents, shall survive the termination thereof); provided, that Sections 6, 7, 17, 18,
23, 24, 25, 26 and 27 (and any other Section required for the enforcement of such Sections) shall survive the termination of this Agreement, including
without limitation, the Buyer’s obligations to promptly pay when demanded any and all Reimbursement costs and other indemnified amounts payable
by Buyer hereunder.

 
17. Further Assurances

Each Party agrees to (i) execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such other and further agreements, documents and instruments
and (ii) take or cause to be taken all such other and further actions as the other Party may reasonably request to effectuate the intent and purposes, and
carry out the terms, of this Agreement, including the granting or procurement of the Participation Required Consents and, in connection with any
intended Elevation, the Elevation Required Consents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, on and after an Elevation with respect to any
Participation, Seller agrees that if (i) notes have been issued evidencing all or any portion of the applicable Loans and Commitments (if any), (ii) Buyer
is entitled to request (which request shall be in writing) that a new note or notes be issued to it, and (iii) the applicable Agent, the applicable Borrower or
any Governmental Authority requires either (x) the delivery of any note(s) evidencing such Loans and Commitments (if any) previously issued to Seller
or (y) the delivery of customary lost note documentation by Seller prior to the issuance thereof, then Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
either deliver such note(s) or customary lost note documentation to the applicable Agent; provided that Seller shall not be required to deliver either a
note or such lost note documentation if no note was ever issued or delivered to it and Seller shall not be required to provide to any Entity any
indemnification with respect to any lost note.

Without limiting the foregoing, Seller hereby makes, constitutes and appoints the Buyer, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact with respect to each Participation, with full power and authority in its name, place and stead, to execute, acknowledge and deliver any
Credit Document with respect thereto, as well as the applicable Assignment and any other agreement required by the related Credit Documents to effect
any Elevation permitted under Section 15. This grant of power of attorney is coupled with an interest and irrevocable.

obligations under this Section 17 and shall pay and reimburse Seller for all such amounts promptly upon invoice thereof.

required to do so by any Law, subpoena or other legal process, (iii) to any Governmental Authority or self-regulatory Entity having or asserting

each case, on a confidential basis), (vii) to any Sponsor (in each case, on a confidential basis), (viii) to any Agent (or prospective Agent) of any Loan
subject to a Participation hereunder, and (ix) to any proposed transferee, assignee or participant of the Transferred Rights or any part thereof (in each
case, on a confidential basis), and (b) Buyer may make any such disclosure to any of its or any of its Affiliates’ financing sources or prospective
financing sources. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 18.1 to the contrary, Seller shall be permitted to disclose to any lender or
prospective lender under a Loan Facility that Seller has sold a participation interest in a Loan under such Loan Facility to an unaffiliated Entity and a
description of the voting arrangement set forth in this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the following shall not be considered Confidential Information: (i) information made available to
the general public other than through a breach of this Agreement, (ii) information disclosed pursuant to judicial process, and (iii) information received
from independent sources on a non-confidential basis without a breach of a duty of confidentiality to any Party or a breach of this Section 18.

18.2 Buyer agrees, and shall cause its Affiliates and designees, and its and their directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, professional
advisors and auditors for purposes of receiving information or documents related to any Participated Loan, including in accordance with Section 9.2 to

the same extent as if it were a party to the applicable Credit Documents and shall, upon Seller’s request, provide to Seller a confidentiality undertaking
to such effect in accordance with the terms of such Credit Documents prior to the delivery of any such information or documents.

Each Party and any of their respective Affiliates may engage in any kind of lawful business or other relationship with any Borrower, any Obligor or any
of their respective Affiliates, without liability to the other Party or any obligation to disclose such business or relationship to the other Party.

 
20. Entire Agreement; Conflict

20.1 This Agreement (together with the APA) constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all previous and contemporaneous statements, marketing materials, negotiations, promises, covenants, agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties in respect thereof. As between Seller and Buyer, if there is any inconsistency between this Agreement and any of the
other Operative Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern and control. To the extent there are any inconsistencies between this
Agreement and the APA, the terms of this APA shall govern.

 
21. Counterparts; Electronic Transmission

This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts and all of such counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
instrument. Transmission by electronic transmission of an executed counterpart of this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute due and sufficient
delivery of such counterpart. Each fully executed counterpart of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a duplicate original.

 
22. Relationship Between Buyer and Seller

The relationship between Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall be that of seller and buyer. Neither Party is a trustee or agent for
the other Party, nor does either Party have any fiduciary obligations whatsoever to the other Party. In no event shall any Participation be construed as a
loan from Buyer to Seller.

The Parties do not intend the arrangement contemplated by this Agreement to create a partnership or joint venture for federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax
purposes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, Seller shall be

treated as a nominee for Buyer with respect to any Participation in a Loan. Each sale of a Participation in a Loan is intended by each of the Parties to be
treated as a true sale of such Loan (including any Commitment therefor and the related Transferred Rights) by Seller to Buyer for all purposes
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, for all purposes relating to income tax, financial accounting and creditors’ rights) and the assumption by Buyer of
all Assumed Obligations for all purposes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, for all purposes relating to income tax, financial accounting and
creditors’ rights), except that, as contemplated by Section 2.1(c), Seller shall hold title to each Loan for the benefit of Buyer. Each Party agrees to act in
accordance with, and to take such actions from time to time as may be reasonably requested by the other Party to confirm, reaffirm and give full effect
to, such intent. The Parties agree to file all tax returns in a manner consistent with the intended characterization for tax purposes, as described in this
Section 22.

 
23. Severability

The illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement under the Law of any jurisdiction shall not affect its legality, validity or

establish and maintain each Account and appropriate records identifying the Collateral in such Account as pledged by Pledgors to Secured Party.
Pledgors hereby authorize Securities Intermediary to comply with all Oral and Written Instructions, including entitlement orders, originated by Secured
Party with respect to the Collateral without further consent or direction from Pledgors or any other party.

2. Status of Securities Intermediary. The parties agree that with respect to the part of each Account consisting of a “securities account,” Securities

than cash) held in the part of such Account consisting of a “securities account” shall be treated as financial assets. The parties agree that with respect to

cash held in or credited to such Account shall be held in the part of such Account consisting of a “deposit account,” and such cash shall be treated as a
deposit liability of Securities Intermediary. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties further agree that cash shall not be treated as a financial asset.
Securities Intermediary represents that at the time of its entry into any agreement between any Pledgor and the Securities Intermediary governing any
Account (each such agreement, including this Agreement, an “Account Agreement”), the Securities Intermediary had a physical office in the United
States that engaged in a business or other regular activity of maintaining securities accounts. Securities Intermediary makes no representation or
warranties with respect to the creation, attachment, validity, priority, perfection or enforceability of any security interest in either Account or the
Collateral.

3. Use of Depositories. Secured Party and Pledgors hereby authorize Securities Intermediary to utilize Depositories to the extent possible in
connection with Securities Intermediary’s performance hereunder. Collateral held by Securities Intermediary in a Depository will be held subject to the
rules, terms and conditions of such Depository. Where Collateral is held in a Depository, Securities Intermediary shall identify on its records as
belonging to Pledgors and pledged to Secured Party a quantity of securities as part of a fungible bulk of securities held in Securities Intermediary’s
account at such Depository. Securities constituting Collateral deposited in a Depository will be represented in accounts which include only assets held
by Securities Intermediary for its customers.

Each of Pledgors and Secured Party acknowledges that securities constituting Collateral issued outside the United States (exclusive of Japanese
government bonds) (“Foreign Securities”) and non-U.S. cash held in each Account may be held by Securities Intermediary or a sub-custodian within
Securities Intermediary’s network of sub-custodians (each a “Subcustodian”) and such Foreign Securities or non-U.S. cash shall be held subject to the
terms and conditions of Securities Intermediary’s agreements with such Subcustodians. Subcustodians may be authorized to hold Foreign Securities and
non-U.S. cash in central securities depositories or clearing agencies in which such Subcustodians participate. Unless otherwise required by local law,
practice or a particular subcustodian agreement, Foreign Securities and/or non-U.S. cash deposited with Subcustodians will be held by Securities
Intermediary in a commingled account in the name of Securities Intermediary as custodian or trustee for its customers, and shall not (x) be registered in
the name of Pledgors, payable to the order of Pledgors or specially indorsed to Pledgors unless such Foreign Security has been further indorsed to
Securities Intermediary or in blank, or (y) be credited to a segregated securities account maintained in the name or for the benefit of Pledgors on the
books of any centralized depository, Subcustodian or other securities intermediary unless such Foreign Security has been further indorsed to Securities
Intermediary or in blank; provided; however, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by local law,
practice or a particular subcustodian agreement, a Subcustodian is required to hold Foreign Securities and/or non-U.S. cash other than as specified
above, Securities Intermediary shall make available notice thereof to Pledgors and Secured Party. The parties hereby further acknowledge that Securities
Intermediary gives no assurance that a security entitlement is created under the UCC with respect to Pledgors’ Foreign Securities held in Euroclear or
Clearstream or their successors.

4. Pledgor Representation. Each Pledgor represents and warrants that it owns the Collateral free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and
encumbrances (except those granted herein or as provided for in the

2. Notice of Exclusive Control. Secured Party may, subject to terms of the Collateral Agreement, exercise sole and exclusive control of the

Upon receipt of a Notice of Exclusive Control and after Securities Intermediary has had a reasonable time to comply with such Notice of Exclusive
Control, Securities Intermediary shall, without inquiry and without the need for consent or direction from either Pledgor or any other person who is not
Secured Party, thereafter comply with Oral or Written Instructions (including entitlement orders) solely from Secured Party with respect to the Accounts
and will cease complying with any Joint Written Instructions (including entitlement orders) concerning the Accounts or the Collateral held therein
originated by either Pledgor. Securities Intermediary will have no liability to Secured Party or Pledgors for complying with a Notice of Exclusive
Control or instructions originated by Secured Party in connection therewith. Securities Intermediary shall have no duty, responsibility or obligation to
independently verify, question or investigate (i) whether or not Secured Party is entitled to deliver a Notice of Exclusive Control, (ii) any fact,
information, instruction, calculation or claim contained in or provided in connection with a Notice of Exclusive Control, (iii) the accuracy, completeness
or veracity of any certification, covenant or statement made by Secured Party in a Notice of Exclusive Control or any subsequent instructions or
directions so received, (iv) whether or not any copies of items or notices required pursuant to this Agreement or any other document or understanding

document or understanding entered into between the Secured Party and Pledgors (including, but not limited to, the format, content, substance, efficacy
or sufficiency of such document). Securities Intermediary shall be fully protected for complying with a Notice of Exclusive Control, including any Oral
or Written Instructions originated by Secured Party in connection therewith, whether or not Pledgor may allege that no rights of Secured Party exist to
provide such instructions or to issue the Notice of Exclusive Control.

4. Payment of Proceeds. At all times, Securities Intermediary shall credit to the applicable Account all proceeds and interest received by it with
respect to the Collateral.

5. Priority of Securities Intermediary’s Security Interest. In order to secure the repayment of any fees, charges, expenses, and other amounts
payable to Securities Intermediary in accordance with the Custody Agreement, including without limitation, the repayment of any advances made by
Securities Intermediary in its sole discretion, from time to time to purchase or to make payment on or against delivery of any investment property to be
held in the Accounts, in each case to the extent permitted hereunder and in connection with the

of the Covered Expenses, until such time as the Securities Intermediary is repaid the amount of such Covered Expenses. Securities Intermediary hereby

Internet to an email address specified by it for such purpose. By electing to use the Internet for this purpose, each of Pledgor and Secured Party
acknowledges that such transmissions are not encrypted and therefore are insecure. Each Pledgor and Secured Party further acknowledges that there are
other risks inherent in communicating through the Internet such as the possibility of virus contamination and disruptions in service, and agrees that
Securities Intermediary shall not be responsible for any loss, damage or expense suffered or incurred by such Pledgor, Secured Party, or any person
claiming by or through such Pledgor or Secured Party as a result of the use of such methods.

Intermediary shall use reasonable efforts to notify Secured Party and Pledgors as promptly as practicable under the circumstances.

ARTICLE IV

shall be entitled to rely upon any Joint Written Instructions, Written Instructions or Oral Instructions actually received by Securities Intermediary and
reasonably believed by Securities Intermediary to be duly authorized and delivered. Secured Party and each Pledgor agrees (i) to forward to Securities

Securities Intermediary, and (ii) the fact that such confirming Written Instructions are not received or that contrary Written Instructions are received by
Securities Intermediary shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of transactions authorized and effected by Securities Intermediary pursuant to
its Oral Instructions that Securities Intermediary actually receives and reasonably believes to be duly authorized and delivered, where such transactions
are authorized and effected by Securities Intermediary prior to its receipt of such confirming or contrary Written Instructions.

(b) If Securities Intermediary receives Joint Written Instructions or Written Instructions which appear on their face to have been transmitted via
(i) computer facsimile, email (including as an attachment to an email), the Internet or other insecure electronic method, or (ii) secure electronic
transmission containing applicable authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys, Secured Party and each Pledgor understands and agrees

procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its transmission of Joint Written Instructions or Written Instructions provide to it a commercially
reasonable degree of protection in light of its particular needs and circumstances.

offered by Securities Intermediary, its use thereof shall be subject to the Terms and Conditions attached hereto as Appendix I. If Secured Party or

APPENDIX I

ELECTRONIC ACCESS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS

These Electronic Access Terms and Conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”) set forth the terms and conditions under which The Bank of New York
Mellon Corporation and/or its subsidiaries or joint ventures (collectively, “BNY Mellon”) will provide the undersigned entities and its (their) affiliates
listed on Schedule A (“You” and “Your”) with access to and use of BNY Mellon’s electronic information delivery site known as “BNY Mellon
Connect” and/or other BNY Mellon-designated access portals (“Electronic Access”). Access to and use of Electronic Access by You is contingent upon
and is in consideration for Your compliance with the terms and conditions set forth below. Electronic Access includes access to BNY Mellon web sites
accessible via BNY Mellon Connect and/or other BNY Mellon-designated access portals (“Sites”), pursuant to which You are able to access products
and services provided by BNY Mellon as well as data regarding Your accounts. You may amend Schedule A by delivering a revised version to BNY
Mellon.

Any particular product or service accessed by You through Electronic Access may be subject to a separate written agreement between You and BNY
Mellon with respect to such products and services (each a “Services Agreement”). In addition, terms and conditions and restrictions with respect to any
particular product or service accessed through Electronic Access (such as privacy and internet security matters), together with any disclaimers related to
the specific products or services, may be set forth on the Sites (hereinafter referred to as “Terms of Use”) and are applicable to such products and
services. By Your signature below, You agree to the Terms and Conditions. By any of Your Users accessing the Sites, and the products and services
available through Electronic Access, You agree to any Terms of Use and acknowledge and accept any disclaimers and disclosures included on the Sites
and the restrictions concerning the use of proprietary data provided by Information Providers (as defined below) that are posted on the Data Terms Web
Site (as defined below). For the avoidance of doubt, the execution of these Terms and Conditions will not alter or amend or otherwise affect any
Services Agreement whether such Services Agreement is executed prior to or after the execution of these Terms and Conditions.
 

1. Access Administration:
 

 

a. To facilitate access to Electronic Access, You will furnish BNY Mellon with a written list of the names, and the extent of authority or level
of access, of persons You are authorizing to access the Sites, products and services and to use the Electronic Access (“Authorized Users”)
on a read-only basis. In addition, You may also designate Authorized Users who will have authority to enter transactions and provide
instructions to BNY Mellon that cause a change in or have an impact on assets held by BNY Mellon for Your accounts (“Authorized
Transactional Users”). Where appropriate, Authorized Users and Authorized Transactional Users are collectively referred to herein as
“Users.” If You wish to allow any third party (such as an investment manager, consultant or third party service provider) or any employee of
a third party to have access to Your account information through Electronic Access and be included as a “User” under these Terms and
Conditions, You may designate a third party or employee of a third party as an Authorized User or Authorized Transactional User under
these Terms and Conditions and any such third party or employee of a third party so designated by You (and, if a third party is so designated,
any employee of such third party designated by such third party) will be included within the definition of Authorized User, Authorized
Transactional User, and User as appropriate.

 

 

b. Upon BNY Mellon’s approval of Users (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld), BNY Mellon will send You a user-id,
temporary password and, where applicable, a security identification device for each User. You will be responsible for providing to Users the
user-ids, temporary passwords and, where applicable, secure identification devices. You will ensure that any User receiving a secure
identification device returns such device immediately following the termination of the User’s authorization to access the products and
services for which the secure identification device was provided to such User. You are solely responsible for Users’ access to Electronic
Access, and You and Users are solely responsible for the confidentiality of the user-ids and passwords and secure identification devices that
are provided to them and will remain responsible for each secure

Mellon will have no duty or obligation to verify or confirm the actual identity of the person who accessed Electronic Access using a validly
issued user-id and password (and, where applicable, security identification device) or that the person who accessed Electronic Access using
such validly issued user-id and password (and, where applicable, security identification device) is, in fact, a User (whether an Authorized
User or an Authorized Transactional User).

 

 
c. You shall not, and shall not permit any User or third party to, breach or attempt to breach any security measures used in connection with

Electronic Access or Proprietary Software. Any attempt to circumvent or penetrate any application, network or other security measures used

and conditions, restrictions on the use of such products and services and data obtained through the use of Electronic Access. BNY Mellon
reserves the right to prohibit access or revoke the access of any User to Electronic Access whom BNY Mellon determines has violated or
breached these terms and conditions or any Terms of Use on a Site accessed by the User, including the Data Terms Web Site (as defined
below), or whose conduct BNY Mellon reasonably determines may constitute a criminal offense, violate any applicable local, state, national,
or international law or constitute a security risk for BNY Mellon, a BNY Mellon’s third party supplier (“BNY Mellon’s Supplier”), BNY
Mellon’s clients or any Users of Electronic Access. BNY Mellon may also terminate access to all Users following termination of all
Services Agreements between You and BNY Mellon.

 

2. Proprietary Software: Depending upon the products and services You elect to access through Electronic Access, You may be provided software
owned by BNY Mellon or licensed to BNY Mellon by a BNY Mellon Supplier (“Proprietary Software”). You are granted a limited, non-exclusive,
non-transferable license to install the Proprietary Software on Your authorized computer system (including mobile devices registered with BNY
Mellon) and to use the Proprietary Software solely for Your own internal purposes in connection with Electronic Access and solely for the
purposes for which it is provided to You. You and Your Users may make copies of the Proprietary Software for backup purposes only, provided all
copyright and other proprietary information included in the original copy of the Proprietary Software are reproduced in or on such backup copies.
You shall not reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or attempt to determine the source code for, any Proprietary Software. Any attempt to
circumvent or penetrate security of Electronic Access is strictly prohibited.

 

3. Use of Data:
 

 

a. Electronic Access may include information and data that is proprietary to the providers of such information or data (“Information
Providers”) or may be used to access Sites that include such information or data from Information Providers. This information and data may
be subject to restrictions and requirements which are imposed on BNY Mellon by the Information Providers and which are posted on
http://www.bnymellon.com/products/assetservicing/vendoragreement.pdf or any successor web site of which You are provided notice from
time to time (the “Data Terms Web Site”). You will be solely responsible for ensuring that Users comply with the restrictions and
requirements concerning the use of proprietary data that are posted on the Data Terms Web Site.

restrictions and requirements concerning the use of Information Providers’ proprietary data that are posted on the Data Terms Web Site, the

party if any breach remains uncured after ten (10) days’ written notice of the breach is sent to the breaching party.

 

 
c. BNY Mellon may immediately terminate access through an Authorized User’s user-id and password and may, at its discretion, also

Opinion of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC

October 16, 2017

Board of Directors
NewStar Financial, Inc.
500 Boylston Street, Suite 1250
Boston, Massachusetts 02116

Board of Directors:

You have asked us to advise you in your capacity as the Board of Directors of NewStar Financial, Inc. (“NewStar”) with respect to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to holders of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“NewStar Common Stock”), of NewStar, other than as specified
herein, of the Merger Consideration (as defined below) provided for pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger
Agreement”) to be entered into among First Eagle Holdings, Inc. (“First Eagle Holdings”), an entity affiliated with or managed by First Eagle
Investment Management, LLC (“First Eagle”), FE Holdco, LLC, a wholly owned direct subsidiary of First Eagle Holdings (“FE Holdco”), FE Merger
Sub, Inc., a wholly owned direct subsidiary of FE Holdco (“Merger Sub”), and NewStar. The Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, the
merger of Merger Sub with and into NewStar (the “Merger”) pursuant to which NewStar will become a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of First Eagle
Holdings and each outstanding share of NewStar Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive (i) $11.44 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”)
and (ii) subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, one contractual contingent value right (the “CVR” and,
together with the Cash Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”) entitling the holder thereof to a pro rata portion of certain net U.S. federal and state
income tax refunds received by NewStar as a result of losses recognized by NewStar for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes from the
consummation of the Asset Sale (as defined below). We understand that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement and an Asset Purchase Agreement (the
“Asset Purchase Agreement” and, together with the Merger Agreement, the “Agreements”) to be entered into between NewStar and GSO Diamond
Portfolio Holdco LLC (“GSO Diamond”), immediately prior to and as a condition to the consummation of the Merger, GSO Diamond or its controlled
affiliates will acquire certain assets and assume certain related liabilities of NewStar and its subsidiaries (the “Asset Sale” and, together with the Merger,
the “Transaction”), the proceeds from which will fund a portion of the Cash Consideration. The terms and conditions of the Transaction and related
transactions are set forth more fully in the Agreements and related documents.

In arriving at our opinion, we have reviewed drafts, dated October 15, 2017 and October 16, 2017, of the Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase
Agreement, respectively, and certain publicly available business and financial information relating to NewStar. We also have reviewed certain other
information relating to NewStar provided to or discussed with us by the management of NewStar, including financial forecasts and estimates relating to
NewStar prepared by the management of NewStar (the “Forecasts”), as well as certain tax information relating to NewStar provided to us by the
management of NewStar as reviewed and discussed by the management of NewStar with NewStar’s tax advisors, including estimates and other
information as to certain potential tax attributes of NewStar, potential tax refunds anticipated to be received by NewStar as a result of, and in connection
with, the Asset Sale, and underlying assumptions with respect to the CVR (the “Tax Information”), and we have met with the management of NewStar
to discuss the businesses and prospects of NewStar. We also have considered certain financial and stock market data of NewStar, and we have compared
that data with similar data for companies with publicly traded equity securities in businesses we deemed relevant, and we have considered, to the extent
publicly available, the financial terms of certain other business combinations and transactions which have been effected or announced. We also
considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria which we deemed relevant.

In connection with our review, we have not independently verified any of the foregoing information and we have assumed and relied upon such
information being complete and accurate in all material respects. With respect to the Forecasts and the Tax Information that we have been directed to
utilize in our analyses, we have been advised by the management of NewStar, and we have assumed, with your consent, that such Forecasts and Tax
Information have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of such management as to the future
financial performance of NewStar and the other matters covered thereby and are appropriate for our use and reliance for purposes of our analyses and
opinion. With respect to the Tax Information, including, without limitation, as to tax filings and potential tax refunds, we also have assumed, with your
consent, that (i) all applicable tax filings and claims for refunds will be timely made on behalf of NewStar, (ii) such potential tax refunds will be
received by NewStar in full in the amounts and at the times indicated by the management of NewStar, (iii) such potential tax refunds will be paid to
NewStar’s stockholders in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement in the amounts and at the times contemplated therein without
adjustment, delay or condition and (iv) the Tax Information regarding such tax filings, potential tax refunds, including the amounts and timing of such
potential tax refunds, and any other tax matters relevant to the CVR or otherwise is consistent with the advice received by NewStar from its tax advisors.
We express no opinion as to any Forecasts or Tax Information (including, without limitation, as to potential tax refunds or the amounts or timing
thereof) or the assumptions on which they are based. We have relied, with your consent and without independent verification, upon the assessments of
the management of NewStar as to, among other things, (A) the Asset Sale, including with respect to the timing thereof and the assets, liabilities and
financial and other terms involved, (B) the financial and other terms associated with the CVR, including, without limitation, the likelihood, amount and
timing of payments pursuant to the CVR, (C) the potential impact on NewStar of certain market, competitive, cyclical and other trends in and prospects
for, and governmental, regulatory and legislative matters relating to or otherwise affecting, the lending and asset management industries and related
credit and financial markets and (D) existing and future relationships, agreements and arrangements with, and the ability to attract, retain and/or replace,
key sources of financing, employees and other commercial relationships of NewStar. We have assumed, with your consent, that there will be no
developments with respect to any such matters that would have an adverse effect on NewStar or the Transaction or that otherwise would be meaningful
in any respect to our analyses or opinion.

In connection with our opinion, we have not been requested to make, and we have not made, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (contingent, accrued, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise) of NewStar or any other entity, nor have we been furnished for purposes of
our analyses or opinion with any such evaluations or appraisals, and our analyses should not be construed as such. We are not appraisers or experts in
the evaluation of, nor do we express any view or opinion as to, any loan portfolios or individual credit files or the adequacy or sufficiency of allowances
for doubtful accounts and credit losses, provisions for loan losses, loan loss reserves or any other similar matters. We have been advised by the
management of NewStar and therefore we have assumed, with your consent, that any such allowances, provisions and reserves are in the aggregate
adequate and sufficient to cover such losses. We also have not been requested to make, and we have not made, an evaluation of the solvency or fair
value of NewStar, First Eagle or any other entity under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters.

We have assumed, with your consent, that, in the course of obtaining any regulatory or third-party consents, approvals, agreements or waivers in
connection with the Transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications,
will be imposed or occur that would have an adverse effect on NewStar or the Transaction or that otherwise would be meaningful in any respect to our
analyses or opinion and that the Transaction will be consummated on or prior to March 31, 2018 and otherwise consummated in accordance with the
terms of the Agreements and related documents and in

compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or
agreement thereof. Representatives of NewStar have advised us, and we also have assumed, with your consent, that the terms of the Agreements, when
executed, will conform in all material respects to the terms reflected in the drafts reviewed by us. We are not expressing any opinion with respect to
accounting, tax, regulatory, legal or similar matters and have assumed that NewStar has or will obtain such advice or opinions from appropriate
professional sources, and we have relied, with your consent, upon the assessments of representatives of NewStar as to such matters.

Our opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date hereof, of the Merger Consideration (to the extent expressly
specified herein), without taking into account any premium or discount for control, liquidity or otherwise, including any illiquidity discount with respect
to the CVR or any interest income on any undistributed portion of applicable tax refunds, and without regard to individual circumstances of specific
holders with respect to any rights or aspects which may distinguish such holders or the securities of NewStar held by such holders. Our opinion does not
in any way address any other consideration to be received in connection with the Transaction or related transactions or proportionate allocation or
relative fairness. Our opinion also does not address the Asset Sale or any other terms, aspects or implications of the Merger, including, without
limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, the form or structure, or financial or other terms of, the Asset Sale, the form of the Merger Consideration
or any terms, aspects or implications of any sub-advisory, investment management, servicing or other agreement, arrangement or understanding to be
entered into in connection with, related to or contemplated by the Transaction, any related transactions or otherwise. In addition, our opinion does not
address the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspect relating to, any compensation or other consideration to any officers, directors,
employees or stockholders of any party to the Transaction or related transactions or any related entities, or class of such persons, relative to the Merger
Consideration or otherwise. The issuance of this opinion was approved by our authorized internal committee.

Our opinion is necessarily based upon information made available to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as
they exist and can be evaluated on the date hereof. As you are aware, the credit, financial and stock markets, the industries and markets in which
NewStar and its customers operate, and the trading prices of NewStar Common Stock, have experienced and continue to experience volatility and we
express no view or opinion as to any potential effects of such volatility on NewStar, NewStar Common Stock or the Transaction. It should be understood
that subsequent developments may affect this opinion, and we do not have any obligation to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw this opinion. We are
not expressing any opinion as to the actual value of the CVR when issued or actual payment amounts when received pursuant to the CVR or the prices
at which NewStar Common Stock or other securities will trade or be transferable at any time, including following consummation of the Transaction. In
connection with our engagement, we were not requested to, and we did not, undertake a third-party solicitation process on behalf of NewStar with
respect to the acquisition of all or a part of NewStar; however, at the direction of the Board of Directors of NewStar, we have been requested, following
public announcement of the Transaction and as contemplated by the terms thereof, to undertake a go-shop process on behalf of NewStar to solicit third-
party indications of interest in the acquisition of NewStar. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Transaction or related transactions as
compared to alternative transactions or strategies that might be available to NewStar, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Board
of Directors of NewStar or NewStar to proceed with the Transaction or related transactions.

We have acted as financial advisor to NewStar in connection with the Transaction and will receive a fee for our services, the principal portion of which
is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. We also became entitled to receive a fee upon the rendering of our opinion and may receive an
additional fee payable at the sole

[Letterhead of Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc.]

October 16, 2017

NewStar Financial, Inc.
500 Boylston Street, Suite 1250
Boston, MA 02116
Attn: Board of Directors

Dear Board of Directors:

We understand that NewStar Financial, Inc. (the “Company”) intends to enter into (i) an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase
Agreement”) by and between GSO Diamond Portfolio Holdco LLC (“Asset Buyer”) and the Company pursuant to which, among other things and as
described more fully in the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company will sell (the “Asset Sale”) to the Buyer certain loan and other assets (the
“Purchased Assets”) subject to certain liabilities and obligations arising under the Purchased Assets in exchange for $2,370,700,000 in cash (the
“Purchase Price for the Purchased Assets”), subject to adjustment as provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement as to which we express no opinion and
(ii) an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement” and, together with the Asset Purchase Agreement, the “Agreements”) by and among
First Eagle Holdings, Inc. (“Parent”), FE Holdco, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Buyer”), FE Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Buyer (“Merger Sub”), and the Company pursuant to which, among other things and as described more fully in the Merger Agreement,
immediately following the Asset Sale, (a) Merger Sub will merge with the Company (the “Merger” and, together with the Asset Sale as a single, unitary
transaction, the “Transaction”), and (b) each outstanding share of the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”), of the Company
will be converted into the right to receive $11.44 in cash (the “Closing Per Share Cash Consideration”) and one contractual contingent value right (a
“Contingent Value Right” and, together with the Closing Per Share Cash Consideration, the “Consideration”) representing the right to receive certain
contingent payments following the receipt by the Company after the consummation of the Transaction of certain tax refunds as set forth in, and subject
to the terms and conditions of, the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement.

The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has requested that Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. (“Houlihan Lokey”) provide an opinion
(the “Opinion”) to the Board as to whether, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock, other than Corsair
Capital LLC (“Corsair”), GSO Capital Partners LP (“GSO”), The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Blackstone”), and their respective affiliates (collectively, the
“Excluded Stockholders”), pursuant to the Merger Agreement in connection with the Transaction is fair to such holders (other than the Excluded
Stockholders) from a financial point of view.

In connection with this Opinion, we have made such reviews, analyses and inquiries as we have deemed necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances. Among other things, we have:
 

 1. reviewed a draft, dated October 15, 2017, of the Asset Purchase Agreement and a draft, dated October 15, 2017, of the Merger Agreement;
 

 2. reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we deemed to be relevant;
 

 
3. reviewed certain information relating to the historical, current and future operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company made

available to us by the Company, including financial projections prepared by the management of the Company relating to the Company for
the years ending December 31, 2017 through 2020 (the “Projections”);

4. reviewed certain estimates prepared by the management of the Company with the assistance of the Company’s tax advisors regarding the

probability, timing and amounts of the contingent payments that will be paid pursuant to the Contingent Value Rights (the “CVR
Estimates”);

 

 
5. spoken with certain members of the management of the Company and certain of its representatives and advisors regarding the business,

operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company, the Transaction and related matters;
 

 
6. compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with that of other companies with publicly traded equity securities that

we deemed to be relevant; and
 

 7. conducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other information and factors as we deemed appropriate.

We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all data, material and other information
furnished, or otherwise made available, to us, discussed with or reviewed by us, or publicly available, and do not assume any responsibility with respect
to such data, material and other information. In addition, we have been advised, and we have assumed, that (i) the Projections have been reasonably
prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of management of the Company as to the future financial
results and condition of the Company and (ii) the CVR Estimates have been reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of management of the Company as to the probability, timing and amounts of the contingent payments that will be
paid pursuant to the Contingent Value Rights. We have assumed that the Projections and the CVR Estimates provide a reasonable basis on which to
evaluate the Company and the Transaction and, with your approval, used and relied upon the Projections and the CVR Estimates for purposes of our
analyses and this Opinion. We express no view or opinion with respect to the Projections, the CVR Estimates or the respective assumptions on which
they are based. We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that there has been no change in the business, assets, liabilities,
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of the Company since the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and
other information, financial or otherwise, provided to us that would be material to our analyses or this Opinion, and that there is no information or any
facts that would make any of the information reviewed by us incomplete or misleading. With your consent, we have assumed that any adjustments to the
Purchase Price for the Purchased Assets pursuant to the Agreements or otherwise would not be material to our analyses or this Opinion.

We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (a) the representations and warranties of all parties to the Agreements
and all other related documents and instruments that are referred to therein are true and correct, (b) each party to the Agreements and such other related
documents and instruments will fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by such party, (c) all conditions
to the consummation of the Transaction will be satisfied without waiver thereof, and (d) the Transaction will be consummated in a timely manner in
accordance with the terms described in the Agreements and such other related documents and instruments, without any amendments or modifications
thereto. We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (i) the Transaction will be consummated in a manner that complies in
all respects with all applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations, and (ii) all governmental, regulatory, and other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained and that no delay, limitations, restrictions or conditions will be imposed or
amendments, modifications or waivers made that would have an effect on the Transaction or the Company that would be material to our analyses or this
Opinion. In addition, we have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that the final forms of the Agreements will not differ in any
respect from the drafts of the Agreements identified above.

Furthermore, in connection with this Opinion, we have not been requested to make, and have not made, any physical inspection or independent
appraisal of any of the assets, properties or liabilities (fixed, contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of the Company or any other party,
including, without limitation, the

loans being transferred in the Asset Sale, nor were we provided with any such appraisal in connection with this Opinion. We did not make an
independent evaluation of the adequacy of the Company’s allowances for loan or credit losses, nor have we reviewed any individual loan files, credit
memos or assigned asset values. You have advised us that, in the absence of the Transaction, the Company is not contemplating sales of assets that
would generate losses that could be used to offset past or future taxes payable on its income and, at your direction, for purposes of our analyses and this
Opinion, we have assumed that such potential losses will not be realized or utilized by the Company on a standalone basis and, consequently, have no
current value to the Company. We did not estimate, and express no opinion regarding, the liquidation value of any entity or business. We have
undertaken no independent analysis of any potential or actual litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to
which the Company is or may be a party or is or may be subject, or of any governmental investigation of any possible unasserted claims or other
contingent liabilities to which the Company is or may be a party or is or may be subject. We note that, for purposes of this Opinion, we did not rely upon
a review of the publicly available financial terms of other transactions because we did not identify a sufficient number of relevant transactions in which
we deemed the acquired companies to be sufficiently similar to the Company.

In connection with the rendering of this Opinion, we have not been requested to, and did not, (a) initiate or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, or solicit any indications of interest from, third parties with respect to the Transaction or any portion or aspect thereof, the securities,
assets, business or operations of the Company or any other party, or any alternatives to the Transaction or any portion or aspect thereof, (b) negotiate the
terms of the Transaction or any portion or aspect thereof, (c) assist the Company in structuring the Transaction or any portion or aspect thereof, or
(d) advise the Board, the Company or any other party with respect to alternatives to the Transaction or any portion or aspect thereof.

This Opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as
of, the date hereof. We have not undertaken, and are under no obligation, to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw this Opinion, or otherwise comment on
or consider events occurring or coming to our attention after the date hereof, including potential changes in U.S. trade and tax laws, regulations and
government policies and the enforcement thereof as have been or may be proposed by parts of the federal government. We are not expressing any
opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the Common Stock may be purchased or sold, or otherwise be transferable, at any time.

This Opinion is furnished for the use of the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the Transaction and may not be
used for any other purpose without our prior written consent. This Opinion is not intended to be, and does not constitute, a recommendation to the
Board, the Company, any security holder or any other party as to how to act or vote with respect to any matter relating to the Transaction or any portion
or aspect thereof or otherwise.

In the ordinary course of business, certain of our employees and affiliates, as well as investment funds in which they may have financial interests
or with which they may co-invest, may acquire, hold or sell, long or short positions, or trade, in debt, equity, and other securities and financial
instruments (including loans and other obligations) of, or investments in, the Company, Asset Buyer, Buyer, Parent or any other party that may be
involved in the Transaction or any portion or aspect thereof and their respective affiliates or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the
Transaction or any portion or aspect thereof. In addition, we understand that ORIX Corporation, a stockholder of Houlihan Lokey, and/or one or more of
its affiliates, is (i) a participant in a syndicated loan to First Eagle (as defined below), (ii) an investor in an investment fund that is a member of the GSO
Group (as defined below) and (iii) is a lender or a participant in syndicated loans to, and is a limited partner of, one or more members of the Blackstone
Group (as defined below).

Houlihan Lokey and certain of its affiliates have in the past provided and are currently providing investment banking, financial advisory and/or
other financial or consulting services to the Company, First Eagle Investment Management, Inc., an affiliate of Parent (“First Eagle”), or one or more
security holders or affiliates of, and/or

substantial portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Transaction. In addition, we will receive a fee for rendering this Opinion,
which is not contingent upon the successful completion of the Transaction. In addition, pursuant to the Company’s request, following the execution of
the Agreements we will assist the Company in soliciting proposals from third parties regarding a sale, merger, business combination or other similar

class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the
corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation
contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as
nearly as is practicable.

 

 (d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
 

 

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was
such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title)
with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are
available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of
the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal
of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written
demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or
vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by
a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving
or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has
not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective;
or

 

 

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent
corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days
thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal
rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series
of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent
corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder
entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant
to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the
date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares.
Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder
intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the
merger or consolidation notifying each of the

holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the
merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within
10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of
the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the
offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be
sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance
with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to
give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a
record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is
given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice
is given.

 

 

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal
proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has
not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s
demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon
written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting
forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have
been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days
after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding
subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on
behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this
subsection.

 

 

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation,
which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list
containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the
value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or
resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court,
shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting
corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington,
Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the
Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become
entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock
represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to
which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of
such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for
such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

 

 

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules
of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall
determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except
as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be
compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to
time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of
judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case
interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,
proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name
appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

 

 

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to
the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith,
and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock.
The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting
corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

 

 

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances.
Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the
appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata
against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

 

 
(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in

subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on
the stock (except dividends or

other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided,
however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder
shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance
of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of
this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the
approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this
provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days
after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

Forward-Looking Statements

Statements in this Annual Report about our anticipated financial condition, results of operations, and growth, as well as about the future
development of our products and markets and the future performance of the financial markets in general, are forward-looking statements. You can
identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They may include words such as “anticipate,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “may,” “should,” “can have,” “likely” and other words and terms of similar meaning in
connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events and circumstances, including the
timing and amount of any future dividend payments. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our
industry experience and on our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors. As you read this
Annual Report, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks and uncertainties that are
beyond our control. Important information about the bases for our assumptions and factors that may cause our actual results and other circumstances to
differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements are discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and generally throughout this Annual
Report.

PART I
 

Item 1. Business

Overview

NewStar Financial, Inc. (which is referred to throughout this Annual Report as “NewStar”, “the Company”, “we” and “us”) is an internally-
managed, commercial finance company with $6.7 billion of assets managed across two complementary business lines- middle market direct lending and
asset management. The Company’s direct lending activities are focused on meeting the complex financing needs of companies and private investors in
the middle market by offering a range of flexible debt financing options. Through its asset management platforms, NewStar offers a range of investment
products employing credit-oriented strategies focused on middle market loans and liquid, tradeable credit.

We believe these lending activities require specialized skills and transaction experience, as well as, a significant investment in personnel and
operating infrastructure. To meet these demands, our loans and leases are originated directly by teams of credit-trained bankers organized around key
industry and market segments. These teams are supported by centralized credit management and operating platforms. This structure enables us to
leverage common standards, systems, and industry and professional expertise across multiple businesses.

We target our marketing and origination efforts at private equity firms, mid-sized companies, corporate executives, banks and a variety of other
referral sources and financial intermediaries to develop new customer relationships and source lending opportunities. Our origination network is national
in scope and we target companies with business operations across a broad range of industry sectors. We employ highly experienced bankers and credit
professionals to identify and structure new lending opportunities and manage customer relationships. We believe that the quality of our professionals,
the breadth of their relationships and referral networks, and their ability to develop creative solutions for customers position us to be a valued partner
and preferred lender for mid-sized companies and private equity funds with middle market investment strategies.

Our emphasis on direct origination is an important aspect of our marketing and credit strategy. Our national network is designed around
specialized origination channels intended to generate a large set of potential lending opportunities. That allows us to be highly selective in our credit
process and to allocate capital to market segments that we believe represent the most attractive opportunities. Our direct origination network also
generates proprietary lending opportunities with yield characteristics that we believe would not otherwise be available through intermediaries. In
addition, direct origination provides us with direct access to management teams and enhances our ability to conduct detailed due diligence and credit
analysis of prospective borrowers. It also allows us to negotiate transaction terms directly with borrowers and, as a result, advise our customers on
financial strategies and capital structures, which we believe benefits our credit performance.

Table of Contents

The Company typically provides financing commitments to companies in amounts that range in size from $15 million to $50 million. The size of
financing commitments depends on various factors, including the type of loan, the credit characteristics of the borrower, the economic characteristics of
the loan, and our role in the transaction. We also selectively arrange larger transactions that we may retain on our balance sheet or syndicate to other
lenders, which may include funds that we manage for third party institutional investors. By syndicating loans to other lenders and our managed funds,
we are able to provide larger financing commitments to our customers and generate fee income, while limiting our risk exposure to single borrowers.
From time to time, however, our balance sheet exposure to a single borrower exceeds $35 million.

Beginning in January 2016, our operations were divided into two reportable segments that represent our core businesses, Commercial Lending and
Asset Management.

The Commercial Lending segment represents our direct lending activities which are focused on providing a range of flexible senior secured debt
options to mid-sized companies with annual cash flow (EBITDA) typically between $15 million and $50 million owned by private equity investment
funds and managed by established professional alternative asset managers.

The Asset Management segment represents our investment advisory activities which are focused on providing opportunities for qualified investors
to invest in a range of credit funds managed by the Company. The Asset Management segment manages a series of private credit funds that co-invest in
middle market loans originated through our established direct lending platform. Additionally, in October 2015, NewStar acquired Boston-based
Feingold O’Keeffe Capital, LLC (“FOC Partners”), a boutique credit manager with $2.3 billion of assets under management, to expand its existing asset
management capabilities. NewStar operates FOC Partners as NewStar Capital. Through this wholly-owned subsidiary, the Company manages over
$2 billion in assets across a series of CLOs that invest primarily in broadly syndicated loans, as well as other sponsored funds and managed accounts
that invest across various liquid, non-investment grade asset classes, including broadly syndicated loans and bonds.

Information regarding revenues, profits and losses and total assets of these segments can be found in the financial statements in Item 8.

NewStar is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 2004. Our principal executive office is located at 500 Boylston Street, Suite 1250,
Boston, Massachusetts 02116, and our telephone number is (617) 848-2500. We maintain a website at www.newstarfin.com.

Commercial Lending

During 2016, the Company sold its asset based lending business, NewStar Business Credit LLC (“Business Credit”) and the assets of NewStar
Equipment Finance (“Equipment Finance”) and the related platform. The sale of these lending platforms demonstrated a continuation of the Company’s
transformation from a bank-styled, diversified commercial finance company into a more specialized middle market direct lender with a focus on
managing assets for institutional investors. In addition to the sale, the Company has accelerated the disposition of the real estate portfolio. This reflects
the Company’s strategic decision to exit businesses with economic models increasingly challenged by competition from banks and other lenders with
access to lower cost funding.

Leveraged Finance

Through our Leveraged Finance group, the Company provides senior, secured cash flow loans and, to a lesser extent, first out, second lien and
unitranche loans, to middle market companies. These companies are typically backed by established private equity groups that manage large investment
funds and have proven investment track records. The proceeds of these loans are used primarily for acquisitions, recapitalizations and refinancing or
other general corporate purposes. The Leveraged Finance group also provides senior secured loans to larger middle market companies with greater
financing needs by participating in larger credit facilities with other lenders as a member of a syndicate.

Table of Contents

We believe that private equity backed companies represent an attractive segment of the overall market for financing middle market companies.
Commonly known as sponsored lending, this financing segment is large, often representing 30-40% of total middle market lending measured by new
loan volume. Transaction activity in this financing segment is driven by an estimated 600 private equity firms in the US that specialize in investing in
middle market companies. By focusing our origination activity on this universe of firms, the Company seeks to leverage its direct origination effort into
significant transaction flow, as each firm typically completes several transactions per year.

We believe that NewStar is among the most active lenders focused on financing private equity backed companies in the middle market. We have
established a recognized brand in the market with a reputation as a smart, reliable lender that is responsive, consistent and constructive. Since inception,
the Company has funded loans totaling more than $13.7 billion related to approximately 650 transactions backed by approximately 250 different
financial sponsors. We develop new customer relationships and source our loans primarily through the direct marketing and origination efforts of our
bankers. The Company’s bankers call directly on prospective clients and referrals sources from this network of offices. They have established
relationships with a wide range of prospective customers and referral sources, including approximately 200 private equity groups with investment
strategies focused on the middle market, mid-sized companies, corporate executives, banks, other non-bank “club” lenders, and investment banks. To a
lesser extent, we may also source loans and other debt products by participating in larger credit facilities syndicated by other lenders.

We generally compete for lending opportunities on the basis of our reputation and transaction experience. In December of 2014, NewStar formed
a strategic relationship with GSO Capital (“GSO”), the credit division of Blackstone, and Franklin Square Capital Partners (“Franklin Square”), one of
the largest managers of business development companies. As part of this relationship, funds managed by Franklin Square and sub-advised by GSO
purchased $300 million of 8.25% subordinated notes due 2024 with warrants exercisable for 12 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price
of $12.62 (the “warrants”). The Company used the proceeds from these issuances to enhance its ability to originate and lead transactions. In addition,
our relationship with GSO has resulted in cross-referral and co-lending opportunities, provided us with access to new channels of origination, and
enabled us to provide larger capital commitments and a more complete set of financing options to our clients. We believe that our strategic relationship
will continue to help us compete more effectively for lending opportunities by enabling us to provide larger credit commitments and “one-stop”
financing solutions to customers comprised of unitranche loans or a combination of senior and junior debt capital in partnership with GSO or Franklin

NewStar offers a range of senior debt financing options, including revolving credit facilities, term loans and other debt products secured by a
variety of business assets. Loans are typically structured to mature in five to six years and require monthly or quarterly interest payments at variable
rates based on a spread to LIBOR or the prime rate, many with interest rate floors. Through our strategic relationship, we also seek to offer a more
complete range of debt financing options, including second lien term loans, unitranche term loans, subordinated notes and, to a lesser extent, private
equity co-investments.

We target mid-sized companies operating in a broad range of industries and market segments where we believe that we have competitive
advantages and significant lending and underwriting experience, including:
 

 •  healthcare;
 

 •  manufacturing and industrial;
 

 •  financial services;
 

 •  energy/chemical services;
 

 •  printing/publishing;
 

 •  consumer, retail and restaurants; and
 

 •  business and technology services.

Our loans and other debt products, which may be part of larger credit facilities, typically range in size from $15 million to $50 million, although
we generally limit the size of the loans that we retain to $25 million. In certain cases, however, our loans and debt products exceed $35 million. We also
have the capability to arrange significantly larger transactions which we syndicate to other lenders, including funds that we manage. As a result of
syndication and asset management activities, our exposure to certain loans and other debt products exceeds $35 million from time to time through
“Loans held-for-sale,” which represent amounts in excess of our target hold for investment position.

The Company has well established lending guidelines and transaction parameters. We focus on transactions with established companies that have
strong market positions in targeted industry sectors. Our borrowers are typically unrated, but have credit profiles that we believe are comparable to
B1/B2/B3 rated companies due to their limited size and use of leverage. The Company’s preference is generally to finance acquisitions and other
productive uses of capital subject to structural parameters, such as maximum leverage, that can vary significantly depending on the facts and
circumstances of each situation. Substantially all the Company’s loans have significant lender protections, including financial covenants that are set at
levels with cushions to projected financial performance. They also typically include restrictive covenants and mandatory prepayment provisions that
limit borrowers’ ability to incur additional indebtedness and make acquisitions. Many transactions also include an excess cash flow recapture provision,
which is designed to accelerate debt repayment and de-leveraging.

NewStar is also selective in targeting transaction sponsors, focusing on more established firms with between $500 million and several billion
dollars of committed capital managed across multiple funds. The Company invests significant resources in developing relationships with target sponsors
and understanding their respective investment strategies, performance track records, access to capital, and industry focus, as well as the backgrounds of
their investment professionals. Our management believes that a significant factor in the Company’s success has been the quality of its private equity
franchise and the breadth of relationships it has developed with private equity firms. In many cases, the relationships that members of our management
have with investment professionals at these firms extend from early in their professional careers. We believe the value created by our private equity
relationships is reflected in the transaction flow that the Company generates and in the repeat business we have experienced with targeted sponsors.

NewStar’s origination and credit strategies are strongly influenced by industry dynamics. The Company has invested in the development of an
experienced staff of portfolio managers with deep industry expertise responsible for covering nine broad industry sectors. These portfolio managers
maintain extensive networks of industry contacts in their respective industries and employ a research-driven framework to develop insights into these
sectors intended to guide origination strategy and credit selection.

As of December 31, 2016, our Leveraged Finance loan portfolio (including the Arch Street loan portfolio) totaled $3.9 billion in funding
commitments and $3.6 billion in balances outstanding, representing 99.7% of our loan portfolio. This represented 388 transactions with an average
balance outstanding of approximately $9.3 million. During 2016, we originated $1.9 billion of new loans, of which we retained $1.1 billion and
originated $0.8 billion for credit funds. As of December 31, 2016, our exposure to energy (oil & gas) was approximately $41.1 million or 1.2% of
balance sheet assets.

Real Estate

We made the strategic decision to exit the real estate line of business in 2016 as we faced increased competition from banks and other lenders with
access to lower cost of funding. As of December 31, 2016 our Real Estate loan portfolio totaled $11.0 million in funding commitments and
$10.6 million in balances outstanding, representing 0.3% of our total loan portfolio. This represents our only remaining real estate lending relationship.
During 2016, we did not originate any new commercial real estate loans.

Asset Management

As a registered investment adviser, NewStar offers investment products for qualified institutions to invest in private credit funds managed by the
Company that employ credit oriented strategies, focused on middle market loans and liquid tradeable credit. Through its registered investment adviser
subsidiary, NewStar Capital, the Company also manages assets across a series of CLOs that invest primarily in broadly syndicated loans, as well as other
sponsored funds and managed accounts that invest across various liquid, non-investment grade asset classes, including broadly syndicated loans and
bonds.

The Company’s asset management activities provide important financial and strategic benefits. We earn management fees for our role as the
investment manager for funds that we manage. Compensation as investment manager is comprised of both base management fees and incentive fees. We
also enjoy important strategic benefits from the management of certain types of credit funds because they allow us to provide more capital to our
customers, while limiting our direct balance sheet risk. We believe this enhances our competitive position.

We believe that NewStar was among the first independent commercial finance companies to develop an asset management platform to provide
investment strategies targeting middle market loans. The Company launched its first fund in 2005, which was called NewStar Credit Opportunities Fund
(“NCOF”) to co-invest in loans originated by the Company. The fund was levered to support an investment portfolio of $600 million using bank credit
facilities to support the initial ramp-up followed by a securitization. The Company launched its second fund, the $300 million Arlington Fund in 2013. It
was increased to $400 million in 2014, and also employed leverage through a loan securitization. The Company closed its third fund, a $400 million
levered fund known as the Clarendon Fund in 2014, with an anchor equity investment from funds sponsored by Franklin Square and sub-advised by
GSO. The Company closed its fourth fund, a $505 million levered fund known as the Berkeley Fund during 2016.

In October 2015, we acquired Boston-based FOC Partners, a boutique credit manager and also a registered investment adviser. We operate FOC
Partners as a wholly owned subsidiary under the name NewStar Capital. NewStar Capital manages assets across a series of CLOs that invest primarily in
broadly syndicated loans, as well as other sponsored funds and managed accounts that invest across various liquid, non-investment grade asset classes,
including broadly syndicated loans and bonds. During 2016, NewStar Capital completed a $410 million broadly syndicated loan securitization known as
Arch Street.

The Company’s managed funds are allocated a portion of the middle market loans we originate based on an established allocation policy that
defines a set of rules for managing this activity. We are currently allocating loans to the Arlington, Berkeley and Clarendon Funds.

As of December 31, 2016, NewStar’s managed assets totaled $6.7 billion with $3.2 million managed within commercial lending, $1.3 billion
managed within asset management middle market direct lending and $2.2 billion within liquid, tradeable credit.

Our asset management income was approximately $13.4 million in 2016 and $6.7 million in 2015.

Loans and Other Debt Products

Senior secured cash flow loans

Our senior secured cash flow loans are provided by our Leveraged Finance group. We underwrite these loans based on the cash flow, profitability
and enterprise value of the borrower, with the value of any tangible assets as secondary protection. These loans are generally secured by a first-priority
security interest in all or substantially all of the borrowers’ assets and, in certain transactions, the pledge of their common stock.

As of December 31, 2016, senior secured cash flow loans totaled $3.7 billion in funding commitments and $3.4 billion in balances outstanding,
representing 93.6% of our loan portfolio.

Table of Contents

Senior secured asset-based loans

Our senior secured asset-based loans are secured by a first-priority lien on tangible assets and have a first-priority in right of payment. Senior
secured asset-based loans are typically advanced under revolving credit facilities against a borrowing base comprised of collateral, including eligible
accounts receivable, inventories and other long-term assets.

As of December 31, 2016, senior secured asset-based loans totaled $32.8 million in funding commitments and $29.2 million in balances
outstanding, representing 0.8% of our loan portfolio.

First mortgage loans

Our first mortgage loans are provided by our Real Estate group and are secured by a mortgage bearing a first lien on the real property serving as
collateral. Our first mortgage loans require borrowers to demonstrate satisfactory collateral value at closing through a third party property appraisal and
typically contain provisions governing the use of property operating cash flow and disbursement of loan proceeds during the term of the loan.

As of December 31, 2016, first mortgage loans totaled $11.0 million in funding commitments and $10.6 million in balances outstanding,
representing 0.3% of our loan portfolio.

Other

Our other loans and debt products are categorized as $110.9 million of senior subordinated asset-based (which are equal as to collateral and
subordinate as to right of payment to other senior lenders), $71.6 million of second lien (which are second liens on all or substantially all of a borrower’s
assets, and in some cases, junior in right of payment to senior lenders), and $6.6 million of mezzanine/subordinated (which are subordinated as to rights
to collateral and right of payment to senior lenders).

Loan Portfolio

The Company’s loan portfolio is comprised of loans, leases and other debt products. As of December 31, 2016, the loan portfolio totaled
approximately $3.9 billion of funding commitments, representing $3.6 billion of balances outstanding and $0.3 billion of funds committed but undrawn
as of December 31, 2016. Consistent with our strategy to focus on senior secured lending, first lien senior debt represented 94.7% of the portfolio.

As of December 31, 2016, we had 11 loans with outstanding balances greater than $25.0 million. In most of these cases, we either sought to
maximize our potential recovery of the outstanding principal by adding to our position through a workout or our hold size increased as a result of a
portfolio purchase, syndication or through asset management activities. As of December 31, 2016, we had one impaired loan that had an outstanding
balance greater than $20 million. As of December 31, 2016 our largest outstanding loan was 0.84% of our loan portfolio, and the top ten outstanding
loans comprised 7.6% of our loan portfolio.

Recent Developments

Dividend Policy

On February 14, 2017, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend. The first cash dividend of $0.02 per share is expected to be paid
on March 17, 2017 to stockholders of record on March 2, 2017. While it is the Company’s intention to pay quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable
future, the amount, timing and frequency of any future dividend payments remains in the discretion of our Board of Directors, taking into account our
financial condition and results of operation, our capital needs, market conditions and other factors that the board considers appropriate at the time. In
addition, the indenture governing our senior notes imposes certain limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock or to
make other restricted payments, including repurchasing our common stock. Such limitations are calculated in part by reference to our consolidated net
income, as calculated under the indenture. Our ability to declare dividends for future periods thus depends on both our earnings and the amount of prior
dividends, stock repurchases and other restricted payments.

Stock Repurchase Program

On December 9, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30.0 million of our common stock from time to time on the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares purchased under the repurchase program will be determined
by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The new repurchase program, commenced immediately following the
expiration of the prior stock repurchase program, which was authorized on October 7, 2015, amended on February 10, 2016 and expired on
December 31, 2016. The new repurchase program will expire on December 31, 2017 unless extended by the Board and may be suspended or
discontinued at any time without notice.

Sale of NewStar Equipment Finance assets and related platform

On December 1, 2016, the Company sold the assets of Equipment Finance and related platform to a third party and exited the business. The sale of
equipment finance portfolio was the result of the Company’s decision to exit businesses with economic models increasingly challenged by competition
from banks and other lenders with access to lower cost funding. The sale resulted in a gain of $6.7 million, before transaction related costs of
$4.3 million. The net gain is recorded in non-interest income on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. In connection with the sale of
the assets of Equipment Finance, the Company established a contingent liability to cover any potential credit indemnification costs resulting from actual
credit losses incurred on the assets sold.

Sale of NewStar Business Credit LLC

On March 31, 2016, the Company sold its asset based lending business, Business Credit to a third party. The Company opted to sell Business
Credit because it was faced with challenges from increasing competition with access to lower cost of funding. The sale resulted in a gain of
$22.5 million, before transaction related costs of $2.5 million. The net gain is recorded in non-interest income on the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations.

Competition

Our markets are highly competitive and are characterized by competitive factors that vary based upon product and geographic region. We
currently compete with a large number of financial services companies, including:
 

 •  specialty and commercial finance companies, including business development companies;
 

 •  private investment funds and hedge funds;
 

 •  national and regional banks;
 

 •  investment banks; and
 

 •  insurance companies.

The markets in which we operate are fragmented. We compete based on the following factors, which vary by industry, asset class and property
types:
 

 •  the interest rates and other pricing and/or loan or other debt product terms;
 

 •  the quality of our people and their relationships;
 

 •  our knowledge of our customers’ industries and business needs;
 

 •  the flexibility of our product offering;
 

 •  the responsiveness of our process; and
 

 •  our focus on customer service.

Regulation

Some aspects of our operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities and may be subject to
various laws and regulations imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things:
 

 •  regulate credit granting activities, including establishing licensing requirements in some jurisdictions;
 

 •  establish the maximum interest rates, finance charges and other fees we may charge our customers;

 •  govern secured transactions;
 

 •  require specified information disclosures to our customers;
 

 •  set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims handling customer procedures and other trade practices;
 

 •  regulate our customers’ insurance coverage;
 

 •  prohibit discrimination in the extension of credit and administration of our loans; and
 

 •  regulate the use and reporting of information related to a customer’s credit experience.

Many of our competitors are subject to more extensive supervision and regulation. If we were to become subject to similar supervision or
regulation in the future, it could impact our ability to conduct our business.

During 2012, we registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Adviser Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) as a result of SEC rules
promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Company and its investment
management subsidiary, NewStar Capital, are registered investment advisors. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment
advisers including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations and record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements. Registered investment advisers
are required by the SEC to adopt and implement written policies and procedures designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act and to designate a
chief compliance officer responsible for administering these policies and procedures. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose
sanctions for violations for the Advisers Act, which may include fines, censure or the suspension or termination of an investment adviser’s registration.

Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we employed 69 people compared to 122 people at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, our origination group
had 15 employees, including 9 bankers who were either managing directors, directors or vice presidents, and six associates and analysts. Our credit
organization had 15 employees, including eight managing directors. We employed 29 people who were involved in operational or administrative roles.
NewStar Capital employs 10 employees, including nine investment management professionals. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
We had 68 employees as of February 27, 2017.

The following are important risks and uncertainties we have identified that could materially affect our future results. You should consider them
carefully when evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report and otherwise made by us or on our behalf because these
contingencies could cause actual results and circumstances to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The Company’s
actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties discussed
below. If any of those contingencies actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted and the
trading price of our common stock could decline.

Risks Related to Our Loan Portfolio and Lending Activities

We may not recover all amounts contractually owed to us by our borrowers resulting in charge-offs, impairments and non-accruals, which
may exceed our allowance for credit losses and could negatively impact our financial results and our ability to secure additional funding.

We had net charge offs of $33.0 million of loans during 2016, and expect to have additional credit losses in the future through the normal course
of our lending operations. If we were to experience a material increase in credit losses exceeding our allowance for loan losses in the future, our assets,
net income and operating results would be adversely impacted, which could also lead to challenges in securing additional financing.

Like other commercial lenders, we experience delinquencies, impairments and non-accruals, which may indicate that our risk of credit loss for a
particular loan has materially increased. When a loan is over 90 days past due or if management believes it is probable that we will be unable to collect
principal and interest contractually owed to us, it is our policy to place the loan on non-accrual status and classify it as impaired. In certain
circumstances, a loan can be classified as impaired, but continue to be performing as a result of a troubled debt restructuring.

As of December 31, 2016, we had delinquent loans of $21.1 million and had loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $133.4 million
classified as impaired. Of these impaired loans, loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $99.2 million at December 31, 2016 were also on
non-accrual status. These non-accrual loans had a carrying value of $92.9 million before specific reserves.

As of December 31, 2016, we had an allowance for credit losses of $51.4 million, including specific reserves of $19.8 million. Management
periodically reviews the appropriateness of our allowance for credit losses. However, the history of our loans and leases makes it difficult to judge the
expected credit performance of our loans and leases, as it may not be predictive of future losses. Our estimates and judgments with respect to the
appropriateness of our allowance for credit losses may not be accurate, and the assumptions we use to make such estimates and judgments may not be
accurate. Moreover, the estimates and judgments we make regarding workout loans are more sensitive to our assumptions regarding the appropriateness
of our allowance for credit losses. Our allowance may not be adequate to cover credit or other losses related to our loans and leases as a result of
unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets. If we were to experience material
credit losses related to our loans, such losses could adversely impact our ability to fund future loans and our business and, to the extent losses exceed our
allowance for credit losses, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

We may have hold positions that exceed our targets which may result in more volatility in the performance of our loan portfolio.

Our loans and other debt products, which may be part of larger credit facilities, typically range in size from $15 million to $50 million, although
we generally limit the size of the loans that we retain to $25 million. In certain cases, however, our loans and debt products exceed $35 million. We also
have the capability to arrange

significantly larger transactions that we syndicate to other lenders, including funds that we manage. As a result of syndication and asset management
activities, our exposure to certain loans and other debt products will exceed $35 million from time to time through “Loans held-for-sale,” which
represent amounts in excess of our target hold for investment position. As of December 31, 2016, we had 11 loans that had an outstanding balance
greater than $25 million. In each of these cases, we either sought to maximize our potential recovery of the outstanding principal by adding to our
position through a workout or our hold size increased as a result of a portfolio purchase, syndication or through asset management activities. As of
December 31, 2016, we had one impaired loan that had an outstanding balance greater than $20 million. If a borrower in one of these larger hold
positions were to experience difficulty in adhering to the repayment terms of its loan with us, the negative impact to our results of operations and
financial condition could be greater than a loan within our general size limits.

Disruptions in global financial markets have in the past increased, and may in the future cause, additional charge-offs, impairments and
non-accruals in our loan portfolio, which may exceed our allowance for credit losses and could negatively impact our financial results.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the economic and business conditions in the markets in
which we operate. Delinquencies, non-accruals and credit losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Our loan portfolio
primarily consists of loans and leases to medium-sized businesses that may be particularly susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be
unable to make scheduled payments of interest or principal on their borrowings during these periods. Therefore, to the extent that economic and business
conditions are or become unfavorable, our non-performing assets are likely to remain elevated and the value of our loan portfolio is likely to decrease.
Adverse economic conditions also may decrease the estimated value of the collateral, securing some of our loans or other debt products. Further or
prolonged economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our loan portfolio and a decrease in our net interest income, net income
and book value.

We make loans primarily to privately-owned, medium-sized companies that may carry more inherent risk and present an increased potential
for loss than loans to larger companies.

Our loan portfolio consists primarily of loans to medium-sized, privately-owned companies, most of which do not publicly report their financial
condition. Compared to larger, publicly-traded firms, loans to these types of companies may carry more inherent risk. The companies that we lend to
generally have more limited access to capital and higher funding costs, may be in a weaker financial position, may need more capital to expand or
compete, and may be unable to obtain financing from public capital markets or from traditional sources, such as commercial banks. Accordingly, loans
and leases made to these types of customers involve higher risks than loans and leases made to companies that have larger businesses, greater financial
resources or are otherwise able to access traditional credit sources. Numerous factors may make these types of companies more vulnerable to variations
in results of operations, changes impacting their industry and changes in general market conditions. Companies in this market segment also face intense
competition, including from companies with greater financial, technical, managerial and marketing resources. Any of these factors could impair a
customer’s cash flow or result in other adverse events, such as bankruptcy, which could limit a customer’s ability to make scheduled payments on our
loans and leases, and may lead to losses in our loan portfolio and a decrease in our net interest income, net income and book value.

Additionally, because most of our customers do not publicly report their financial condition, we are more susceptible to a customer’s fraud, which
could cause us to suffer losses on our loan portfolio. The failure of a customer to accurately report its financial position, compliance with loan covenants
or eligibility for additional borrowings could result in our providing loans, leases or other debt products that do not meet our underwriting criteria,
defaults in loan and lease payments, the loss of some or all of the principal of a particular loan or loans, including, in the case of revolving loans,
amounts we may not have advanced had we possessed complete and accurate information.

Our concentration of loans and other debt products within a particular industry or region could impair our financial condition or results of
operations if that industry or region were to experience adverse changes to economic or business conditions.

We specialize in certain broad industry segments, such as business services, industrial, manufacturing and healthcare in which our bankers have
experience and strong networks of proprietary deal sources and our credit personnel have significant underwriting expertise. As a result, our portfolio
currently has and may develop other concentrations of risk exposure related to those industry segments. If industry segments in which we have a
concentration of investment experience adverse economic or business conditions, our delinquencies, default rate and loan charge-offs in those segments
may increase, which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Our balloon and bullet transactions may involve a greater degree of risk than other types of loans.

As of December 31, 2016, balloon and bullet transactions represented 82.6% of the outstanding balance of our loan portfolio. Balloon and bullet
loans involve a greater degree of risk than other types of transactions because they are structured to allow for either small (balloon) or no (bullet)
principal payments over the term of the loan, requiring the borrower to make a large final payment upon the maturity of the loan. The ability of our
customers to make this final payment upon the maturity of the loan typically depends upon their ability either to refinance the loan prior to maturity or to
generate sufficient cash flow to repay the loan at maturity. The ability of a customer to accomplish any of these goals will be affected by many factors,
including the availability of financing at acceptable rates to the customer, the financial condition of the customer, the marketability of the related
collateral, the operating history of the related business, tax laws and the prevailing general economic conditions. Consequently, the customer may not
have the ability to repay the loan at maturity, and we could lose all or most of the principal of our loan. Given their relative size and limited resources
and access to capital, our small and mid-sized customers may have difficulty in repaying or financing their balloon and bullet loans on a timely basis or
at all.

Our cash flow transactions are not fully covered by the value of tangible assets or collateral of the customer and, consequently, if any of these
transactions become non-performing, we could suffer a loss of some or all of our value in the assets.

Cash flow lending involves lending money to a customer based primarily on the expected cash flow, profitability and enterprise value of a
customer, with the value of any tangible assets as secondary protection. In some cases, these loans may have more leverage than traditional bank debt.
As of December 31, 2016, cash flow transactions comprised $3.4 billion, or 93.6%, of the outstanding balance of our loan portfolio. In the case of our
senior cash flow loans, we generally take a lien on substantially all of a customer’s assets, but the value of those assets is typically substantially less than
the amount of money we advance to the customer under a cash flow transaction. In addition, some of our cash flow loans may be viewed as stretch
loans, meaning they may be at leverage multiples that exceed traditional accepted bank lending standards for senior cash flow loans. Thus, if a cash flow
transaction becomes non-performing, our primary recourse to recover some or all of the principal of our loan or other debt product would be to force the
sale of all or part of the company as a going concern. Additionally, we may obtain equity ownership in a borrower as a means to recover some or all of
the principal of our loan. The risks inherent in cash flow lending include, among other things:
 

 
•  reduced use of or demand for the customer’s products or services and, thus, reduced cash flow of the customer to service the loan and other

debt product as well as reduced value of the customer as a going concern;
 

 •  inability of the customer to manage working capital, which could result in lower cash flow;
 

 •  inaccurate or fraudulent reporting of our customer’s positions or financial statements;

Table of Contents

 
•  economic downturns, political events, regulatory changes, litigation or acts of terrorism that affect the customer’s business, financial

condition and prospects; and
 

 •  our customer’s poor management of their business.

Additionally, many of our customers use the proceeds of our cash flow transactions to make acquisitions. Poorly executed or poorly conceived
acquisitions can tax management, systems and the operations of the existing business, causing a decline in both the customer’s cash flow and the value
of its business as a going concern. In addition, many acquisitions involve new management teams taking over control of a business. These new
management teams may fail to execute at the same level as the former management team, which could reduce the cash flow of the customer available to
service the loan or other debt product, as well as reduce the value of the customer as a going concern.

If interest rates rise, demand for our loans or other debt products may decrease and some of our existing customers may be unable to service
interest on their loans or other debt products.

Most of our loans and other debt products bear interest at floating interest rates subject to floors. To the extent interest rates increase, monthly
interest obligations owed by our customers to us will also increase. Demand for our loans or other debt products may decrease as interest rates rise or if
interest rates are expected to rise in the future. In addition, if prevailing interest rates increase, some of our customers may not be able to make the
increased interest payments or refinance their balloon and bullet transaction, resulting in payment defaults and loan impairments. Conversely if interest
rates decline, our customers may refinance the loans they have with us at lower interest rates, or with others, leading to lower revenues.

Errors by, or dishonesty of, our employees in making credit decisions or in our loan and other debt product servicing activities could result in
credit losses and harm our reputation.

We rely heavily on the performance and integrity of our employees in making our initial credit decisions with respect to our loans and other debt
products and in servicing our loans and other debt products after they have closed. Because there is generally little or no publicly available information
about our customers, we cannot independently confirm or verify the information our employees provide us for use in making our credit and funding
decisions. Errors by our employees in assembling, analyzing or recording information concerning our customers could cause us to originate loans or
fund subsequent advances that we would not otherwise originate or fund, which could result in loan losses. Losses could also arise if any of our
employees were dishonest, particularly if they colluded with a customer to misrepresent the creditworthiness of a prospective customer or to provide
inaccurate reports regarding the customer’s compliance with the covenants in its loan or other debt products agreement. If, based on an employee’s
dishonesty, we made a loan or other debt product to a customer that was not creditworthy or failed to exercise our rights under a loan or other debt
product agreement against a customer that was not in compliance with covenants in the agreement, we could lose some or all of the principal of the loan
or other debt product. Fraud or dishonesty on the part of our employees could also damage our reputation which could harm our competitive position
and adversely affect our business.

We are not the sole lender or agent for most of our leveraged finance loans or other debt products. Consequently, we do not have absolute
control over how these loans or other debt products are administered or have control over those loans. When we are not the sole lender or agent, we
may be required to seek approvals from other lenders before we take actions to enforce our rights.

Our loan originations are comprised of a larger percentage of broadly syndicated deals. As such, a majority of our loan portfolio consists of loans
and other debt products in which we are neither the sole lender, the agent for the lending group that receives payments under the loan or other debt
product nor the agent that controls the underlying collateral. These loans may not include the same covenants that we generally require of our borrowers.
For these loans and other debt products, we may not have direct access to the customer and, as a

result, may not receive the same financial or operational information as we receive for loans or other debt products for which we are the agent. This may
make it more difficult for us to track or rate these loans or other debt products. Additionally, we may be prohibited or otherwise restricted from taking
actions to enforce the loan or other debt product or to foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan or other debt product without the agreement of
other lenders holding a specified minimum aggregate percentage, generally a majority or two-thirds of the outstanding principal balance. It is possible
that an agent for one of these loans or other debt products may choose not to take the same actions to enforce the loan or other debt product or to
foreclose upon the collateral securing the loan that we would have taken had we been the agent for the loan or other debt product.

Our commitments to lend additional sums to customers may exceed our resources available to fund these commitments, adversely affecting
our financial condition and results of operations.

Our contractual commitments to lend additional sums to our customers may exceed our resources available to fund these commitments. Some of
our funding sources are only available to fund a portion of a loan and other funding sources may not be immediately available. Our customers’ ability to
borrow these funds may be restricted until they are able to demonstrate, among other things, that they have sufficient collateral to secure the requested
additional borrowings or that the borrowing conforms to specific uses or meets certain conditions. We may have miscalculated the likelihood that our
customers will request additional borrowings in excess of our readily available funds. If our calculations prove incorrect, we will not have the funds to
make these loan advances without obtaining additional financing. Our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our
customers could create breach of contract or other liabilities for us and damage our reputation in the marketplace, which could then adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations.

Because there is no active trading market for most of the loans and other debt products in our loan portfolio, we might not be able to sell them
at a favorable price or at all. The lack of active secondary markets for some of our investments may also create uncertainty as to the value of these
investments.

We may seek to dispose of one or more of our loans and other debt products to obtain liquidity or to reduce or limit potential losses with respect to
non-performing assets. There is no established trading market for most of our loans and other debt products. In addition, the fair value of other debt
products that have lower levels of liquidity or are not publicly-traded may not be readily determinable and may fluctuate significantly on a monthly,
quarterly and annual basis. Because these valuations are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates,
our determinations of the fair value of our other debt products may differ materially from the values that we ultimately attain for these debt products or
would be able to attain if we have to sell our other debt products. Our determinations regarding the fair value of these investments may be materially
higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal. In addition, given the limited trading market for our loans and other debt products
and the uncertainty as to their fair value at any point in time, if we seek to sell a loan or other debt product to obtain liquidity or reduce or limit losses,
we may not be able to do so at a favorable price or at all.

We selectively underwrite transactions that we may be unable to syndicate or sell to our credit funds.

On a selective basis, we commit to underwrite transactions that are significantly larger than our internal hold targets and we then seek to syndicate
amounts in excess of our target to other lenders or plan to season the loan on our balance sheet to satisfy tax requirements and then sell the excess
amounts to our credit funds. If we are unable to syndicate or sell these commitments, we may have to sell the additional exposure to third parties on
unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we must hold a larger portion of a
transaction than we would like, we may not be able to complete other transactions and our loan portfolio may become more concentrated, which could
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Table of Contents

We provide second lien, subordinated / mezzanine loans, other debt products and equity-linked products that may rank junior to rights of other
lenders, representing a higher risk of loss than our other loans and debt products in which we have a first priority position.

Although our loans are usually senior in right of payment, we also provide second lien, subordinated / mezzanine loans, other debt products and
equity-linked products, which are often junior in right of payment to obligations to customers’ senior secured lenders and contain either junior or no
collateral rights. As a result of their junior nature, we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights to collect principal and interest on these loans
and other debt products or to recover any of their outstanding balance through a foreclosure of collateral. For example, typically we are not contractually
entitled to receive payments of principal on a junior loan or other debt product until the senior loan or other debt product is paid in full, and we may only
receive interest payments on a second lien or subordinated / mezzanine asset if the customer is not in default under its senior secured loan. In many
instances, we are also prohibited from foreclosing on collateral securing a second lien, subordinated / mezzanine loan or other debt product until the
senior loan is paid in full. Moreover, any amounts that we might realize as a result of our collection efforts or in connection with a bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding involving a customer under a second lien, subordinated / mezzanine loan or other debt product must generally be turned over to
the senior secured lender until the senior secured lender has realized the full value of its own claims. These restrictions may materially and adversely
affect our ability to recover the principal of any non-performing senior subordinate, second lien, subordinated / mezzanine loans and other debt product.
In addition, on occasion we provide senior loans or other debt products that are contractually subordinated to one or more senior secured loans for the
customer. In those cases, we may have a first lien security interest, but one or more creditors have payment priority over us. As of December 31, 2016,
our second lien and, subordinated/mezzanine loans totaled $78.2 million.

Risks Related to Our Funding and Leverage

Our ability to grow our business depends on our ability to obtain external financing. If our lenders terminate any of our credit facilities or if
we default on our credit facilities, we may not be able to continue to fund our business.

We require a substantial amount of cash to provide new loans and other debt products and to fund our obligations to existing customers. In the
past, we have obtained the cash required for our operations through the issuance of equity interests and by borrowing money through credit facilities,
term debt securitizations, the issuance of senior notes and subordinated notes, and repurchase agreements. We may not be able to continue to access
these or other sources of funds.

During 2016, we completed a term debt securitization of $348.0 million and a $409.8 million broadly syndicated loan securitization. We also
increased the commitment amount of one of our credit facilities to fund leveraged finance loans from $475.0 million to $615.0 million. We called a term
debt securitization and redeemed the notes at par. In connection with the sale of Business Credit and the assets of Equipment Finance and the related
platform, we repaid three of our credit facilities. Additionally, we used the net proceed of the broadly syndicated loan securitization to repay a credit
facility that was used to provided transitional financing during the warehouse phase of the securitization.

Our credit facilities contain customary representations and warranties, covenants, conditions, events of default and termination events that if
breached, not satisfied or triggered, could result in termination of the facility. These events of default and termination events include, but are not limited
to, failure to service debt obligations, failure to meet liquidity covenants and tangible net worth covenants, and failure to remain within prescribed
facility portfolio delinquency and charge-off levels. Further, all cash flow generated by our loans and other debt products subject to a particular facility
would go to pay down our borrowings thereunder rather than to us if we are in default. Additionally, if the facility were terminated due to our breach,
noncompliance or default, our lenders could liquidate or sell all or a portion of our loans and other debt products held in that facility. Also, if we trigger
a default or there is a termination event under one facility, or a default under our outstanding notes,

and that default or termination results in a payment default or in the acceleration of that facility’s debt or the applicable notes, it may trigger a default or
termination event under our other facilities that have cross-acceleration or payment cross-default provisions. Consequently, if one or more of these
facilities were to terminate prior to its expected maturity date, our liquidity position would be materially adversely affected, and we may not be able to
satisfy our undrawn commitment balances, originate new loans or other debt products or continue to fund our operations. Even if we are able to
refinance our debt, we may not be able to do so on favorable terms. If we are not able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms or at all, our
ability to grow our business will be impaired.

Our deferred financing fees amortize over the contractual life of credit facilities and over the weighted average expected life of our term debt
securitizations.

We have recorded deferred financing fees associated with most of our financing facilities. These deferred financing fees amortize over the
contractual life of our credit facilities and over the weighted average expected life of our term debt securitizations. If a credit facility were to terminate
before its contractual maturity date or if a term debt securitization were to terminate before its weighted average expected life, we would be required to
accelerate amortization of the remaining balance of the deferred financing fees which could have a negative impact our results of operations and
financial condition.

Our lenders and noteholders could terminate us as servicer of our loans, which would adversely affect our ability to manage our loan portfolio
and reduce our net interest income.

Upon the occurrence of specified servicer termination events, our lenders under our credit facilities and the holders of the notes issued in our term
debt securitizations may elect to terminate our role as servicer of the loans and other debt products under the applicable facility and appoint a successor
servicer. These servicer termination events include, but are not limited to, maintenance of certain financial covenants and the loss of certain key
members of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer. We do not maintain key man life insurance on
any of our senior management nor have we taken any other precautions to offset the financial loss we could incur as a result of any of their departures.
Certain of our credit facilities include cure rights which would enable us to correct the event of default and maintain our status as servicer.

If we are terminated as servicer, we will no longer receive our servicing fee, but we will continue to receive the excess interest rate spread as long
as the term debt securitization does not need to trap the excess spread as a result of defaulted loan collateral. In addition, because any successor servicer
may not be able to service our loan portfolio according to our standards, any transfer of servicing to a successor servicer could result in reduced or
delayed collections, delays in processing payments and information regarding the loans and other debt products and a failure to meet all of the servicing
procedures required by the applicable servicing agreement. Consequently, the performance of our loans and other debt products could be adversely
affected and our income generated from those loans and other debt products significantly reduced.

Our liquidity position could be adversely affected if we were unable to complete additional term debt securitizations in the future, or if the
reinvestment periods in our term debt securitizations terminate early, which could create a material adverse affect on our financial condition and
results of operations.

We have completed ten middle market term debt securitizations and one broadly syndicated securitization to fund our loans and other debt
products, all of which we accounted for on our balance sheet. Seven of these balance sheet securitizations were outstanding as of December 31, 2016.
Our term debt securitizations consist of asset securitization transactions in which we transfer loans and other debt products to a trust that aggregates our
loans and, in turn, sells notes, collateralized by the trust’s assets, to institutional investors. The notes issued by the trusts have been rated by nationally
recognized statistical rating organizations. At December 31, 2016, the ratings range from AAA to B by Standard & Poor’s, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc.
and Aaa to B2 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., depending on the class of notes.

We intend to complete additional term debt securitizations in the future. Several factors will affect demand for, and our ability to complete,
additional term debt securitizations, including:
 

 •  disruptions in the capital markets generally, and the asset-backed securities market in particular;
 

 
•  disruptions in the credit quality and performance of our loan portfolio, particularly that portion which has been previously securitized and

serves as collateral for existing term debt securitizations;
 

 •  regulatory considerations;
 

 •  changes in rating agency methodology;
 

 
•  our ability to service our loan portfolio and that ability continuing to be perceived as adequate to make the issued securities attractive to

investors; and
 

 •  any material downgrading or withdrawal of ratings given to securities previously issued in our term debt securitizations.

If we are unable to complete additional term debt securitizations, our ability to obtain the capital needed for us to continue to operate and grow our
business would be adversely affected. In addition, our credit facilities are only intended to provide short-term financing for our transactions. If we are
unable to finance our transactions over the longer term through our term debt securitizations, our credit facilities may not be renewed. Moreover, our
credit facilities typically carry a higher interest rate than our term debt securitizations. Accordingly, our inability to complete additional term debt
securitizations in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Market Conditions.”

If a specified default event occurred in a term debt securitization, the reinvestment period would be terminated. This could have an adverse effect
on our ability to fund new assets.

The cash flows we receive from the interests we retain in our term debt securitizations could be delayed or reduced due to the requirements of
the term debt securitization.

We have retained 100% of the junior-most interests issued in our balance sheet term debt securitizations, totaling $446.7 million in principal
amount, issued in each of our seven outstanding balance sheet term debt securitizations as of December 31, 2016. The notes issued in the term debt
securitizations that we did not retain are senior to the junior-most interests we did retain. Our receipt of future cash flows on the junior-most interests is
governed by provisions that control the distribution of cash flows from the loans and other debt products included in our term debt securitizations. On a
quarterly basis, interest cash flows from the loans and other debt products must first be used to pay the interest on the senior notes and expenses of the
term debt securitization. Any funds remaining after the payment of these amounts are distributed to us.

Several factors may influence the timing and amount of the cash flows we receive from loans and other debt products included in our term debt
securitizations, including:
 

 

•  if any loan or other debt product included in a term debt securitization becomes (a) delinquent for a specified period of time as outlined in
the indenture, (b) is classified as a non-performing asset, or (c) is charged off, all funds, after paying expenses and interest to the senior
notes, go to a reserve account which then pays down an amount of senior notes equal to the amount of the delinquent loan or other debt
product or if an overcollateralization test is present, is diverted, and used to de-lever the securitization to bring the ratio back into
compliance. Except for specified senior management fees, we will not receive any distributions from funds during this period; and

 

 
•  if other specified events occur to the trusts, for example an event of default, our cash flows would be used to reduce the outstanding balance

of the senior notes and would not be available to us until the full principal balance of the senior notes had been repaid.

We have obtained a significant portion of our debt financing through a limited number of financial institutions. This concentration of funding
sources exposes us to funding risks.

We have obtained our credit facility financing from a limited number of financial institutions. Our reliance on the underwriters of our debt
financing and their affiliates for a significant amount of our funding exposes us to funding risks. If these participating lenders decided to terminate our
credit facilities, we would need to establish new lending relationships to satisfy our funding needs.

We bear the risk of loss for off balance sheet obligations.

The term “off-balance sheet risk” refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on our balance sheet, may result in
future obligation or loss. We are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of
our borrowers, including unfunded commitments and standby letters of credit. In addition, we enter into derivative instruments and hedging activities
from time to time that are not on our balance that also subject us to off-balance sheet risk.

Risks Related to Our Operations and Financial Results

Our quarterly net interest income and results of operations are difficult to forecast and may fluctuate substantially.

Our quarterly net interest income and results of operations are difficult to forecast. We have experienced and may continue to experience
substantial fluctuations in net interest income and results of operations from quarter to quarter. You should not rely on our results of operations in any
prior reporting period to be indicative of our performance in future reporting periods. Many different factors could cause our results of operations to
vary from quarter to quarter, including:
 

 •  the success of our origination activities;
 

 •  pre-payments on our loan portfolio;
 

 •  credit losses on recent transaction and legacy workouts;
 

 •  default rates;
 

 •  our ability to enter into financing arrangements;
 

 •  competition;
 

 •  seasonal fluctuations in our business, including the timing of transactions;
 

 •  costs of compliance with regulatory requirements;
 

 •  private equity activity;
 

 •  the timing and effect of any future acquisitions;
 

 •  personnel changes;
 

 •  changes in accounting rules;
 

 •  changes in allowance for credit losses methodology;
 

 •  changes in prevailing interest rates;
 

 •  general changes to the U.S. and global economies;
 

 •  political conditions or events; and
 

 •  LIBOR floors.

Table of Contents

We base our current and future operating expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future net interest income, transaction activity
and rate of growth. The majority of our loans have LIBOR floors; until the 90 day LIBOR exceeds the level of these floors our net interest margin will
be negatively impacted during the early phase of a rising interest rate environment. We expect that our expenses will increase in the future, and we may
not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our net interest income falls short of our expectations. Any shortfalls in our net interest income or in
our expected growth rates would adversely impact our results of operations and could result in decreases in our stock price.

Our business is highly dependent on key personnel.

Our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Investment Officer as
well as other key personnel. Our employment agreements with each of these officers will terminate in October of 2018. If we were to lose the services of
any of these executives for any reason, including voluntary resignation or retirement, we may not be able to replace them with someone of equal skill or
ability and our business may be adversely affected. Moreover, we may not function well without the continued services of these executives.

We may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business.

Our ability to originate and underwrite loans and other debt products is dependent on the experience and expertise of our employees. In order to
grow our business, we must attract and retain qualified personnel, especially origination and credit personnel who have relationships with referral
sources and an understanding of middle-market businesses and the industries in which our borrowers operate. Many of the financial institutions with
which we compete for experienced personnel may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. If any of our key origination personnel leave,
our new loan and other debt product volume from their business contacts may decline or cease, regardless of the terms of our loan and other debt
product offerings or our level of service. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to
competitors who may seek to recruit them and increases the costs of retaining them. As competition for qualified employees grows, our cost of labor
could increase, which could adversely impact our results of operations.

Maintenance of our Investment Company Act exemption imposes limits on our operations.

We intend to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended, which we refer to as the Investment Company Act. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines as an investment company
any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes
to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40.0% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash
items) on an unconsolidated basis. Excluded from the term “investment securities” are, among other things, securities issued by majority-owned
subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company in
Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.

We expect that many of our majority-owned subsidiaries, including those which we have created (or may in the future create) in connection with
our term debt securitizations, will rely on exceptions and exemptions from the Investment Company Act available to certain structured finance
companies and that our interests in those subsidiaries will not constitute “investment securities” for purposes of the Investment Company Act. Because
these exceptions and exemptions may, among other things, limit the types of assets these subsidiaries may purchase or counterparties with which we
may deal, we must monitor each subsidiary’s compliance with its applicable exception or exemption.

We must also monitor our loan portfolio to ensure that the value of the investment securities we hold does not exceed 40.0% of our total assets
(exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated

basis. If the combined value of the investment securities issued by our subsidiaries that are investment companies or that must rely on the exceptions
provided by Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act rather than another exception or exemption, together with any other
investment securities we may own, exceeds 40.0% of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis, we may be deemed to be an investment company.
Because we believe that the interests we hold in our subsidiaries generally will not be investment securities, we do not expect to own nor do we propose
to acquire investment securities in excess of 40.0% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis. We monitor for compliance with the
Investment Company Act on an ongoing basis and may be compelled to take or refrain from taking actions, to acquire additional income or loss
generating assets or to forgo opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial or advisable, including, but not limited to selling assets that are considered
to be investment securities or foregoing sale of assets which are not investment securities, in order to ensure that we (or a subsidiary) may continue to
rely on the applicable exceptions or exemptions. These limitations on our freedom of action could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

If we fail to maintain an exemption, exception or other exclusion from registration as an investment company, we could, among other things, be
required to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations either to avoid being required to register as an investment company or
to register as an investment company. If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become
subject to substantial regulation with respect to, among other things, our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management,
operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to
diversification and industry concentration, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If we did not register despite
being required to do so, criminal and civil actions could be brought against us, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court was to require
enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business. In addition, we may be required to prepay certain of
our indebtedness if we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

A decline in the growth of our funds or an increase in the amount of transaction and advisory fees we share with our fund investors could
result in a reduction in our management fee revenue.

Many factors could cause a decline in the growth of our asset management business, including the ability of our investment professionals to
identify attractive investment opportunities, decreased availability of capital on attractive terms, increased regulatory of legal oversight, or a turndown in
the U.S. or global economy any of which may significantly limit our ability to grow our asset management business and generate fee revenue.

Full realization of asset management fee income is dependent upon the performance of underlying funds.

We earn both base management fees and incentive fees on our managed funds. While the base fee is calculated as a percentage of assets managed,
the incentive fees are based upon the performance of the individual funds. Economic conditions along with other factors beyond our control may impact
our ability to earn these incentive fees.

We are in a highly competitive business and may not be able to compete effectively, which could impact our profitability.

The commercial lending industry is highly competitive and includes a number of competitors who provide similar types of loans to our target
customers. Our principal competitors include a variety of:
 

 •  specialty and commercial finance companies, including business development companies and real estate investment trusts;
 

 •  private investment funds and hedge funds;
 

 •  national and regional banks;

Table of Contents

 •  investment banks; and
 

 •  insurance companies.

Some of our competitors offer a broader range of financial, lending and banking services than we do and can leverage their existing customer
relationships to offer and sell services that compete directly with our products and services. In addition, some of our competitors have greater financial,
technical, marketing, origination and other resources than we do. They may also have greater access to capital than we do and at a lower cost than is
available to us. For example, if national and regional banks or other large competitors seek to expand within or enter our target markets, they may
provide loans at lower interest rates to gain market share, which could force us to lower our rates and result in decreased returns. As a result of
competition, we may not be able to attract new customers, retain existing customers or sustain the rate of growth that we have experienced to date, and
our ability to expand our loan portfolio and grow future revenue may decline. If our existing clients choose to use competing sources of credit to
refinance their debt, our loan portfolio could be adversely affected.

We are subject to regulation, which limits our activities and exposes us to additional fines and penalties, and any changes in such regulations
could affect our business and our profitability.

We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern non-depository commercial lenders and businesses generally. In
response to SEC rules promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act, we have registered with the SEC as an investment adviser and conformed our activities
to regulation under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with
many aspects of financial services, including the authority to grant, and, in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular
businesses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions,
including revocation of any registration that we may be required to hold. Even if a sanction imposed against us or our personnel is small in monetary
amount, the adverse publicity arising from the imposition of sanctions against us by regulators could harm our reputation and impair our ability to retain
clients and develop new client relationships, which may reduce our revenues.

Furthermore, the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to further modifications and regulation. Any changes in such laws or
regulations could affect our business and profitability. In addition, if we expand our business into areas or jurisdictions that are subject to, or have
adopted, more stringent laws and regulations than those that are currently applicable to us and our business, we may have to incur significant additional
expense or restrict our operations in order to comply, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations or prospects.

The asset management business is very competitive; we face competition in the pursuit of capital for our funds and in sourcing attractive yielding
assets for our managed funds. It is possible that we may experience difficulty in raising capital as funds compete for a limited number of qualified
investors. Economic downturns, poor returns in alternative assets and increased volatility may temporarily stop new fund investments, resulting in a
smaller pool of available capital. This may cause investors to seek or negotiate reduced fee structures or other modifications to our fund structures
before making an investment.

Our common stock may continue to have a volatile public trading price.

Historically, the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile, and the market for our common stock has experienced significant
price and volume fluctuations, some of which are unrelated to our company’s operating performance. Since our common stock began trading publicly in
2006, the trading price of our stock has fluctuated from a high of $20.85 to a low of $0.61. It is likely that the market price of our common stock will
continue to fluctuate in the future. Factors which may have a significant adverse effect on our common stock’s market price include:
 

 •  the rate of charge-offs, impairments and non-accruals in our loan portfolio;

based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance. The following information in this Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K is not deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C under the Securities Exchange Act of

Dividend Policy

On February 14, 2017, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend. The first cash dividend of $0.02 per share is expected to be paid
on March 17, 2017 to stockholders of record on March 2, 2017. While it is the Company’s intention to pay quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable
future, the amount, timing and frequency of any future dividend payments remains in the discretion of our Board of Directors, taking into account our
financial condition and results of operation, our capital needs, market conditions and other factors that the board considers appropriate at the time. In
addition, the indenture governing our senior notes imposes certain limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock or to
make other restricted payments, including repurchasing our common stock. Such limitations are calculated in part by reference to our consolidated net
income, as calculated under the indenture. Our ability to declare dividends for future periods thus depends on both our earnings and the amount of prior
dividends, stock repurchases and other restricted payments.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Important factors that may cause actual results and circumstances to differ
materially from those described in such statements are contained below and in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this report.

Overview

NewStar Financial, Inc. is an internally-managed, commercial finance company with $6.7 billion of assets managed across two complementary
business lines- middle market direct lending and asset management. The Company’s direct lending activities are focused on meeting the complex
financing needs of companies and private investors in the middle market through by offering a range of flexible debt financing options. Credit
investments are originated directly through teams of experienced, senior bankers organized around key industry and market segments. Through its asset
management platforms, NewStar offers a range of investment products employing credit-oriented strategies focused on middle market loans and liquid,
tradeable credit. The Company manages approximately $1.3 billion of assets in a series of private credit funds that co-invest in middle market loans
originated through its established leveraged finance lending platform and its strategic relationship with GSO Capital, the credit division of The
Blackstone Group. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NewStar Capital, the Company also has more than $2 billion of assets managed across a series
of CLOs that invest primarily in broadly syndicated, non-investment grade loans, as well as other sponsored funds and managed accounts that invest
across various asset classes, including non-investment grade loans and bonds.

We target our marketing and origination efforts at private equity firms, mid-sized companies, corporate executives, banks and a variety of other
referral sources and financial intermediaries to develop new customer relationships and source lending opportunities. Our origination network is national
in scope and we target companies with business operations across a broad range of industry sectors. We employ highly experienced bankers and credit
professionals to identify and structure new lending opportunities and manage customer relationships. We believe that the quality of our professionals,
the breadth of their relationships and referral networks, and their ability to develop creative solutions for customers position us to be a valued partner
and preferred lender for mid-sized companies and private equity funds with middle market investment strategies.

Our emphasis on direct origination is an important aspect of our marketing and credit strategy. Our national network is designed around
specialized origination channels intended to generate a large set of potential lending opportunities. That allows us to be highly selective in our credit
process and to allocate capital to market segments that we believe represent the most attractive opportunities. Our direct origination network also
generates proprietary lending opportunities with yield characteristics that we believe would not otherwise be available through intermediaries. In
addition, direct origination provides us with direct access to management teams and enhances our ability to conduct detailed due diligence and credit
analysis of prospective borrowers. It also allows us to negotiate transaction terms directly with borrowers and, as a result, advise our customers’
financial strategies and capital structures, which we believe benefits our credit performance.

The Company typically provides financing commitments to companies in amounts that range in size from $15 million to $50 million. The size of
financing commitments depends on various factors, including the type of loan, the credit characteristics of the borrower, the economic characteristics of
the loan, and our role in the transaction. We also selectively arrange larger transactions that we may retain on our balance sheet or syndicate to other
lenders, which may include funds that we manage for third party institutional investors. By syndicating loans to other lenders and our managed funds,
we are able to provide larger financing commitments to our customers and generate fee income, while limiting our risk exposure to single borrowers.
From time to time, however, our balance sheet exposure to a single borrower will exceed $25 million and we currently have 11 loans in that category.

Beginning in January 2016, the Company’s operations were divided into two reportable segments that represent its core businesses, Commercial
Lending and Asset Management.

The Commercial Lending segment represents our middle market direct lending activities which are focused on providing a range of flexible senior
secured debt options to mid-sized companies with annual cash flow (EBITDA) typically between $15 million and $50 million owned by private equity
investment funds and managed by established professional alternative asset managers.

The Asset Management segment represents our investment advisory activities which are focused on providing opportunities for qualified investors
to invest in a range of credit funds managed by the Company. The Asset Management segment manages a series of private credit funds that co-invest in
middle market loans originated through its established direct lending platform. Additionally, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NewStar Capital, the
Company also manages assets across a series of CLOs that invest primarily in broadly syndicated loans, as well as other sponsored funds and managed
accounts that invest across various liquid, non-investment grade asset classes, including broadly syndicated loans and bonds.

Market Conditions

Market conditions in our primary target loan market were mixed in the fourth quarter of 2016 as middle market loan volume increased and pricing
decreased, each as compared to the third quarter of 2016. According to Thomson Reuters, overall middle market loan volume in the fourth quarter was
$39 billion versus $36 billion last quarter and versus $40 billion in the same period in 2015. Total middle market loan volume for 2016 was $139 billion
versus $143 billion in 2015. The volume represented by new middle market transactions, as opposed to refinancing transactions, increased in the fourth
quarter to $21 billion from $19 billion in the prior quarter and from $16 billion in the same quarter in 2015. Refinancing volume increased in the fourth
quarter of 2016 to $18 billion from $17 billion in the prior quarter but decreased from $24 billion in the same quarter in 2015. As a percentage of total
middle market volume, new transactions increased in the fourth quarter to 54% versus 53% last quarter and versus 39% in the same period last in 2015.
Total new transactions for 2016 represented 51% of total middle market volume, versus 42% in 2015.

The pricing environment in our primary target market tightened in the fourth quarter as middle market loan yields were down to 6.4% from 6.7%
last quarter and down from 7.1% in the same quarter last year. Middle market loan yields continue to exhibit a premium versus large corporate loans.
Yields in the large corporate market were down to 4.9% in the fourth quarter from 5.2% last quarter and down from 5.8% in the same quarter last year.

Our direct lending platforms provide us with certain flexibility to allocate capital and redirect our origination focus to market segments with the
most favorable conditions in terms of demand and relative value. We believe that the yields on our new loan origination will continue to reflect a
combination of these broad market trends and shifts in the mix of loans we originate.

Conditions in our core funding markets continued to improve through the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year when broader
market uncertainty, soft CLO equity demand and regulatory constraints weighed on CLO pricing and volume. Conditions have improved in the fourth
quarter and we believe conditions will continue to improve throughout 2017 as industry-specific concerns and regulatory constraints are addressed and
investors continue to favor high-yielding, shorter duration floating rate bank loans and CLO bonds over fixed rate debt.

Total U.S. CLO issuance of $72 billion in 2016 represented a decrease relative to $99 billion last year, but throughout the year volume increased
in each successive quarter, with the fourth quarter totaling $26 billion, an increase versus $20 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015. Total U.S. CLO
issuance in 2014 and 2013 was approximately $124 billion and $81 billion, respectively. Along with the increasing momentum in CLO issuance, CLO
credit spreads tightened through the second half of 2016 and beginning of 2017, a trend we anticipate will continue through 2017 as market conditions
remain supportive for experienced managers such as NewStar to issue new CLOs. We also believe the availability and cost of warehouse financing
among banks remains

accommodative as an increasing number of banks are providing this type of financing and existing providers are expanding their lending activity. As a
result, we believe that the terms and conditions for financings available to established firms like NewStar will continue to be supportive.

Loan demand in the middle market is strongly influenced by the level of refinancing, acquisition activity and private investment, which is driven
largely by changes in the perceived risk environment, prevailing borrowing rates and private investment activity. These factors were generally favorable
as we originated $671 million of new loans at attractive yields in the fourth quarter and over $1.9 billion in the year. With attractive pricing, leverage
below the broader loan market, and equity contributions higher than the broader market, conditions in our primary target markets continue to remain
favorable. We anticipate that demand for loans and leases offered by the Company and conditions in our lending markets will remain supportive through
2017 and continue to provide opportunities for us to increase our origination volume.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014

NewStar’s basic and diluted earnings per share for 2016 was $0.61, on net income of $28.2 million compared to basic and diluted earnings per
share for 2015 of $0.37 and $0.35, respectively, on net income of $16.9 million, and basic and diluted earnings per share for 2014 of $0.22 and $0.21,
respectively, on net income of $10.6 million. Our managed portfolio was $6.7 billion at December 31, 2016 compared to $6.9 billion at December 31,
2015 and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2014.

Loan portfolio yield

Loan portfolio yield, which is interest income on our loans and leases divided by the average balances outstanding of our loans and leases, was
6.46% for 2016, 6.27% for 2015 and 6.09% for 2014. The increase in loan portfolio yield from 2015 to 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in our
average yield on interest earning assets from new loan and lease origination, re-pricings and increase in the LIBOR index subsequent to December 31,
2015. The increase in loan portfolio yield from 2014 to 2015 was primarily driven by an increase in our average yield on interest earning assets from
new loan and lease origination and re-pricings subsequent to December 31, 2014.

Net interest margin

Net interest margin, which is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets, was 2.19% for 2016, 2.39% for 2015 and 3.17% for
2014. The primary factors impacting net interest margin for 2016 were an increase in costs of borrowings, changes in the three-month LIBOR, and the
acceleration of amortization of $3.2 million of deferred financing fees related to the repayment of the financing arrangement with Macquarie Bank
Limited, two credit facilities due to the sale of Business Credit and the 2015-1 ABS due to the sale of the assets of Equipment Finance and the related
platform. The primary factors impacting net interest margin for 2015 were an increase in costs of borrowings, change in the three-month LIBOR, and
the acceleration of amortization of $3.5 million of deferred financing fees related to the repayment of our corporate credit facility with Fortress Credit
Corp. The primary factors impacting net interest margin for 2014 were the acceleration of amortization of $1.1 million of deferred financing fees related
to the Arlington Fund’s payoff of its credit facility with a portion of the proceeds from the Arlington Program’s term debt securitization, the
subordinated notes interest expense, the composition of interest earning assets, non-accrual loans, changes in three-month LIBOR, credit spreads and
cost of borrowings.

Efficiency ratio

Our efficiency ratio, which is total operating expenses divided by net interest income before provision for credit losses plus total non-interest
income, was 46.95% for 2016, 52.37% for 2015 and 50.32% for 2014. The decrease in our efficiency ratio for 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily
due to an increase in non-interest

income. During 2016, we sold Business Credit and the assets of Equipment Finance and the related platform, which resulted in a gain of $29.2 million
and asset management income increased $6.7 million from the previous year. This was offset by a $6.2 million decline in fee income. Our efficiency
ratio was further impacted by an increase in operating expenses of $15.5 million, comprised primarily of $7.7 million of severance related costs, and an
increase of strategic initiative costs of $6.3 million. The increase in our efficiency ratio for 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily due to increased
interest expense driven by an increase in our interest bearing liabilities, and the accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees totaling $3.5 million
related to the repayment of our corporate credit facility with Fortress Credit Corp.

Allowance for credit losses ratio

Allowance for credit losses ratio, which is allowance for credit losses divided by the amortized cost outstanding gross loans and leases excluding
loans held-for-sale, was 1.76% at December 31, 2016, 1.81% as of December 31, 2015 and 1.84% as of December 31, 2014. The decrease in the
allowance for credit losses ratio from 2015 to 2016 is primarily due to a decrease in the specific allowance as a result of an increase in charge-offs
primarily related to one credit that was restructured during the year and a slight decrease in the general allowance. The slight decrease in the general
provision is primarily related to the release of $1.3 million related to the sale of the equipment finance assets and a smaller amortized cost loan portfolio
that is subject to the allowance for loan and lease losses. This decrease was slightly offset by an increase related to ordinary course ratings migration
within the portfolio. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses ratio from 2014 to 2015 is primarily due to the increased mix of recently originated
loans as a percentage of the overall portfolio and a slight decrease in the general allowance, which was partially offset by the increase in general
provision primarily driven by an increase in outstanding loans and leases, and an increase in the specific allowance. During 2016, we recorded
$24.8 million of net specific provision for credit losses on impaired loans and had net charge offs totaling $33.0 million. During 2016, we recorded
$2.8 million of general provision for credit losses. At December 31, 2016, the specific allowance for credit losses was $19.8 million, and the general
allowance for credit losses was $31.6 million. At December 31, 2015, the specific allowance for credit losses was $26.8 million, and the general
allowance for credit losses was $31.9 million. We continually evaluate our allowance for credit losses methodology. If we determine that a change in our
allowance for credit losses methodology is advisable, as a result of the rapidly changing economic environment or otherwise, the revised allowance
methodology may result in higher or lower levels of allowance. Moreover, actual losses under our current or any revised methodology may differ
materially from our estimate.

Delinquent loan rate

Delinquent loan rate, which is total delinquent loans that are 60 days or more past due, divided by outstanding gross loans and leases, was 0.64%
as of December 31, 2016 as compared to 0.84% as of December 31, 2015. We had delinquent loans with an outstanding balance of $21.1 million and
$27.2 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect the delinquent loan rate to correlate to current economic conditions. During
times of economic expansion we expect the rate to decline, and during times of economic contraction, we expect the rate to increase.

Non-accrual loan rate

Non-accrual loan rate is defined as total balances outstanding of loans on non-accrual status divided by the total outstanding balance of our loans
and leases held for investment. Loans are put on non-accrual status if they are 90 days or more past due or if management believes it is probable that the
Company will be unable to collect contractual principal and interest in the normal course of business. The non-accrual loan rate was 2.99% as of
December 31, 2016 and 3.43% as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance of non-accrual loans
was $99.2 million and $111.3 million, respectively and total outstanding loans and leases held for investment held at amortized cost was $3.3 billion and
$3.2 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, these non-accrual loans had a carrying value before specific

reserves of $92.9 million and $104.7 million, respectively. We expect the non-accrual loan rate to correlate to economic conditions. During times of
economic expansion we expect the rate to decline, and during times of economic contraction, we expect the rate to increase, although actual results may
vary.

Non-performing asset rate

Non-performing asset rate is defined as the sum of total balances outstanding of loans on non-accrual status, other real estate owned and other
repossessed assets, divided by the sum of the total outstanding balance of our loans and leases held for investment and other real estate owned. The
non-performing asset rate was 3.45% as of December 31, 2016 and 3.44% as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the sum of the
aggregate outstanding balance of non-performing assets was $115.0 million and $111.5 million, respectively. We expect the non-performing asset rate to
correlate to economic conditions. During times of economic expansion we expect the rate to decline, and during times of economic contraction, we
expect the rate to increase, although actual results may vary.

Net charge off rate (end of period loans and leases)

Net charge off rate as a percentage of end of period loan and lease portfolio is defined as annualized charge-offs net of recoveries divided by the
total outstanding balance of our loans and leases held for investment. A charge-off occurs when management believes that all or part of the principal of a
particular loan is no longer recoverable and will not be repaid. Typically, a charge off occurs in a period after a loan has been identified as impaired and
a specific allowance has been established. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, the net charge off rate was 1.00%, 0.10% and 1.07% respectively. We expect the net
charge-off rate (end of period loans and leases) to correlate to economic conditions. During times of economic expansion we expect the rate to decline,
and during times of economic contraction, we expect the rate to increase, although actual results may vary.

Net charge off rate (average period loans and leases)

Net charge off rate as a percentage of average period loan and lease portfolio is defined as annualized charge-offs net of recoveries divided by the
average total outstanding balance of our loans and leases held for investment for the period. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, the net charge off rate was 0.88%,
0.11% and 1.10% respectively. We expect the net charge-off rate (average period loans and leases) to correlate to economic conditions. During times of
economic expansion we expect the rate to decline, and during times of economic contraction, we expect the rate to increase, although actual results may
vary.

Return on average assets

Return on average assets, which is net income divided by average total assets was 0.69% for 2016, 0.49% for 2015, and 0.42% for 2014.

Return on average equity

Return on average equity, which is net income divided by average equity, was 4.28% for 2016, 2.56% for 2015, and 1.72% for 2014.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015

Interest income. Interest income increased $48.9 million, to $250.7 million for 2016 from $201.8 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due
to an increase in the average balance of our interest earning assets to $4.1 billion from $3.4 billion and an increase in the yield on average interest
earning assets to 6.14% from 5.97% primarily due to an increase in contractual interest rates from new loan origination and re-pricing subsequent to
December 31, 2015. In addition, we had a nonperforming loan pay off at par on which we recognized $3.2 million of interest income in 2016.

Interest expense. Interest expense increased $40.3 million, to $161.3 million for 2016 from $121.0 million for 2015. The increase is primarily due
to an increase in leverage and higher costs of funds. During 2016, we

accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees totaling $3.2 million related to the repayment of the financing arrangement with Macquarie Bank
Limited, two credit facilities due to the sale of Business Credit and the 2015-1 ABS due to the sale of the assets of Equipment Finance and the related
platform. This compares to the accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees of $3.5 million related to the repayment of our corporate credit
facility with Fortress Credit Corp during 2015. The average balance of our interest bearing liabilities increased to $3.5 billion from $2.8 billion, and our
average cost of funds increased to 4.65% from 4.35%.

Net interest margin. Net interest margin decreased to 2.19% for 2016 from 2.39% for 2015. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due
to the shift in the mix of debt and the issuance of higher cost long-term debt during the first quarter of 2016. This was partially offset by the increase in
the average yield on interest earning assets noted above. The net interest spread, the difference between gross yield on our interest earning assets and the
total cost of our interest bearing liabilities, decreased to 1.49% from 1.62%.

The following table summarizes the yield and cost of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for 2016 and 2015:

Provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses increased to $27.5 million for 2016 from $18.4 million for 2015. The increase in the
provision was primarily due to an increase of $15.3 million of net specific provisions, partially off-set by a decrease of $6.2 million of general
provisions recorded during 2016 as compared to 2015. During 2016, we recorded net specific provisions for impaired loans of $24.8 million compared
to $9.5 million recorded during 2015. The increase in the net specific component of the provision for credit losses was primarily due to the deterioration
of five credits during the year. During 2016, we recorded general provisions of $2.7 million compared to general provisions of $8.9 million recorded
during 2015. The decrease in the general provision was primarily due to the release of $1.3 million of general provision due to the sale of Equipment
Finance assets as well as a smaller amortized loan portfolio balance that is subject to the allowance for loan and leases. Our general allowance for credit
losses covers probable losses in our amortized cost loan and lease portfolio with respect to loans and leases that are not impaired and for which no
specific impairment has been identified. A specific provision for credit losses is recorded with respect to loans for which it is probable that we will be
unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement for which there is impairment recognized. The
Company employs a variety of internally developed and third-party modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk, which are used in
developing an allowance for loan and lease losses on outstanding loans and leases held at amortized cost. The Company’s allowance framework
addresses economic conditions, capital market liquidity and industry circumstances from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective. The Company
considers and evaluates a number of factors, including but not limited to, changes in economic conditions, credit availability, industry, loss emergence
period, and multiple obligor concentrations in assessing both probabilities of default and loss severities as part of the general component of the
allowance for loan and lease losses.

On at least a quarterly basis, loans and leases are internally risk-rated based on individual credit criteria, including loan and lease type, loan and
lease structures (including balloon and bullet structures common in the Company’s loans), borrower industry, payment capacity, location and quality of
collateral if any. Borrowers provide the Company with financial information on either a monthly or quarterly basis. Ratings, corresponding

Table of Contents

assumed default rates and assumed loss severities are dynamically updated to reflect any changes in borrower condition or profile.

Prior to the sale of Business Credit, our asset based lending business, the Company utilized a proprietary model to risk rate the asset based loans
on a monthly basis. This model captured the impact of changes in industry and economic conditions as well as changes in the quality of the borrower’s
collateral and financial performance to assign a final risk rating. The Company also evaluated historical net loss trends by risk rating from a
comprehensive industry database covering more than twenty-five years of experience of the majority of the asset based lenders operating in the United
States. Based upon the monthly risk rating from the model, the reserve was adjusted to reflect the historical average for expected loss from the industry
database.

For Real Estate loans, the Company employs two mechanisms to capture the impact of industry and economic conditions. First, a loan’s risk
rating, and thereby its assumed default likelihood, can be adjusted to account for overall commercial real estate market conditions. Second, to the extent
that economic or industry trends adversely affect a substandard rated borrower’s loan-to-value ratio enough to impact its repayment ability, the
Company applies a stress multiplier to the loan’s probability of default. The multiplier is designed to account for default characteristics that are difficult
to quantify when market conditions cause commercial real estate prices to decline.

The Company periodically reviews its allowance for credit loss methodology to assess any necessary adjustments based upon changing economic
and capital market conditions. If the Company determines that changes in its allowance for credit losses methodology are advisable, as a result of
changes in the economic environment or otherwise, the revised allowance methodology may result in higher or lower levels of allowance. In 2015 the
Company enhanced its approach for determining the expected exposure at default to more precisely reflect loan and lease exposures at December 31,
2015. Actual losses under the Company’s current or any revised allowance methodology may differ materially from the Company’s estimate.

Additionally, when determining the amount of the general allowance, the Company supplements the base amount with an environmental reserve
amount which is governed by a score card system comprised of seven risk factors. In 2015, the scoring system of the environmental reserve risk factors
was recalibrated to align with the enhancement made to the approach for determining the exposure at default. The Company also performs a ratio
analysis of comparable money center banks, regional banks and finance companies. While the Company does not rely on this peer group comparison to
set the level of allowance for credit losses, it does assist management in identifying market trends and serves as an overall reasonableness check on the
allowance for credit losses computation.

A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the
loan agreement. Impairment of a loan is based upon (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate,
(ii) the loan’s observable market price, or (iii) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, depending on the circumstances and our
collection strategy. Impaired loans are identified based on the loan-by-loan risk rating process described above. Impaired loans include all non-accrual
loans, loans with partial charge-offs and loans which are troubled debt restructurings. It is the Company’s policy during the reporting period to record a
specific provision for credit losses to cover the identified impairment on a loan.

Impaired loans at December 31, 2016 were in Leveraged Finance over a range of industries impacted by the then current economic environment
including the following: Media and Communications, Healthcare, Energy, Industrial, Other Business Services, Consumer/Retail, and Building Materials.
For impaired Leveraged Finance and Equipment Finance loans (prior to the latter’s sale), the Company measured impairment based on expected cash
flows utilizing relevant information provided by the borrower and consideration of other market conditions or specific factors impacting recoverability.
Such amounts are discounted based on original loan or lease terms. For impaired Real Estate loans, the Company determined that the loans were
collateral dependent and measured

impairment based on the fair value of the related collateral utilizing recent appraisals from third-party appraisers, as well as internal estimates of market
value. As of December 31, 2016, we had impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $133.4 million. Impaired loans with an aggregate
outstanding balance of $114.8 million have been restructured and classified as troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2016, the Company had a
$19.8 million specific allowance for impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $73.5 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had one
restructured impaired loan that had an outstanding balance greater than $20.0 million. In this instance, we added to our position to maximize our
potential recovery of the outstanding principal. Impaired loans at December 31, 2015 were in Leveraged Finance, Equipment Finance and Real Estate
over a range of industries impacted by the then current economic environment including the following: Media and Communications, Industrial,
Commercial Real Estate, Other Business Services, Consumer/Retail, and Building Materials. As of December 31, 2015, we had impaired loans with an
aggregate outstanding balance of $193.2 million. Impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $183.6 million had been restructured and
classified as troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2015, the Company had a $26.8 million specific allowance for impaired loans with an
aggregate outstanding balance of $121.1 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had one restructured impaired loan that had an outstanding balance
greater than $20.0 million and two restructured impaired loans that had an outstanding balance greater than $30.0 million. In each of these cases, we
added to our position to maximize our potential recovery of the outstanding principal.

Non-interest income. Non-interest income increased $35.9 million to $54.3 million for 2016 from $18.4 million for 2015. For 2016, non-interest
income was primarily comprised of $29.2 million gain on sale of Business Credit and the assets of Equipment Finance and the related platform,
$13.4 million of asset management fees, $7.3 million of fee income, $2.4 million realized gain on loans held-for-sale and a $5.6 million positive
mark-to-market adjustment on the loans held at fair value, offset by a $6.1 million loss on the total return swap and a $2.1 million loss on loans sold. For
2015, non-interest income was primarily comprised of $13.5 million of fee income, $6.7 million of asset management fees, $2.6 million of unused fees
and a one-time $2.1 million gain on the sale of an equity interest in a restructured credit, offset by a $5.1 million unrealized loss on a total return swap,
and a $2.6 million unrealized loss on loans held for sale.

As a result of certain of our troubled debt restructurings, we have received equity interests in several of our impaired borrowers. The equity
interest in certain impaired borrowers is initially recorded at fair value when the debt is restructured and is subsequently analyzed at the end of each
quarter. In situations where we are deemed to be under the equity method of accounting, we record our ownership share of the borrowers’ results of
operations in non-interest income. Additionally, our corresponding share of our borrowers’ results of operations may directly impact the remaining net
book value of these respective loans. These equity interests may give rise to potential capital gains or losses, for tax purposes. This could impact future
period tax rates depending on our ability to recognize capital losses to the extent of any capital gains.

Operating expenses. Operating expenses increased $15.5 million, to $67.4 million for 2016 from $51.9 million for 2015. Employee compensation
and benefits increased $7.4 million primarily the result of severance costs associated with a reduction in staffing level to streamline operations. General
and administrative expenses increased $8.1 million primarily associated with an increase of strategic initiative costs of $6.3 million.

Income taxes. For 2016 and 2015, we provided for income taxes based on an effective tax rate of 42% and 41%, respectively. The effective tax
rates differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% due largely to state tax expense in both years.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had net deferred tax assets of $40.8 million and $33.1 million, respectively. In assessing if we will be able
to realize our deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. We considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016.
We considered carryback availability, the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income during the reversal periods, and
tax planning strategies in making this

assessment. We also considered our recent history of taxable income, trends in our earnings and tax rate, positive financial ratios, and the impact of the
downturn in the current economic environment (including the impact of credit on allowance and provision for loan losses; and the impact on funding
levels) on the Company. Based upon our assessment, we believe that a valuation allowance was not necessary as of December 31, 2016. As of
December 31, 2016, our deferred tax asset was primarily comprised of $23.4 million related to our allowance for credit losses and $9.4 million related to
equity compensation, accrued bonus and severance. The increase in our deferred tax asset was primarily the result of the sale of the assets of Equipment
Finance and the related platform, which had a deferred tax liability prior to the sale.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014

Interest income. Interest income increased $60.4 million, to $201.8 million for 2015 from $141.4 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due
to an increase in the average balance of our interest earning assets to $3.4 billion from $2.5 billion and an increase in the yield on average interest
earning assets to 5.97% from 5.64% primarily due to an increase in contractual interest rates from new loan origination and re-pricing subsequent to
December 31, 2014.

Interest expense. Interest expense increased $59.1 million, to $121.0 million for 2015 from $61.9 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due
to an increase in the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities to $2.8 billion from $2.0 billion, an increase in the average cost of funds to 4.35%
from 3.12%, and the accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees totaling $3.5 million related to the repayment of our corporate credit facility
with Fortress Credit Corp during 2015 compared to the accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees totaling $1.1 million related to the repayment
of Arlington Fund’s credit facility during 2014.

Net interest margin. Net interest margin decreased to 2.39% for 2015 from 3.17% for 2014. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due
to an increase in our average cost of interest bearing liabilities, an increase in average cost of funds, and the accelerated amortization of deferred
financing fees totaling $3.5 million related to the repayment of our corporate credit facility with Fortress Credit Corp. This was partially offset by an
increase in the average yield on interest earning assets from 5.64% to 5.97% in 2015. The net interest spread, the difference between gross yield on our
interest earning assets and the total cost of our interest bearing liabilities, decreased to 1.62% from 2.52%.

The following table summarizes the yield and cost of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for 2015 and 2014:

Provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses decreased to $18.4 million for 2015 from $27.1 million for 2014. The decrease in the
provision was primarily due to a decrease of $12.6 million of net specific provisions, partially off-set by an increase of $3.9 million of general
provisions recorded during 2015 as compared to 2014. During 2015, we recorded net specific provisions for impaired loans of $9.5 million compared to
$22.1 million recorded during 2014. The decrease in the net specific component of the provision for credit losses was primarily due to improvement in
credit performance related to two impaired loans offset by further negative credit migration related to previously identified impaired loans. Five loans
that had been previously

identified as impaired had been resolved during 2015 and two loans were identified as impaired during 2015. During 2015, we recorded general
provisions of $8.9 million compared to a general provisions of $5.0 million recorded during 2014.

Impaired loans at December 31, 2015 were in Leveraged Finance, Equipment Finance and Real Estate over a range of industries impacted by the
then current economic environment including the following: Media and Communications, Industrial, Commercial Real Estate, Other Business Services,
Consumer/Retail, and Building Materials. For impaired Leveraged Finance and Equipment Finance loans, the Company measured impairment based on
expected cash flows utilizing relevant information provided by the borrower and consideration of other market conditions or specific factors impacting
recoverability. Such amounts are discounted based on original loan or lease terms. For impaired Real Estate loans, the Company determined that the
loans were collateral dependent and measured impairment based on the fair value of the related collateral utilizing recent appraisals from third-party
appraisers, as well as internal estimates of market value. As of December 31, 2015, we had impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of
$193.2 million. Impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $183.6 million had been restructured and classified as troubled debt
restructurings. At December 31, 2015, the Company had a $26.8 million specific allowance for impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of
$121.1 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had one restructured impaired loan that had an outstanding balance greater than $20.0 million and two
restructured impaired loans that had an outstanding balance greater than $30.0 million. In each of these cases, we added to our position to maximize our
potential recovery of the outstanding principal. Impaired loans at December 31, 2014 were in Leveraged Finance, Equipment Finance and Real Estate
over a range of industries impacted by the then current economic environment including the following: Media and Communications, Industrial,
Commercial Real Estate, Other Business Services, Consumer/Retail, and Building Materials. As of December 31, 2014, we had impaired loans with an
aggregate outstanding balance of $217.2 million. Impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $175.6 million had been restructured and
classified as troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2014, the Company had a $20.7 million specific allowance for impaired loans with an
aggregate outstanding balance of $103.2 million. As of December 31, 2014, we had one restructured impaired loan that had an outstanding balance
greater than $20.0 million and one restructured impaired loan that had an outstanding balance greater than $30.0 million. In each of these cases, we
added to our position to maximize our potential recovery of the outstanding principal.

Non-interest income. Non-interest income increased $7.0 million to $18.4 million for 2015 from $11.4 million for 2014. For 2015, non-interest
income was primarily comprised of $13.5 million of fee income, $6.7 million of asset management fees, $2.6 million of unused fees and a one-time gain
$2.1 million gain on the sale of an equity interest in a restructured credit, offset by a $5.1 million unrealized loss on a total return swap, and a
$2.6 million unrealized loss on loans held for sale. For 2014, non-interest income was primarily comprised of $6.7 million of gains recognized from the
sale of equity interests in certain impaired borrowers, $2.5 million of fee income, $2.1 million of income from other real estate owned properties,
$1.8 million of unused fees, $1.1 million of asset management fees, $0.8 million of equity method of accounting losses, $0.6 million of net losses on the
value of equity interests in certain impaired borrowers, a $0.9 million unrealized loss on a total return swap, and a $0.8 million loss on the creation of a
new credit fund.

Operating expenses. Operating expenses increased $6.1 million, to $51.9 million for 2015 from $45.8 million for 2014. Employee compensation
and benefits increased $5.5 million primarily due to an increase in the number of employees as a result of the NewStar Capital acquisition. General and
administrative expenses increased $0.9 million.

Income taxes. For 2015 and 2014, we provided for income taxes based on an effective tax rate of 41%. The effective tax rates differed from the
federal statutory rate of 35% due largely to state tax expense in both years.

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had net deferred tax assets of $33.1 million and $28.1 million, respectively. In assessing if we will be able
to realize our deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is

more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We considered all available evidence, both positive and
negative, in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015. We considered carryback availability, the scheduled reversals of
deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income during the reversal periods, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. We also
considered our recent history of taxable income, trends in our earnings and tax rate, positive financial ratios, and the impact of the downturn in the
current economic environment (including the impact of credit on allowance and provision for loan losses; and the impact on funding levels) on the
Company. Based upon our assessment, we believe that a valuation allowance was not necessary as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, our
deferred tax asset was primarily comprised of $29.1 million related to our allowance for credit losses and $13.7 million related to equity compensation,
which was partially offset by deferred tax liabilities related the Equipment Finance portfolio.

Segment Reporting

NewStar manages its operations through two business segments, Commercial Lending and Asset Management.

Commercial Lending

The Commercial Lending segment represents our direct lending activities which are focused on providing a range of flexible senior secured debt
options to mid-sized companies with annual cash flow (EBITDA) typically between $15 million and $50 million owned by private equity investment
funds and managed by established professional alternative asset managers.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015

The Commercial Lending segment reported income before taxes of $36.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared
to $27.4 million for the same period in 2015. Net interest income increased $3.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to
the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the recognition of interest income on a nonperforming loan that was paid off at par,
as well as an increase in average interest earning assets due to originations subsequent to December 31, 2015. This was offset by an increase in average
interest bearing liabilities and an increase in costs of borrowings. The provision for loan loss amounted to $27.5 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2016 compared to $18.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Noninterest income derived from the Commercial
Lending segment totaled $34.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, up from $11.6 million from the twelve months ended
December 31, 2015. The increase in noninterest income was primarily the result of the sale of Business Credit and the assets of Equipment Finance and
the related platform. This was offset by a decrease of other lending fees of $6.4 million from the same period in 2015. Commercial Lending noninterest
expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 increased by $8.3 million from the same period in 2015, primarily related to strategic
initiative costs and severance related cost savings initiatives.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014

The Commercial Lending segment reported income before taxes of $27.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared
to $22.0 million for the same period in 2014. Net interest income decreased $2.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to
the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in our average cost of interest bearing liabilities and increase in average cost
of funds. This was offset by an increase in average balances of our interest earning assets and an increase in yield on average earning assets. The
provision for loan loss amounted to $18.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $27.1 million for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2014. Noninterest income derived from the Commercial Lending segment totaled $11.6 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2015, up from $10.9 million from the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase in noninterest income was primarily the
result of an increase of $11.0 million in fee income, which was offset by an increase in losses on the total return swap of $4.1 million and an increase in
losses on loans held-for-sale of $2.6 million. Commercial Lending noninterest expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 increased
by $1.5 million from the same period in 2015 primarily related to employee compensation.

Asset Management

The Asset Management segment includes credit funds managed by the Company and NewStar Capital. Credit funds managed by the Company
focus on middle market loans, liquid tradeable credit and liquid loan strategies. NewStar Capital manages assets across a series of CLOs that invest
primarily in broadly syndicated loans, as well as other sponsored funds and managed accounts that invest across various liquid, non-investment grade
asset classes, including broadly syndicated loans and bonds.

to $1.5 million for the same period in 2015. Net interest income increased $5.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the
twelve months ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the completion of the Arch Street CLO. Noninterest income derived from the Asset
Management segment was $19.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, up from $6.7 million, for the same period in 2015. This
increase is the result of our continued expansion of our asset management activities through new fund formation and the acquisition of NewStar Capital
during the fourth quarter of 2015. Noninterest expense increased by $7.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as the result of a full
year of compensation costs associated with NewStar Capital, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014

The Asset Management segment reported income before taxes of $1.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to a

2015 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the completion of the Clarendon Fund. Noninterest income
derived from the Asset Management segment was $6.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, up from $0.6 million in 2014. This
increase is the result of our continued expansion of our asset management activities through new fund formation and the acquisition of NewStar Capital
during the fourth quarter of 2015. Noninterest expense increased by $4.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 primarily as the result
of compensation and strategic costs associated with NewStar Capital.

Table of Contents

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash flow from operations, credit facilities, term debt securitizations and proceeds from equity and debt
offerings. We believe that these sources will be sufficient to fund our current operations, lending activities and other short-term liquidity needs. In
addition, we had $144.1 million in net loans held-for-sale on our balance sheet at December 31, 2016, which we have the ability to sell to generate
additional liquidity. In addition to opportunistic funding related to potential growth initiatives, our future liquidity needs will be determined primarily
based on prevailing market and economic conditions, the credit performance of our loan portfolio and loan origination volume. We may need to raise
additional capital in the future based on various factors including, but not limited to: faster than expected increases in the level of non-accrual loans;
lower than anticipated recoveries or cash flow from operations; and unexpected limitations on our ability to fund certain loans with credit facilities. We
may not be able to raise debt or equity capital on acceptable terms or at all. The incurrence of additional debt will increase our leverage and interest
expense, and the issuance of any equity or securities exercisable, convertible or exchangeable into Company common stock may be dilutive for existing
shareholders.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the U.S. economy continued to exhibit slow-to-moderate growth. Despite lingering uncertainty surrounding a
number of economic issues and a new administration, the fourth quarter saw largely positive results from leading economic indicators. Positive signals
were seen in consumer spending, consumer confidence, business equipment investment, housing, equities and manufacturing with stable signals shown
in labor and inflation. We expect stable trends and slow-to-moderate growth in the U.S. to continue and monetary policy to remain conducive to gradual
growth in the near term. We expect Treasury and investment grade bond rates to gradually increase, but remain relatively low in the near term, leading
investors to continue to focus on allocating capital to riskier, higher yielding, fixed and floating rate asset classes in order to generate additional yield
from their investments. In addition, we believe that the CLO market, which the Company partially relies upon for funding, will improve in 2017 and
remain supportive for experienced managers such as NewStar to issue CLOs. We believe the Company has substantially greater financial flexibility and
increased financing options due to our market experience and improvement in our financial performance.

We believe that our ability to access the capital markets, secure new credit facilities, and renew and/or amend our existing credit facilities
continues to demonstrate an overall improvement in the market conditions for funding and indicates progress in our ability to obtain financings on
improved terms in the future. Despite these signs of improving market conditions and relative stability in recent years, we cannot assure that these
conditions will continue, and it is possible that the financial markets could experience stress, volatility, and/or illiquidity. If they do, we could face
materially higher financing costs and reductions in leverage, which would affect our operating strategy and could materially and adversely affect our
financial condition.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $154.5 million and $35.9 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. We may invest a portion
of cash on hand in short-term liquid investments. From time to time, we may use a portion of our unrestricted cash to pay down our credit facilities
creating undrawn capacity which may be redrawn to meet liquidity needs in the future or to equity fund loans.

Restricted Cash

Separately, we had $262.6 million and $154.0 million of restricted cash as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The restricted cash
represents the balance of the principal and interest collections accounts and pre-funding amounts in our credit facilities, our term debt securitizations and
customer holdbacks and escrows. The use of the principal collection accounts’ cash is limited to funding the growth of our loans and portfolio within the
facilities or paying down related credit facilities or term debt securitizations. As of December 31, 2016, we could use $183.6 million of restricted cash to
fund new or existing loans. The interest collection

account cash is limited to the payment of interest, servicing fees and other expenses of our credit facilities and term debt securitizations and, if either a
ratings downgrade or failure to receive ratings confirmation occurs on the rated notes in a term debt securitization at the end of the funding period or if
coverage ratios are not met, paying down principal with respect thereto. Cash to fund the growth of our loan portfolio and to pay interest on our term
debt securitizations represented a large portion of our restricted cash balance at December 31, 2016.

Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

If a loan is 90 days or more past due, or if management believes it is probable we will be unable to collect contractual principal and interest in the
normal course of business, it is our policy to place the loan on non-accrual status. If a loan placed on non-accrual status is financed in a term debt
securitization which has an overcollateralization test and the overcollateralization test is out of compliance, then excess interest spread cash is diverted
and used to de-lever the securitization to bring the test back into compliance. If no overcollateralization test is present in the term debt securitization, the
loan may remain in the term debt securitization and excess interest spread cash distributions to us will cease until cash accumulated in the term debt
securitization equals the outstanding balance of the non-accrual loan. When a loan is on non-accrual status, accrued interest previously recognized as
interest income subsequent to the last cash receipt in the current year will be reversed, and the recognition of interest income on that loan will stop until
factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist and the loan has been brought current. We may make exceptions to this policy if the loan is well
secured and is in the process of collection. As of December 31, 2016 we had impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $133.4 million.
Impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $114.8 million have been restructured and classified as troubled debt restructurings. Impaired
loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $99.2 million were on non-accrual status. These non-accrual loans had a carrying value of $92.9 million
before specific reserves. During 2016, $33.0 million of impaired loans were charged-off. Impaired loans of $21.1 million were greater than 60 days past
due and classified as delinquent. During 2016, we recorded $24.8 million of net specific provisions for impaired loans. Included in our specific
allowance for impaired loans was $7.9 million related to delinquent loans. During 2016, we recorded $2.7 million of general provision which reflected
the release of $1.3 million of general provisions due to the sale of Equipment Finance assets. We closely monitor the credit quality of our loans and
leases which are partly reflected in our credit metrics such as loan delinquencies, non-accruals, and charge-offs. Changes to these credit metrics are
largely due to changes in economic conditions and seasoning of the loan and lease portfolio.

We have provided an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan and lease amortized cost portfolio.
Our allowance for loan and lease losses as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $50.9 million and $58.3 million, respectively, or 1.75% and 1.80% of
loans and leases, gross, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we also had a $0.5 million allowance for unfunded commitments, resulting in an
allowance for credit losses of 1.76%.

The allowance for credit losses is based on a review of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses and its two components on a
quarterly basis. The estimate of each component is based on observable information and on market and third-party data believed to be reflective of the
underlying credit losses being estimated.

It is the Company’s policy to record a specific provision for credit losses for all loans which we have identified impairments during the reporting
period. Subsequently, we may charge-off the portion of the loan for which a specific provision was recorded. All of these loans are classified as impaired
(if they have not been so classified already as a result of a troubled debt restructuring) and are disclosed in the Allowance for Credit Losses footnote to
the financial statements.

(1) Maturities for term debt are based on contractual maturity dates. Actual maturities may occur earlier.

We must comply with various covenants. The breach of certain of these covenants could result in a termination event and the exercise of remedies
if not cured. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants. These covenants are customary and vary depending on the type of
facility. These covenants include, but are not limited to, failure to service debt obligations, failure to meet liquidity covenants, key person events and
tangible net worth covenants, and failure to remain within prescribed facility portfolio delinquency, charge-off levels, and overcollateralization tests.

Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2016 we had two credit facilities through certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) a $615.0 million credit facility with
syndicated lenders agented by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association

(“Wells Fargo”) to fund leveraged finance loans and (ii) a $250.0 million credit facility with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) to fund leveraged finance
loans.

We have a $615.0 million credit facility with Wells Fargo to fund leveraged finance loans. The credit facility had an outstanding balance of
$401.1 million and unamortized deferred financing fees of $6.4 million as of December 31, 2016. In February 2016 and June 2016, the Company
upsized this facility, which increased the commitment amount from $475.0 million to $615.0 million. Interest on this facility accrues at a variable rate
per annum. The facility matures on August 10, 2020. The facility provides for a revolving reinvestment period which ends on August 10, 2018, with a
two-year amortization period.

The Company has a $250.0 million credit facility with Citibank to fund leveraged finance loans. The credit facility had an outstanding balance of
$53.2 million and unamortized deferred financing fees of $2.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Interest on this facility accrues at a variable rate per
annum. The facility provides for a revolving reinvestment period that ends on May 5, 2018, with a two-year amortization period.

On December 1, 2016, the Company sold the assets of NewStar Equipment Finance (“Equipment Finance”) and the related platform. In
connection with the sale, the Company repaid all outstanding indebtedness of Equipment Finance, including amounts outstanding under the
$75.0 million note purchase agreement with Wells Fargo, with an outstanding balance of $16.9 million.

On September 15, 2016, the Company repaid the $350.0 million note purchase agreement with Credit Suisse that provided the financing to fund
the purchase of broadly syndicated bank loans during the warehouse phase of the Arch Street CLO. The supplemental junior note commitment by
NewStar Capital was also repaid in full. The notes were repaid from proceeds of the Arch Street CLO bond issuance.

On March 31, 2016, the Company sold its membership interest in NewStar Business Credit LLC (“Business Credit”). In connection with the sale,
the Company repaid all outstanding indebtedness of Business Credit, including amounts outstanding under the $175.0 million credit facility with a
syndicate of lenders agented by DZ Bank AG Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftbank Frankfurt (“DZ Bank”) with an outstanding balance of
$102.0 million and the $165.0 million credit facility with a syndicate of lenders agented by Wells Fargo with an outstanding balance of $135.4 million,
each of which was terminated. The Company accelerated and recognized deferred financing fees of $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, related
to the warehouse facilities during the first quarter of 2016.

Senior notes

On April 22, 2015, the Company issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). On
November 9, 2015, the Company issued an additional $80.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes. The 2020 Notes were issued on
November 9, 2015, were issued at a debt discount of $0.8 million which will amortize over the life of the 2020 Notes. The Company used a portion of
the net proceeds from the April notes offering to repay in full its corporate credit facility with Fortress Credit Corp. The 2020 Notes mature on May 1,
2020, and bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per annum, which is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. At any time prior to
May 1, 2017, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain public
equity offerings at a price equal to 107.25% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon provided that
immediately following the redemption, at least 65% of the 2020 Notes that were originally issued remain outstanding. Additionally, at any time prior to
May 1, 2017, the Company may redeem some or all of the 2020 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and a make-whole premium. On or after May 1, 2017, the Company may redeem the 2020 Notes, in whole or in part, at
redemption prices specified in the 2020 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In addition, if the Company undergoes a change of control, the
Company will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 2020 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes,
plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2016 unamortized deferred financing fees were $5.5 million.

Table of Contents

We must comply with certain covenants and restrictions related to the 2020 Notes. Subject to certain exceptions as detailed therein, the indenture
relating to the 2020 Notes restricts our ability to incur additional Non-Funding Indebtedness (as defined in the indenture) but permits the incurrence of
indebtedness if on the date of such incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), our
Consolidated Non-Funding Debt to Equity Ratio (together with our Restricted Subsidiaries) is not greater than 1.75 to 1.00. Consolidated Non-Funding
Debt to Equity Ratio is defined, with respect to any person on any determination date, as the ratio of Consolidated Non-Funding Debt (as defined in the
indenture) of such person as of such determination date to the Consolidated Stockholders Equity (as defined in the indenture) of such person as of such
determination date. If we fail to comply with this and certain other covenants included in the senior notes indenture, it could constitute an event of
default that could result in the acceleration of the payment of the aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes then outstanding and accrued interest. At
December 31, 2016 and currently, we were in compliance with all such covenants under the 2020 Notes indenture.

As market conditions warrant and subject to our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, we may from time to time seek
to retire or repurchase our outstanding senior notes through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market
transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or
incurring new debt. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material to us. Furthermore, any such
repurchases or exchanges may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may impact the trading liquidity of such
indebtedness.

Subordinated notes

On December 4, 2014, the Company completed the initial closing of an investment of long-term capital from funds sponsored by Franklin Square
Capital Partners (“Franklin Square”) and sub-advised by GSO Capital Partners at which the Franklin Square funds purchased $200.0 million of 10-year
subordinated notes (the “Subordinated Notes”), which rank junior to the Company’s existing and future senior debt. During 2015, the Company drew an
additional $75 million of these Subordinated Notes. The Company drew the remaining $25 million in January 2016. The Subordinated Notes were
recorded at par less the initial relative fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the investment on December 4, 2014 and January 23, 2015
which was $53.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and $60.0 million as of December 31, 2015. The debt discount will amortize over the life of the notes
and will be recorded as non-cash interest expense as the Subordinated Notes accrete to par value. As of December 31, 2016, unamortized deferred
financing fees were $4.9 million. The Subordinated Notes bear interest at 8.25% and include a Payment-in-Kind (“PIK Toggle”) feature that allows the
Company, at its option, to elect to have interest accrued at a rate of 8.75% added to the principal of the Subordinated Notes instead of paying it in cash.
The Subordinated Notes have a ten year term and mature on December 4, 2024. They are callable during the first three years with payment of a make-
whole premium. The prepayment premium decreases to 103% and 101% after the third and fourth anniversaries of the closing, respectively. They are
callable at par after December 4, 2019. The Subordinated Notes require a mandatory payment at the end of each accrual period, beginning on
December 5, 2019. The Company is required to make a cash payment of principal plus accrued interest in an amount required to prevent the
Subordinated Notes from being treated as an “Applicable High Yield Discount Obligation” within the meaning of Section 163(i)(1) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Events of default under the Subordinated Notes include failure to pay interest or principal when due subject to
applicable grace periods, material uncured breaches of the terms of the Subordinated Notes, and bankruptcy/insolvency events.

Term Debt Securitizations

2012-2 CLO. On December 18, 2012, we completed a term debt securitization transaction. In conjunction with this transaction we established a
separate single-purpose bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, NewStar Commercial Loan Funding 2012-2 LLC (the “2012-2 CLO”) and sold and contributed
$325.9 million in loans

and investments (including unfunded commitments), or portions thereof, to the 2012-2 CLO. We remain the servicer of the loans. Simultaneously with
the initial sale and contribution, the 2012-2 CLO issued $263.3 million of notes to institutional investors. We retained $62.6 million, comprising 100%
of the 2012-2 CLO’s membership interests, Class E notes, Class F notes, and subordinated notes. On June 12, 2015, we sold 100% of the 2012-2 CLO’s
Class E Notes totaling $16.3 million to institutional investors. At December 31, 2016, the $233.0 million of outstanding drawn notes were collateralized
by the specific loans and investments, principal collection account cash and principal payment receivables totaling $279.2 million. At December 31,
2016, deferred financing fees were $0.7 million. The 2012-2 CLO permitted reinvestment of collateral principal repayments for a three-year period
which ended in January 2016.

We receive a loan collateral management fee and excess interest spread. We also receive payments with respect to the classes of notes we own in
accordance with the transaction documents. We expect to receive a principal distribution as owner of the membership interests when the term debt is
retired. If loan collateral in the 2012-2 CLO is in default under the terms of the indenture, the excess interest spread from the 2012-2 CLO may not be
distributed if the overcollateralization ratio, or other collateral quality tests, is not satisfied.

(including unfunded commitments), or portions thereof, to the 2014-1 CLO. We remain the servicer of the loans. Simultaneously with the initial sale and

$348.4 million. At December 31, 2016, deferred financing fees were $2.0 million. The 2014-1 CLO permits reinvestment of collateral principal
repayments for a four-year period ending in April 2018. Should we determine that reinvestment of collateral principal repayments are impractical in
light of market conditions or if collateral principal repayments are not reinvested within a prescribed timeframe, such funds may be used to repay the
outstanding notes.

2015-2 CLO. On September 15, 2015, we completed a term debt securitization transaction through our separate single-purpose bankruptcy-remote
subsidiary, NewStar Commercial Loan Funding 2015-2 LLC (the “2015-2 CLO”) and sold and contributed $298.4 million in loans and investments
(including unfunded commitments), or portions thereof, to the 2015-2 CLO. We remain the servicer of the loans. Simultaneously with the initial sale and
contribution, the 2015-2 CLO issued $327.8 million of notes to institutional investors. We retained $70.1 million, comprising 100% of the 2015-2
CLO’s membership interests and a portion of the Class E notes. At December 31, 2016, the $327.8 million of outstanding drawn notes were
collateralized by the specific loans and investments, principal collection account cash and principal payment receivables totaling $397.8 million. At
December 31, 2016, deferred financing fees were $2.9 million. The 2015-2 CLO permits reinvestment of collateral principal repayments for a four-year
period ending in August 2019. Should we determine that reinvestment of collateral principal repayments are impractical in light of market conditions or
if collateral principal repayments are not reinvested within a prescribed timeframe, such funds may be used to repay the outstanding notes.

We receive a loan collateral management fee and excess interest spread. We also receive payments with respect to the classes of notes we own in
accordance with the transaction documents. We expect to receive a principal distribution as owner of the membership interests when the term debt is
retired. If loan collateral in the 2015-2 CLO is in default under the terms of the indenture, the excess interest spread from the 2015-2 CLO may not be
distributed if the overcollateralization ratio, or other collateral quality tests, are not satisfied.

offered in the collateralized loan obligation (“Arch Street CLO”) were issued by Arch Street CLO, Ltd., an exempted company incorporated
under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and (with the exception of the Class E and F notes) by Arch Street CLO, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (each a subsidiary of NewStar Capital and collectively, “Arch Street”). The Arch Street CLO notes are backed by a diversified portfolio of
broadly syndicated loans purchased and serviced by the Company. Investors purchased approximately $370.3 million of the Arch Street CLO notes,
representing approximately 90.4% of the total capitalization of Arch Street. The Company retained all of the Class F notes and subordinated notes which
together totaled approximately $39.5 million, representing approximately 9.6% of the total capitalization of Arch Street. At December 31, 2016, the
outstanding note balance was $370.3 million and unamortized deferred financing fees were $4.2 million. The reinvestment period is expected to end in
October 2020 and scheduled to mature in October 2028.

The Company receives a loan collateral management fee and excess interest spread. The Company also receives payments with respect to the
classes of notes it owns in accordance with the transaction documents. The Company expects to receive a principal distribution as owner of the
membership interests when the term debt is retired. If loan collateral in the Arch Street CLO is in default under the terms of the indenture, the excess
interest spread from the Arch Street CLO may not be distributed if the overcollateralization ratio, or other collateral quality tests, are not satisfied.

interest amounts owed. The actual timing of payments will ultimately vary from the above data due to future fundings and repayments we expect
to occur.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

We maintain an overall risk management strategy that may incorporate the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned
fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. Our operations are subject to risks resulting from interest rate fluctuations on our interest-
earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities. We seek to provide maximum levels of net interest income, while maintaining acceptable levels of
interest rate and liquidity risk. As such, we may enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure to interest
rate fluctuations. Under the interest rate swap contracts, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest
amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. We record the exchanged amount in net interest income in our statements of
operations. Under the interest rate cap contracts, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between a specified fixed interest (the cap)
and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount, but only if the floating interest rate exceeds the cap rate. The
interest rate caps may not be matched to specific assets or liabilities and would not qualify for hedge accounting.

Interest rate risk mitigation products are offered to enable customers to meet their financing and risk management objectives. Derivative financial
instruments consist predominantly of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors. The interest rate risks to the Company of these customer
derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with other counterparties consisting primarily of large financial
institutions. The interest rate mitigation products do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

Gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges, including any cash payments made or received, are reported as gain or (loss) on
derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our borrowers.
These financial instruments include unfunded commitments, standby letters of credit and interest rate mitigation products. The instruments involve, to
varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The contract or notional
amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.

Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for standby letters of credit is represented
by the contractual amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for
on-balance sheet instruments.

Unused lines of credit are commitments to lend to a borrower if certain conditions have been met. These commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. We evaluate each borrower’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
The amount of collateral required is based on factors that include management’s credit evaluation of the borrower and the borrower’s compliance with
financial covenants. Due to their nature, we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts that will be required to fund our unfunded commitments.
The aggregate amount of these unfunded commitments may exceed our available funds. At December 31, 2016, we had $326.1 million of unused lines
of credit. Of these unused lines of credit, unfunded commitments related to revolving credit facilities were $257.5 million and unfunded commitments
related to delayed draw term loans were $68.6 million. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon, and as such the total commitment
does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance by a borrower to a third party. The credit risk
involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending credit to our borrowers. At December 31, 2016 we had
$8.2 million of standby letters of credit.

On December 4, 2014, we entered into a total return swap (“TRS”) for senior floating rate loans with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”). The TRS with
Citibank enabled us, through a wholly owned financing subsidiary, to obtain the economic benefits of the loans subject to the TRS, despite the fact that
such loans would not be directly owned by us, in return for an interest payment to Citibank. The underlying loan portfolio of the TRS was typically
large, liquid broadly syndicated loans. We acted as the manager of the TRS and selected the specific loans to be subject to the TRS. The TRS did not
qualify for hedge accounting treatment as it did not offset the risks of another investment position. The initial maximum market value (determined at the
time such loans became subject to the TRS) of the portfolio of loans subject to the TRS was $75.0 million. On each of December 15, 2014, March 2,
2015 and July 14, 2015, we entered into amendments to increase the maximum value of the TRS to $125.0 million, $150.0 million and $175.0 million,
respectively. Interest accrued at one-month LIBOR+1.60% per annum. We were required to cash collateralize a specified percentage of each loan
included under the TRS in accordance with margin requirements. On March 31, 2016, the TRS matured. At maturity we purchased approximately
$138.9 million of the loans that were referenced by the TRS. The majority of these loans were purchased to fund future CLOs.

Critical Accounting Policies

Accounting policies involving significant estimates and assumptions by management, which have, or could have, a material impact on our
financial statements, are considered critical accounting policies. The following are our critical accounting policies:

Allowance for credit losses

A general allowance is provided for loans and leases held at amortized cost that are not impaired. The Company employs a variety of internally
developed and third-party modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk, which are used in developing an allowance for loan and lease losses
on outstanding loans and leases within our amortized cost portfolio. The Company’s allowance framework addresses economic conditions, capital
market liquidity and industry circumstances from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective. The Company considers and evaluates a number of
factors, including but not limited to, changes in economic conditions, credit availability, industry, loss emergence period, and multiple obligor
concentrations in assessing both probabilities of default and loss severities as part of the general component of the allowance for loan and lease losses.

On at least a quarterly basis, loans and leases are internally risk-rated based on individual credit criteria, including loan and lease type, loan and
lease structures (including balloon and bullet structures common in the Company’s Leveraged Finance and Real Estate cash flow loans), borrower
industry, payment capacity, location and quality of collateral if any (including the Company’s Real Estate loans). Borrowers provide the Company with
financial information on either a monthly or quarterly basis. Ratings, corresponding assumed default rates and assumed loss severities are dynamically
updated to reflect any changes in borrower condition and/or profile.

For Leveraged Finance loans and Equipment Finance (prior to the latter’s sale) loans and leases, the data set used to construct probabilities of
default in its allowance for loan losses model, Moody’s CRD Private Firm Database, primarily contains middle market loans that share attributes similar
to the Company’s loans. The Company also considers the quality of the loan or lease terms and lender protections in determining a loan loss in the event
of default.

Prior to the sale of Business Credit, the Company utilized a proprietary model to risk rate the asset based loans on a monthly basis. This model
captured the impact of changes in industry and economic conditions as well as changes in the quality of the borrower’s collateral and financial
performance to assign a final risk rating. The Company also evaluated historical net loss trends by risk rating from a comprehensive industry database
covering more than twenty-five years of experience of the majority of the asset based lenders operating in the United States. Based upon the monthly
risk rating from the model, the reserve was adjusted to reflect the historical average for expected loss from the industry database. For Real Estate loans,
the Company employs two mechanisms to capture the impact of industry and economic conditions. First, a loan’s risk rating, and thereby its assumed
default likelihood, can be adjusted to account for overall commercial real estate market conditions. Second, to the extent that economic or industry
trends adversely affect a substandard rated borrower’s loan-to-value ratio enough to impact its repayment ability, the Company applies a stress multiplier
to the loan’s probability of default. The multiplier is designed to account for default characteristics that are difficult to quantify when market conditions
cause commercial real estate prices to decline.

The Company periodically reviews its allowance for credit loss methodology to assess any necessary adjustments based upon changing economic
and capital market conditions. If the Company determines that changes in its allowance for credit losses methodology are advisable, as a result of
changes in the economic environment or otherwise, the revised allowance methodology may result in higher or lower levels of allowance. In the fourth
quarter of 2015, the Company enhanced its approach for determining the expected exposure at default to more precisely reflect loan and lease exposures
at December 31, 2015. Given uncertain market conditions, actual losses under the Company’s current or any revised allowance methodology may differ
materially from the Company’s estimate.

Additionally, when determining the amount of the general allowance, the Company supplements the base amount with an environmental reserve
amount which is governed by a score card system comprised of seven risk factors. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the scoring system of the environmental
reserve risk factors was recalibrated to align with the enhancement made to the approach for determining the exposure at default. The Company also
performs a ratio analysis of comparable money center banks, regional banks and finance companies. While the Company does not rely on this peer
group comparison to set the level of allowance for credit losses, it does assist management in identifying market trends and serves as an overall
reasonableness check on the allowance for credit losses computation.

A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the
loan agreement. Impairment of a loan is based upon (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate,
(ii) the loan’s observable market price, or (iii) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, depending on the circumstances and our
collection strategy. Impaired loans are identified based on the loan-by-loan risk rating process described above. Impaired loans include all non-accrual
loans, loans with partial charge-offs and loans which are Troubled Debt Restructurings. It is the Company’s policy during the reporting period to record
a specific provision for credit losses to cover the identified impairment on a loan.

Impaired loans at December 31, 2016 were in Leveraged Finance over a range of industries impacted by the then current economic environment
including the following: Media and Communications, Healthcare, Energy, Industrial, Other Business Services, Consumer/Retail, and Building Materials.
For impaired Leveraged Finance and Equipment Finance loans (prior to the latter’s sale), the Company measured impairment based on expected cash
flows utilizing relevant information provided by the borrower and consideration of other market conditions or specific factors impacting recoverability.
Such amounts are discounted based on original loan terms. For impaired Real Estate loans, the Company determined that the loans were collateral
dependent and measured impairment based on the fair value of the related collateral utilizing recent appraisals from third-party appraisers, as well as
internal estimates of market value.

Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and the allowance is reduced by the charged off balance of the loan. The provision for credit
losses and recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance.

Valuation of deferred tax assets

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We regularly
review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary. In performing these reviews we
make estimates about future profits and tax planning strategies that would affect future taxable income and the realization of these deferred tax assets. A
change in these assumptions could result in a difference in valuation and impact our results of operations. Based upon our assessment, we believe that a
valuation allowance was not necessary as of December 31, 2016.

ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—An interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 provides that a company can only recognize
the tax position in the financial statements if the position is more likely than not to be upheld on audit, based only on the technical merits of the tax
position. If the recognition threshold is met, the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement.

Table of Contents

ASC 740 also addresses how interest and penalties should be accrued for uncertain tax positions, requiring that interest expense should be
recognized in the first period interest would be accrued under the tax law. The Company classifies all interest and penalties on recognized tax benefits as
a part of income tax expense.

The Company files U.S. federal and state income tax returns. As of December 31, 2016, the Company is subject to examination by the Internal
Revenue Service and most state tax authorities for tax years after December 31, 2012. A few states remain subject to examination for the year ended
December 31, 2011.

Revenue recognition

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the respective loan and debt product. The accrual of interest on
loans and other debt products is discontinued when principal or interest payments are past due by 90 days or more or when, in the opinion of
management, it is probable we will be unable to collect contractual principal and interest in the normal course of business. If loans are placed on
non-accrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income. Interest income on non-accrual
loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the principal balance is deemed collectible.

Nonrefundable fees and related direct costs associated with the origination or purchase of loans and other debt products are deferred and netted
against balances outstanding. The net deferred fees or costs are recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the loans
using a method which approximates the effective interest method. In connection with the prepayment of a loan or other debt product, a partial amount of
the remaining unamortized net deferred fees, costs, premiums or discounts are accelerated and recognized as interest income. The amortization of fees is
discontinued on non-accrual loans. Depending on the terms of a loan or other debt product, we may charge a prepayment fee and recognize it in the
period of the prepayment. We accrete any discount and amortize any premium from purchased debt products or acquired loans in a business combination
into interest income as a yield adjustment over the contractual life. Syndication, arrangement and structuring fees are recognized in the period the
service is completed as a component of non-interest income.

Valuation of investments in debt securities

We review the fair value of our other debt products quarterly. The fair value of our investments in debt securities, non-investment grade securities
and residual securities, are based on independent third-party quoted market prices, when available, at the reporting date for those or similar investments.
When no market is available, we estimate fair value using various valuation methodologies, including cash flow analysis and internally generated
financial models that incorporate significant assumptions and judgments, as well as qualitative factors.

Even if the general accuracy of our valuation models are validated, there are no assurances that our valuations are accurate because of the high
number of variables that affect cash flows associated with these complex cash flow structures, which differ on each securitization. Valuations are highly
dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the model. Because of the
inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily ascertainable market value, the fair value of investments may
differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for the investments, and the differences could be material. In
addition, if our estimates or assumptions with respect to these assets prove to be incorrect, we may be required to write down some or all of the value of
these assets.

A debt product is considered impaired when the fair value of the debt product declines below its amortized cost. The cost basis of the investment
is then written down to fair value. If management determines the impairment to be temporary, it is recorded in other comprehensive income, a
component of stockholders’ equity. If management determines the impairment to be other than temporary, it is recorded as an offset to other income

on our statements of operations. From time to time we may become aware of cash flow or credit issues with respect to our other debt products and these
other debt products are then monitored by management to determine if a write-down is appropriate.

Although we view write-downs of our other debt products as a normal and anticipated aspect of our business, material write-downs of the fair
value of our other debt products could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our allowance for credit losses does not cover
write-downs because we classify these assets as available-for-sale securities.

The description of certain instruments as “debt securities” is intended to describe the accounting treatment of those instruments and is not a
characterization of those instruments as securities for any other purpose.

Goodwill and Identified Intangible Assets

We record the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Our goodwill impairment assessment is performed
annually, or more frequently, should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying value. If we determine that the fair value
has declined below our related carrying value, an impairment is recognized to reduce the carrying value to its fair value.

Identified intangible assets are comprised of customer contracts and related customer relationships and are amortized over their estimated useful
lives. We monitor the useful lives of these assets and revise them, if necessary. We review historical and projected attrition rates and other events that
may influence our projections of the future economic benefit that we will derive from these relationships. Significant judgment is required to estimate
the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. We are currently amortizing our
identified intangible assets over an average useful life of approximately one year.

Loans Held-for-Sale

Loans classified as held-for-sale consist of loans originated by the Company, intended to be sold or syndicated to third parties (including credit
funds managed by the Company) or impaired loans for which a sale of the loan is expected as a result of a workout strategy. These loans are carried at
the lower of aggregate cost, net of any deferred origination costs or fees, or fair value.

Total Return Swap

We were party to a total return swap (“TRS”) through March 31, 2016. A TRS is a contract in which one party agrees to make periodic payments
to another party based on the change in the market value of the assets underlying the TRS, in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable
interest rate. The TRS effectively added leverage to our portfolio by providing investment exposure to underlying loans without owning or taking
physical custody, in return for an interest-type payment to Citi. The TRS was recorded at fair value as an asset or liability with changes in fair value
recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Realized gains or losses were recognized at the termination of the contract.

Valuation of debt and equity linked instruments

We account for the subordinated notes and associated warrants issued to Franklin Square as debt and equity-linked instruments. The warrants are
freestanding, indexed to the Company’s common stock and are classified as equity. They were initially recorded at relative fair value, with no
subsequent re-measurement. The allocation of the proceeds from the issuance of debt and warrants to Franklin Square was determined using the relative
fair value method. The allocation of proceeds to the warrants created a debt discount to the subordinated debt and will be amortized over the life of the
subordinated notes. The subordinated debt is presented net of the debt discount.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to changes in market values of our loans for which we elected to apply fair value option accounting, loans held-for-sale, which are
carried at lower of cost or market, and our investment in debt securities, available-for-sale and derivatives, which are carried at fair value. Fair value is
defined as the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and for all other investments and derivatives, fair value
is determined pursuant to a valuation policy and a consistent valuation process. Where a market quotation is not readily available, we estimate fair value
using various valuation methodologies, including cash flow analysis, as well as qualitative factors.

As of December 31, 2016, loans at fair value totaled $403.7 million. At December 31, 2016, we recorded a gain of $5.5 million related to the
change in fair value which was recorded in other miscellaneous income, net. We did not have any loans at fair value as of December 31, 2015.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, loans held-for-sale totaled $144.1 million and $478.8 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015,
we recorded a $2.4 million gain and a $2.6 million loss, respectively on loans held-for-sale.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, investments in debt securities available-for-sale totaled $119.3 million and $94.2 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a net unrealized loss of $6.4 million and $10.1 million, respectively on those debt securities. Any unrealized gain
or loss on these investments is included in Other Comprehensive Income in the equity section of the balance sheet, until realized.

Interest rate risk represents a market risk exposure to us. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility to our net interest income caused
by changes in market interest rates.

As of December 31, 2016, substantially all of the loans in our portfolio were at variable rates. For the loans at variable rates, approximately 91.8%
contain an interest rate floor, with an average floor of 1.02%. Our credit facilities and term debt securitizations all bear interest at variable rates without
interest rate floors. Our senior and subordinated notes are fixed rate.

The presence of interest rate floors in our loan agreements results in assets with hybrid fixed and floating rate loan characteristics. Provided that
the contractual interest rate remains at or below the interest rate floor, a performing loan will typically behave as a fixed rate instrument. If contractual
interest rates are in excess of the interest rate floor, a performing loan will typically behave as a floating rate instrument. In a low interest rate
environment, floors provide a benefit as we are able to earn additional income equal to the difference between the stated rate of the interest rate floor and
the corresponding contractual rate. If interest rates rise, the potential benefit provided by interest rate floors would decrease resulting in lower net
interest income. The cost of our variable rate debt would increase, while interest income from loans with interest rate floors would not change until
interest rates exceed the stated rate of the interest rate floors or upon the re-pricing or principal repayment of the loans.

Table of Contents

The following table shows the hypothetical estimated change in net interest income over a 12-month period based on a static, instantaneous
parallel shift in interest rates applied to our portfolio and cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016. Our modeling is based on contractual
terms and does not consider prepayment or changes in the composition of our portfolio or our current capital structure. It further generalizes that both
variable rate assets and liabilities are indexed to a flat 3 month LIBOR yield curve. Although we believe these measurements are representative of our
interest rate sensitivity, we can give no assurance that actual results would not differ materially from our modeled outcomes.
 

   
Rate Change
(Basis Points)   

Estimated Change
in Net Interest
Income Over

12 Months  
       ($ in thousands)  
Decrease of    100   $ 19,921 
Increase of    100    11,905 
Increase of    200    24,363 
Increase of    300    36,822 

The estimated changes in net interest income reflect the potential effect of interest rate floors on loans totaling approximately $3.2 billion. Due to
the presence of these interest rate floors, as interest rates begin to rise from current levels, the cost of our variable rate debt increases. The interest rate on
performing loans will remain fixed until the contractual rate exceeds the stated rate on the interest rate floors. Consequently, the result may be a negative
net interest income impact as interest rates initially increase until they reach an inflection point. Beyond this inflection point, which is typically close to
the portfolios weighted average stated floor rate, the benefit of rising rates begins to accrue to us as the interest rate on performing loans starts to adjust
upward.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
NewStar Financial, Inc.:

We have audited NewStar Financial Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). NewStar
Financial Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, NewStar Financial Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
balance sheets of NewStar Financial Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, and our report dated
March 2, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
NewStar Financial Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NewStar Financial Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NewStar
Financial Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 2, 2017 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

NEWSTAR FINANCIAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Organization

NewStar Financial, Inc. is an internally-managed, commercial finance company with $6.7 billion of assets managed across two complementary
business lines- middle market direct lending and asset management. The Company’s direct lending activities are focused on meeting the complex
financing needs of companies and private investors in the middle market through by offering a range of flexible debt financing options. Through its asset
management platforms, NewStar offers a range of investment products employing credit-oriented strategies focused on middle market loans and liquid,
tradeable credit. The Company manages approximately $1.3 billion of assets in a series of private credit funds that co-invest in middle market loans
originated through its established leveraged finance lending platform and its strategic relationship with GSO Capital, the credit division of The
Blackstone Group. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NewStar Capital, the Company also has more than $2 billion of assets managed across a series
of CLOs that invest primarily in broadly syndicated, non-investment grade loans, as well as other sponsored funds and managed accounts that invest
across various asset classes, including non-investment grade loans and bonds.

These lending activities require specialized skills and transaction experience, as well as a significant investment in personnel and operating
infrastructure. To meet these demands, our loans and leases are originated directly by teams of credit-trained bankers organized around key industry and
market segments. These teams are supported by centralized credit management and operating platforms. This structure enables us to leverage common
standards, systems, and industry and professional expertise across multiple businesses.

The Company targets its marketing and origination efforts at private equity firms, mid-sized companies, corporate executives, banks and a variety
of other referral sources and financial intermediaries to develop new customer relationships and source lending opportunities. The Company’s
origination network is national in scope and it targets companies with business operations across a broad range of industry sectors. The Company
employs highly experienced bankers and credit professionals to identify and structure new lending opportunities and manage customer relationships.
The Company believes that the quality of its professionals, the breadth of their relationships and referral networks, and their ability to develop creative
solutions for customers position it to be a valued partner and preferred lender for mid-sized companies and private equity funds with middle market
investment strategies.

The Company’s emphasis on direct origination is an important aspect of its marketing and credit strategy. The Company’s national network is
designed around specialized origination channels intended to generate a large set of potential lending opportunities. That allows the Company to be
highly selective in its credit process and to allocate capital to market segments that we believe represent the most attractive opportunities. The
Company’s direct origination network also generates proprietary lending opportunities with yield characteristics that we believe would not otherwise be
available through intermediaries. In addition, direct origination provides the Company with direct access to management teams and enhances its ability
to conduct detailed due diligence and credit analysis of prospective borrowers. It also allows the Company to negotiate transaction terms directly with
borrowers and, as a result, advise its customers on financial strategies and capital structures, which it believes benefits its credit performance.

The Company typically provides financing commitments to companies in amounts that range in size from $15 million to $50 million. The size of
financing commitments depends on various factors, including the type of loan, the credit characteristics of the borrower, the economic characteristics of
the loan, and the Company’s role in the transaction. The Company also selectively arranges larger transactions that it may retain on its balance sheet or
syndicate to other lenders, which may include funds that it manages for third party institutional investors. By syndicating loans to other lenders and the
Company’s managed funds, it is able to provide larger

financing commitments to its customers and generate fee income, while limiting our risk exposure to single borrowers. From time to time, however, the
Company’s balance sheet exposure to a single borrower exceeds $35 million.

Beginning in January 2016, the Company’s operations were divided into two reportable segments that represent its core businesses, Commercial
Lending and Asset Management.

The Commercial Lending segment represents our direct lending activities which are focused on providing a range of flexible senior secured debt
options to mid-sized companies with annual cash flow (EBITDA) typically between $15 million and $50 million owned by private equity investment
funds and managed by established professional alternative asset managers.

The Asset Management segment represents our investment advisory activities which are focused on providing opportunities for qualified investors
to invest in a range of credit funds managed by the Company. The Asset Management segment manages a series of private credit funds that co-invest in
middle market loans originated through its established direct lending platform. Additionally, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NewStar Capital, the
Company also manages assets across a series of CLOs that invest primarily in broadly syndicated loans, as well as other sponsored funds and managed
accounts that invest across various liquid, non-investment grade asset classes, including broadly syndicated loans and bonds.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, “NewStar”) have
been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). All material intercompany transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect certain reported amounts and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates most
susceptible to change in the near-term are the Company’s estimates of the allowance for credit losses, impairment of loans, recorded amounts of deferred
income taxes, contingent liability and impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.

Prior Period Reclassifications

Certain prior period disclosure amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all demand deposits held in banks and certain highly liquid instruments with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Investments in Debt Securities

Management determines the classification of securities at the time of purchase. If management has the intent and the Company has the ability at
the time of purchase to hold securities until maturity, they are classified as held-to-maturity. Investment securities held-to-maturity are stated at
amortized cost. Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time, but not necessarily to be held-to-maturity or on a long-term basis, are classified as
available-for-sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in other comprehensive

Table of Contents

income (loss), net of applicable income taxes. The fair value of debt securities are based on quoted market prices, when available, at the reporting date.
When no market is available, the Company estimates fair value using various valuation tools, including cash flow analyses that utilize financial
statements, business plans, as well as qualitative factors. The carrying values of all securities are adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts over the shorter of the period to call or maturity of the related security using a method that approximates the interest method. Realized gains or
losses on the sale of securities, if any, are determined using the amortized cost of the specific securities sold. Management evaluates securities for other-
than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on a periodic basis. Factors considered in determining whether an impairment is OTTI include: (1) the length of
time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, (2) projected future cash flows, (3) the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the issuers and (4) the intent and ability of the Company to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in fair
value which may be until maturity. The Company records an OTTI loss in an amount equal to the entire difference between the fair value and amortized
cost if (1) the Company intends to sell an impaired investment security, (2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the
investment security before its amortized costs are recovered or (3) for debt securities, the present value of expected future cash flows is not sufficient to
recover the entire amortized cost basis. If an investment security is determined to be OTTI but the Company does not intend to sell the investment
security, only the credit portion of the estimated loss is recognized in earnings, with the non-credit portion of the loss recognized in other comprehensive
income.

Loans Held-for-Sale

Loans classified as held-for-sale consist of loans originated by the Company, intended to be sold or syndicated to third parties (including credit
funds managed by the Company) or impaired loans for which a sale of the loan is expected as a result of a workout strategy. These loans are carried at
the lower of aggregate cost, net of any deferred origination costs or fees, or fair value.

Loans

Loans are stated at the principal amount outstanding or fair value when fair value option accounting has been elected. The Company has elected to
apply fair value option accounting to loans designated to the credit funds managed by NewStar Capital. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis
in accordance with the terms of the respective loan. Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans.
The accrual of interest on loans is typically discontinued when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or when, in the opinion of
management, it is probable it will be unable to collect contractual principal and interest in the normal course of business. When loans are placed on
nonaccrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income. Income on nonaccrual loans is
subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the loan’s principal balance is deemed collectible.

Nonrefundable loan fees and related direct costs associated with the origination of loans are deferred and included in loans, net in the consolidated
balance sheet. The net deferred fees or costs are recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the loans using a method
which approximates the interest method or taken into income when the related loans are paid off or sold. The Company accretes any discount from
purchased loans into loan fee income as a yield adjustment over the contractual life of the loan. The amortization of loan fees is discontinued on
non-accrual loans.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses

Our general allowance for credit losses covers probable losses incurred in our loan and lease amortized cost portfolio with respect to loans and
leases that are not impaired and for which no specific impairment has been identified. A specific provision for credit losses is recorded with respect to
loans for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The

Table of Contents

Company employs a variety of internally developed and third-party modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk, which are used in
developing an allowance for loan and lease losses on outstanding loans and leases within our amortized cost portfolio. The Company’s allowance
framework addresses economic conditions, capital market liquidity and industry circumstances from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective. The
Company considers and evaluates a number of factors, including but not limited to, changes in economic conditions, credit availability, industry, loss
emergence period, and multiple obligor concentrations in assessing both probabilities of default and loss severities as part of the general component of
the allowance for loan and lease losses.

The Company periodically reviews its allowance for credit loss methodology to assess any necessary adjustments based upon changing economic
and capital market conditions. If the Company determines that changes in its allowance for credit losses methodology are advisable, as a result of
changes in the economic environment or otherwise, the revised allowance methodology may result in higher or lower levels of allowance. In 2015, the
Company enhanced its approach for determining the expected exposure at default to more precisely reflect loan and lease exposures at December 31,
2015. Given uncertain market conditions, actual losses under the Company’s current or any revised allowance methodology may differ materially from
the Company’s estimate.

Additionally, when determining the amount of the general allowance, the Company supplements the base amount with an environmental reserve
amount which is governed by a score card system comprised of seven risk factors. In 2015, the scoring system of the environmental reserve risk factors
was recalibrated to align with the enhancement made to the approach for determining the exposure at default. The Company also performs a ratio
analysis of comparable money center banks, regional banks and finance companies. While the Company does not rely on this peer group comparison to
set the level of allowance for credit losses, it does assist management in identifying market trends and serves as an overall reasonableness check on the
allowance for credit losses computation.

A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the
loan agreement. Impairment of a loan is based upon (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate,
(ii) the loan’s observable market price, or (iii) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, depending on the circumstances and our
collection strategy. Impaired loans are identified based on the loan-by-loan risk rating process described above. Impaired loans include all non-accrual
loans, loans with partial charge-offs and loans which are Troubled Debt Restructurings (see Note 4). It is the Company’s policy during the reporting
period to record a specific provision for credit losses to cover the identified impairment on a loan.

Impaired loans at December 31, 2016 were in Leveraged Finance over a range of industries impacted by the current economic environment
including the following: Media and Communications, Healthcare, Energy, Industrial, Other Business Services, Consumer/Retail and Building Materials.
For impaired Leveraged Finance loans, the Company measured impairment based on expected cash flows utilizing relevant information provided by the
borrower and consideration of other market conditions or specific factors impacting recoverability. Such amounts are discounted based on original loan
terms.

Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and the allowance is reduced by the charged off balance of the loan. The provision for credit
losses and recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs represent fees and other direct incremental costs incurred in connection with borrowings and term debt securitizations.
These amounts are amortized using the straight-line method into earnings as interest expense ratably over the contractual term of the facility or the
estimated life of the term debt securitization.

Table of Contents

Debt and equity linked instruments

We account for the subordinated notes and associated warrants issued to Franklin Square as debt and equity-linked instruments. The warrants are
freestanding, indexed to the Company’s common stock and are classified as equity. They were initially recorded at relative fair value, with no
subsequent re-measurement. The allocation of the proceeds from the issuance of debt and warrants to Franklin Square was determined using the relative
fair value method. The allocation of proceeds to the warrants created a debt discount to the subordinated debt and will be amortized over the life of the
subordinated notes. The subordinated debt is presented net of the debt discount.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are carried at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over the following useful lives:
 
Leasehold improvements   Shorter of estimated life or remaining lease term
Furniture, fixtures and equipment   3-5 years

Goodwill and Identified Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to
amortization but tested for impairment at least annually utilizing a qualitative or quantitative approach or more frequently if events or circumstances
occur that indicate that impairment may have occurred. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to
historical or projected operating results, significant changes in the use of acquired assets or significant negative industry or economic trends.

The Company performs its assessment for impairment of goodwill annually. As part of this evaluation, the Company makes a qualitative
assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an acquired asset is greater than its carrying amount. If the Company qualitatively
concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an acquired asset is greater than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If,
however, the Company qualitatively concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an acquired asset is less than its carrying value, the
Company performs a two-step quantitative impairment test to determine whether the asset is impaired. If impairment is deemed to have occurred, then
an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

Identified intangible assets are assets resulting from acquisitions that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. The recoverability of
identified intangible assets is evaluated for impairment at least annually. If impairment is deemed to have occurred, then an impairment loss would be
recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value.

Earnings Per Share (“EPS”)

The Company utilizes the two-class method to calculate earnings per share, which requires that unvested share-based awards be treated as
participating securities in the computation of EPS. Under the two-class method, earnings are allocated to common shareholders and participating
securities based upon the proportion of each to the total weighted average shares available. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing
net earnings allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings reflect the potential
dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
issuance of common stock that then shared in our earnings.

Table of Contents

Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or
liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The price in the principal (or most
advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability is not adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction
that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for
transactions involving such assets and liabilities. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are independent, knowledgeable,
able to transact and willing to transact. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and provides disclosures
about fair value measurements. The required disclosures about fair value measurements have been included in Note 18.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases,
and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company classifies all interest and penalties on
recognized tax benefits as a part of income tax expense.

Fee Income Recognition

Origination fees and costs are deferred and amortized as yield adjustments over the contractual life of the loans and investments. In connection
with the prepayment of a loan or other debt product, any remaining unamortized net deferred fees for that loan are accelerated and, depending on the
terms of the loan, there may be an additional fee charged based upon the prepayment and recognized in the period of the prepayment. Syndication and
structuring fees are recognized in the period the service is completed and funds received as fee income.

Asset Management Income

NewStar Financial, Inc. earns asset management income for investment management services performed for managed credit funds that co-invest
in middle market loans originated through its established direct lending platform and managed assets across a series of CLOs that investment primarily
in broadly syndicated loans, as well as other sponsored funds and managed accounts. NewStar accrues this income when earned, on a monthly basis, and
classifies it as asset management income in the consolidated statements of operations.

Stock Based Compensation

The Company follows ASC 718, Share-Based Payment, which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values on the grant date.

For awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled after January 1, 2006, the Company estimates the fair value of stock-based awards using
the Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including expected term and expected price volatility. Changes
in these assumptions can materially affect the calculated fair value of stock-based compensation and the related expense to be recognized. Further,

Table of Contents

for awards that contain performance measures and conditions, the Company makes an assessment, based on management’s judgment, of the probability
of these conditions being satisfied, which affects the timing and the amount of expense to be recognized. If the Company’s judgment as to whether these
conditions are probable of occurrence are not appropriate, the financial statements could be materially affected.

Gain (loss) on sale of loans

All loans sold to date have been sold without recourse. When loans are sold, a gain or loss is recognized to the extent that the sales proceeds net of
deferred fees and costs exceed or are less than the carrying value of the loans. Gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method.

Equity and Cost Method Investments

The Company may acquire a portion of the equity in borrowers. In cases where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over
the borrower, it accounts for its equity interest under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company recognizes
its proportional share of the borrower’s GAAP net income in its results of operations. In cases where the equity of the underlying company has no value,
and the borrower incurs losses, the Company will apply its proportional share of the GAAP loss against the principal of the outstanding loan to the
borrower. In circumstances where we do not have substantial influence over the company, we account for the equity interest under the cost method of
accounting. The equity interest is recorded at its historical cost within other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. The Company evaluates its equity
and cost method investments for impairment by assessing whether the fair value of the equity interest has declined below its carrying value for a period
we consider other-than-temporary. If it determines that a decline in fair value below our carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is
recognized to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its fair value.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company accounts for derivatives and hedging activities on the consolidated balance sheet in either other assets or other liabilities at their
respective fair values.

On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as either (1) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the
variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge) or as (2) a derivative trading instrument. For
all hedging relationships the Company formally documents the hedging relationship and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the
hedge, the hedging instrument, the item, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk
will be assessed, and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges
to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and
on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged
items. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that is designated and qualifies as a cash-flow hedge are recorded in other
comprehensive income to the extent that the derivative is effective as a hedge, until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the
designated hedged item. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative instrument that qualifies as a cash-flow hedge is reported in
earnings.

The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in
the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument
because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur, or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no
longer appropriate. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued or was never applied, the Company continues to carry the derivative at its
fair value on the balance sheet and recognizes any

subsequent changes in its fair value in earnings. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not
occur by the date (or within the time period) originally specified or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the Company recognizes
immediately in earnings, gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on derivatives not designated as
hedges, including any cash payments made or received, are reported as gain (loss) on derivatives in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

Total Return Swap

The Company was party to a total return swap (“TRS”) through March 31, 2016. A TRS is a contract in which one party agrees to make periodic
payments to another party based on the change in the market value of the assets underlying the TRS, in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or
variable interest rate. The TRS effectively added leverage to our portfolio by providing investment exposure to underlying loans without owning or
taking physical custody, in return for an interest-type payment to Citi. The TRS was recorded at fair value as an asset or liability with changes in fair
value recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Realized gains or losses are recognized at the maturity of the contract.

Comprehensive Income (Loss), net of tax

The Company records the change in fair value of cash flow hedge derivatives and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities in
other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reclassified to net income as the gains and losses are
realized upon sale of the securities. Other than temporary impairment charges are reclassified to earnings at the time of the charge.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments in Business Combinations
(Topic 805). ASU 2015-16 eliminated the requirement to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur
in periods after a business combination is consummated. ASU 2015-16 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that period beginning
after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted ASU 2015-16 on January 1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 did not have a material impact on our
results from operations or financial position.

the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for the interim or annual period beginning after
December 15, 2015. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016 and applied the standard retrospectively. The balance sheet presented has

guidance about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to
provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim
periods thereafter. The Company adopted ASU 2014-15 on December 31, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 did not have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards not yet required to be adopted as of December 31, 2016

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize
the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most
existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect
transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective
Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, while earlier application is
permitted only for annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2016. In March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), that clarifies how to apply
revenue recognition guidance related to whether an entity is a principal or an agent. The update clarifies that an entity is a principal when it controls the
specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer, and is an agent when it does not control the specified good or service
before it is transferred to the customer. The effective date and transition of ASU 2016-08 is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU
2014-09. The Company has established a team which continues to evaluate and document the possible impacts of the standard, including potential
changes to the accounting for investment management services performed, and also considering any reporting, tax and operational implications. The
Company has not yet finalized a decision regarding a transition method and does not expect the

provisions of ASU 2014-09 to result in any material changes to the timing of when revenue is recognized. The Company will adopt this standard
effective January 1, 2018.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740). ASU 2015-17 eliminates the requirement to separate deferred
income tax liabilities into current and non-current classification in a classified balance sheet. It further requires that all deferred income taxes be
classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period
beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that
reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU 2015-17 may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company does not classify its
deferred income tax liabilities into current and non-current in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. As a result, there is no impact of the adoption of ASU
2015-17 to the Company.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities (Topic 825-10). ASU 2016-01 amends existing guidance related to the accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities. These
amendments, among other things, require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in
consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, require public business entities to use the
exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, require separate presentation of financial assets and
financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset and eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the
method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized
cost. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, with early
adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have on results from operations and
financial position.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 amends existing guidance related to the accounting for
leases. These amendments, among other things, require lessees to account for most leases on the balance sheet while recognizing expense on the income
statement in a manner similar to existing guidance. For lessors the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and
direct finance leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2018,
with early adoption permitted. ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method for all entities. The Company has performed a
preliminary analysis of ASU 2016-02. The Company typically categorizes its leases as either office space leases or as other leases. The adoption of ASU
2016-02 is expected to have an impact on the balance sheet of the Company, as both the value of the leased office space as well as the current value of
future lease liabilities will be recorded. The Company does not expect there to be a material impact to financial position for all other leases due to the
limited volume and size of transactions; however the evaluation has yet to be performed. The Company plans to adopt this standard effective January 1,
2019.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting (Topic 323). ASU 2016-07
eliminates the requirement for an investor to retroactively apply the equity method when its increase in ownership interest (or degree of influence) in an
investee triggers equity method accounting. ASU 2016-07 is effective for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-07 will have on results from operations
and financial position.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718). ASU 2016-09
simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and
statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of related amounts within the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is

effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on results from operations and financial position.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326). ASU 2016-13 sets forth a “current expected credit
loss” (CECL) model which requires the Company to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on
historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the
measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit exposures. ASU 2016-13
requires enhanced disclosures, including qualitative and quantitative requirements, to help understand significant estimates and judgments used in
estimating credit losses, as well as provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. ASU 2016-13 is effective for
annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted after annual and
interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 31, 2018. ASU 2016-13 mandates a modified retrospective transition method for
all entities. The Company is currently in the scoping and evaluating phase of the adoption of ASU 2016-13.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the classification of
certain cash receipts and cash payments for presentation in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods and interim periods
within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the
adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on results from operations or financial position.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810), Interest Held Through Related Parties That Are Under Common
Control. ASU 2016-17 changes the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by changing how a reporting entity that
is a single decision maker of a VIE treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting
entity. ASU 2016-17 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, with early
adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-17 on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. ASU 2016-18 requires that the
statement of cash flows include restricted cash in the beginning and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows and that the
statement of cash flows explain changes in restricted cash during the period. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that
reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. However, adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the
fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-18 to have an impact on its financial position or
result of operations and expects the impact to be disclosure only.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
ASU 2017-04 simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04 an
entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, and
should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value with the loss not exceeding
the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting
period beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2017-04 on
our consolidated financial statements.

Note 3. Acquisitions and Disposition Activities

Sale of NewStar Equipment Finance assets and related platform

On December 1, 2016, the Company sold the assets of NewStar Equipment Finance (“Equipment Finance”) and related platform to a third party
and exited the business. The sale of Equipment Finance assets was the result of the Company’s decision to exit businesses with economic models
increasingly challenged by competition from banks and other lenders with access to lower cost funding. The sale resulted in a gain of $6.7 million,
before transaction related costs of $4.3 million. The net gain is recorded in non-interest income on the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations. In connection with the sale of the assets of Equipment Finance, the Company established a contingent liability to cover any potential credit
indemnification costs resulting from actual credit losses incurred on the assets sold. As of December 31, 2016 a $1.4 million liability was recorded to
cover any potential credit losses. This liability reflects management’s best estimate of losses, taking into consideration the individual credit quality and
borrower activity since origination and the anticipated residual value of the assets sold. The initial indemnification is capped at $10.0 million of actual
credit losses and is reduced to $8.0 million at December 31, 2017, further reduced to $5.0 million at December 31, 2018, $3.0 million at December 31,
2019 and zero as of December 31, 2020.

Sale of NewStar Business Credit LLC

On March 31, 2016, the Company sold its asset based lending business, NewStar Business Credit LLC (“Business Credit”) to a third party. The
Company opted to sell Business Credit because it was faced with challenges from increasing competition with access to lower cost of funding. The sale
resulted in a gain of $22.5 million, before transaction related costs of $2.5 million. The net gain is recorded in non-interest income on the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations.

Acquisition

On October 7, 2015 (the “Acquisition Date”), the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Boston-based
Feingold O’Keeffe Capital, LLC (“FOC Partners”), a boutique credit manager. The Company operates FOC Partners as NewStar Capital, a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company. The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the Company’s existing asset management capabilities.

Total consideration paid in the FOC Partners acquisition consisted of $20.8 million in cash. The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the
acquisition were recorded by the company at their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. The excess of consideration paid over the fair value
of identifiable net assets was recorded as goodwill in the consolidated financial statements. As of the Acquisition Date, the Company recorded
$17.9 million of goodwill and $1.4 million of identified intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of FOC Partners.

These loans are carried at the lower of aggregate cost, net of any deferred origination costs or fees, or fair value.

At December 31, 2016, loans held-for-sale consisted of loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $146.0 million that were intended to be
sold to credit funds managed by the Company. The Company sold loans with an outstanding balance totaling $638.3 million for an aggregate loss of
$0.9 million to credit funds managed by the Company during 2016. The Company sold loans with an outstanding balance totaling $188.2 million for an
aggregate loss of $1.5 million to entities other than credit funds during 2016. The Company sold loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of
$105.3 million for a gain of $0.5 million to entities other than credit funds during 2015. The Company sold loans with an aggregate outstanding balance

The Company provides commercial loans and commercial real estate loans to customers throughout the United States. The Company’s borrowers
may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and, as a result, may have a lower capacity to make scheduled payments of interest or
principal on their borrowings during these periods. Adverse economic conditions also may decrease the estimated value of the collateral, particularly
real estate, securing some of the Company’s loans. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, certain events may occur, including, but not
limited to, adverse economic conditions and adverse events affecting specific clients, industries or markets, that could adversely affect the ability of
borrowers to make timely scheduled principal and interest payments on their loans.

The Company internally risk rates loans based on individual credit criteria on at least a quarterly basis. Borrowers provide the Company with
financial information on either a quarterly or monthly basis. Loan ratings as well as identification of impaired loans are dynamically updated to reflect
changes in borrower condition or profile. A loan is considered to be impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts
due to it according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans include all non-accrual loans, loans with partial charge-offs and loans
which are troubled debt restructurings (“TDR”).

The Company utilizes a number of analytical tools for the purpose of estimating probability of default and loss given default for its lending
groups. The quantitative models employed by the Company in its Leveraged Finance business utilize Moody’s KMV RiskCalc credit risk model in
combination with a proprietary qualitative model, which generates a rating that maps to a probability of default estimate. The Real Estate lending group
utilizes a proprietary model that has been developed to capture risk characteristics unique to the lending activities in that line of business. The model
produces an obligor risk rating which corresponds to a probability of default and also produces a loss given default. In each case, the probability of
default and the loss given default are used

to calculate an expected loss for those lending groups. Prior to the sale of the Equipment Finance assets, management used similar models for its
Equipment Finance portfolio as its Leveraged Finance group. Prior to the sale of Business Credit, management utilized a proprietary model that
produced a rating that corresponded to an expected loss, for the Business Credit portfolio.

Loans and leases which are rated at or below a specified threshold are typically classified as “Pass”, and loans and leases rated above that
threshold are typically classified as “Criticized”, a characterization that may apply to impaired loans, including TDR. As of December 31, 2016,
$118.7 million of the Company’s loans were classified as “Criticized”, all of which were impaired loans, and $3.2 billion were classified as “Pass”. As
of December 31, 2015, $152.1 million of the Company’s loans were classified as “Criticized”, including $143.6 million of the Company’s impaired
loans, and $3.1 billion were classified as “Pass”.

When the Company determines a loan is impaired, the Company will evaluate the loan individually and if necessary establish a specific
allowance. The loan will be analyzed and may be placed on non-accrual status. If the asset deteriorates further, the specific allowance may increase, and
ultimately may result in a loss and charge-off.

A TDR that performs in accordance with the terms of the restructuring may improve its risk profile over time. While the concessions in terms of
pricing or amortization may not have been reversed and further amended to “market” levels, the financial condition of the borrower may improve over
time to the point where the rating improves from the “Criticized” classification that was appropriate immediately prior to, or at, restructuring.

A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the
loan agreement. The measurement of impairment of a loan is based upon (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s
effective interest rate, (ii) the loan’s observable market price, or (iii) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, depending on the
circumstances and our collection strategy. Impaired loans are identified based on the loan-by-loan risk rating process described above. It is the
Company’s policy during the reporting period to record a specific provision for credit losses for all loans for which we have serious doubts as to the
ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms.

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $133.4 million. Impaired loans with an
aggregate outstanding balance of $114.8 million have been restructured and classified as TDR. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate carrying value
of equity investments in certain of the Company’s borrowers in connection with TDRs totaled $9.9 million. Impaired loans with an aggregate
outstanding balance of $99.2 million were also on non-accrual status. These non-accrual loans had a carrying value of $92.9 million before specific
reserves. For impaired loans on non-accrual status, the Company’s policy is to reverse the accrued interest previously recognized as interest income
subsequent to the last cash receipt in the current year. The recognition of interest income on the loan only resumes when factors indicating doubtful
collection no longer exist and the non-accrual loan has been brought current. During 2016, the Company charged off $25.7 million of outstanding
non-accrual loans. During 2016, the Company placed loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $27.1 million on non-accrual status and no loans
were returned to performing status. During 2016, the Company recorded $24.8 million of net specific provisions for impaired loans. At December 31,
2016, the Company had a $19.8 million specific allowance for impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $73.5 million. At December 31,
2016, additional funding commitments for impaired loans totaled $11.9 million. The Company’s obligation to fulfill the additional funding commitments
on impaired loans is generally contingent on the borrower’s compliance with the terms of the credit agreement and the borrowing base availability for
asset-based loans, or if the borrower is not in compliance additional funding commitments may be made at the Company’s discretion. As of
December 31, 2016, loans to two borrowers totaling approximately $21.1 million were on non-accrual status and were greater than 60 days past due and
classified as delinquent by the Company. Included in the $19.8 million specific allowance for impaired loans was $7.9 million related to delinquent
loans.

During 2016, the Company foreclosed on a held-for-sale impaired real estate loan. Simultaneous with the foreclosure, the Company sold a portion
of the property for $8.5 million and applied the proceeds to the principal loan balance. The remaining $15.8 million was transferred to Other Real Estate
Owned (“OREO”). During 2015, the Company sold one commercial real estate OREO property for $3.0 million resulting in a loss on sale of
$0.01 million. During 2014, the Company sold one commercial real estate OREO property for $9.5 million resulting in a gain on sale of $0.01 million.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $193.2 million. Impaired loans with an
aggregate outstanding balance of $183.6 million had been restructured and classified as TDR. As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate carrying value of
equity investments in certain of the Company’s borrowers in connection with TDRs totaled $11.4 million. Impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding
balance of $111.3 million were also on non-accrual status. These non-accrual loans had a carrying value of $104.7 million before specific reserves.
During 2015, the Company charged off $4.0 million of outstanding non-accrual loans. During 2015, the Company placed loans with an aggregate
outstanding balance of $38.2 million on non-accrual status and returned loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $0.9 million to performing
status. During 2015, the Company recorded $9.5 million of net specific provisions for impaired loans. At December 31, 2015, the Company had a
$26.8 million specific allowance for impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $121.1 million. At December 31, 2015, additional funding
commitments for impaired loans totaled $10.9 million. As of December 31, 2015, $18.6 million of loans on non-accrual status were greater than 60 days
past due and classified as delinquent by the Company. Included in the $26.8 million specific allowance for impaired loans was $2.8 million related to
delinquent loans.

During 2016, 2015 and 2014 the Company recorded net charge-offs of $33.0 million, $3.4 million and $25.3 million, respectively. During 2016,
2015 and 2014 the Company recorded recoveries of previously charged-off loans of $0.4 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

When a loan is determined to be uncollectible, the specific allowance is charged off, which reduces the gross investment in the loan. The
Company may record the initial specific allowance related to an impaired loan in the same period as it records a partial charge-off in certain
circumstances such as if the terms of a restructured loan are finalized during that period.

While charge-offs typically have no net impact on the carrying value of net loans and leases, charge-offs lower the level of the allowance for loan
and lease losses; and, as a result, reduce the percentage of allowance for loans and leases to total loans and leases, and the percentage of allowance for
loan and leases losses to non-performing loans.

Loans being restructured typically develop adverse performance trends as a result of internal or external factors, the result of which is an inability
to comply with the terms of the applicable credit agreement governing their obligations to the Company. In order to mitigate default risk and/or
liquidation, assuming that liquidation proceeds are not viewed as a more favorable outcome to the Company and other lenders, the Company will enter
into negotiations with the borrower and its shareholders on the terms of a restructuring. When restructuring a loan, the Company undertakes an extensive
diligence process which typically includes (i) construction of a financial model that runs through the tenor of the restructuring term, (ii) meetings with
management of the borrower, (iii) engagement of third party consultants and (iv) internal analysis. Once a restructuring proposal is developed, it is
subject to approval by both the Company’s Underwriting Committee and the Company’s Investment Committee. Loans will be removed from TDR
classification after a period of performance following the refinancing of outstanding obligations on terms which are determined to be “market” in all
material respects, or upon full payoff of the loan. The Company may modify loans that are not determined to be a TDR. Where a loan is modified or
restructured but loan terms are considered market and no concessions were given on the loan terms, including price, principal amortization or obligation,
or other restrictive covenants, a loan will not be classified as a TDR.

The Company has made the following types of concessions in the context of a TDR:

Group I:
 

 •  extension of principal repayment term
 

 •  principal holidays
 

 •  interest rate adjustments

Group II:
 

 •  partial forgiveness
 

 •  conversion of debt to equity

For 2016 and 2015, the Company had net charge-offs totaling $26.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, related to loans previously classified as
a TDR. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had not removed the TDR classification from any loan previously identified as such, but had
charged-off, sold and received repayments of outstanding TDRs.

The Company measures TDRs similarly to how it measures all loans for impairment. The Company performs a discounted cash flow analysis on
cash flow dependent loans and assesses the underlying collateral value less reasonable costs of sale for collateral dependent loans. Management analyzes
the projected performance of the borrower to determine if it has the ability to service principal and interest payments based on the terms of the
restructuring. Loans will typically not be returned to accrual status until at least six months of contractual payments have been made in a timely manner
or the borrower shows significant ability to maintain servicing of the restructured debt. Additionally, at the time of a restructuring and quarterly
thereafter, an impairment analysis is undertaken to determine the measurement of specific reserve, if any, on each impaired loan.

Below is a summary of the Company’s loans which were classified as TDR:

A general allowance is provided for loans and leases within the amortized portfolio that are not impaired. The Company employs a variety of
internally developed and third-party modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk, which are used in developing an allowance for loan and
lease losses on outstanding loans and leases held at amortized cost. The Company’s allowance framework addresses economic conditions, capital market
liquidity and industry circumstances from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective. The Company considers and evaluates a number of factors,
including but not limited to, changes in economic conditions, credit availability, industry, loss emergence period, and multiple obligor concentrations in
assessing both probabilities of default and loss severities as part of the general component of the allowance for loan and lease losses. The Company
continually evaluates the appropriateness of its allowance for credit losses methodology. Based on the Company’s evaluation process to determine the
level of the allowance for loan and lease losses, management believes the allowance to be adequate as of December 31, 2016 in light of the estimated
known and inherent risks identified through its analysis.

The Company closely monitors the credit quality of its loans and leases which is partly reflected in its credit metrics such as loan delinquencies,
non-accruals and charge-offs. Changes in these credit metrics are largely due to changes in economic conditions and seasoning of the loan and lease
portfolio.

On at least a quarterly basis, loans and leases are internally risk-rated based on individual credit criteria, including loan and lease type, loan and
lease structures (including balloon and bullet structures common in the Company’s Leveraged Finance and Real Estate cash flow loans), borrower
industry, payment capacity, location and quality of collateral if any (including the Company’s Real Estate loans). Borrowers provide the Company with
financial information on either a monthly or quarterly basis. Ratings, corresponding assumed default rates and assumed loss severities are dynamically
updated to reflect any changes in borrower condition and/or profile.

For Leveraged Finance loans and Equipment Finance loans and leases (prior to the latter being sold), the data set used to construct probabilities of
default in its allowance for loan losses model, Moody’s CRD Private Firm Database, primarily contains middle market loans that share attributes similar
to the Company’s loans. The Company also considers the quality of the loan or lease terms and lender protections in determining a loan loss in the event
of default.

For Real Estate loans, the Company employs two mechanisms to capture the impact of industry and economic conditions. First, a loan’s risk
rating, and thereby its assumed default likelihood, can be adjusted to

account for overall commercial real estate market conditions. Second, to the extent that economic or industry trends adversely affect a substandard rated
borrower’s loan-to-value ratio enough to impact its repayment ability, the Company applies a stress multiplier to the loan’s probability of default. The
multiplier is designed to account for default characteristics that are difficult to quantify when market conditions cause commercial real estate prices to
decline.

Prior to the sale of Business Credit, the Company utilized a proprietary model to risk rate the loans on a monthly basis. This model captured the
impact of changes in industry and economic conditions as well as changes in the quality of the borrower’s collateral and financial performance to assign
a final risk rating. The Company also evaluated historical net loss trends by risk rating from a comprehensive industry database covering more than
twenty-five years of experience of the majority of the asset based lenders operating in the United States. Based upon the monthly risk rating from the
model, the reserve was adjusted to reflect the historical average for expected loss from the industry database.

For consolidated VIEs to which the Company had provided transitional capital, we utilized a qualitative analysis which considered the business
plans related to the entity, including expected hold periods, the terms of the agreements related to the entity, the Company’s historical credit experience,
the credit migration of the entity’s loans to determine expected loss, as well as conditions in the capital markets.

The Company provided capital on a transitional basis to the Arlington Fund, prior to the completion of its term debt securitization on June 26,
2014. During the transitional hold period, the expected and actual loss on the Arlington Fund was zero and no allowance was recorded. The Company
deconsolidated the Arlington Fund on June 26, 2014. The Company did not recognize any losses on loans on the date of deconsolidation.

If the Company determines that changes in its allowance for credit losses methodology are advisable, as a result of changes in the economic
environment or otherwise, the revised allowance methodology may result in higher or lower levels of allowance. Moreover, given uncertain market
conditions, actual losses under the Company’s current or any revised allowance methodology may differ materially from the Company’s estimate.

Table of Contents

Included in the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2016 and 2015 is an allowance for unfunded commitments of $0.5 million, which is
recorded as a component of other liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet with changes recorded in the provision for credit losses on the
Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The methodology for determining the allowance for unfunded commitments is consistent with the
methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses.

During 2016, the Company recorded a total provision for credit losses of $27.5 million. The Company decreased its allowance for credit losses to
$51.4 million as of December 31, 2016 from $58.7 million at December 31, 2015. The Company had $33.0 million of net charge-offs and increased its
general allowance for credit losses by 10 basis points during 2016, and recorded new specific provisions for credit losses of $24.8 million. The general
allowance for credit losses covers probable losses incurred in the Company’s loan and lease amortized cost portfolio with respect to loans and leases for
which no specific impairment has been identified. When a loan is classified as impaired, the loan is evaluated for a specific allowance and a specific
provision may be recorded, thereby removing it from consideration under the general component of the allowance analysis. Loans that are deemed to be
uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance, and recoveries on loans previously charged off are netted against loans charged off. A
specific provision for credit losses is recorded with respect to impaired loans for which it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all
amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement for which there is impairment recognized. The outstanding balance of
impaired loans, which include all of the outstanding balances of the Company’s delinquent loans and its TDRs, as a percentage of “Loans and leases,
net” was 4% as of December 31, 2016 and 6% as of December 31, 2015.

As a result of the Company’s evaluation of the securities, management concluded that the unrealized losses at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were
caused by changes in market prices driven by interest rates and credit spreads. The Company’s evaluation of impairment include quotes from third party
pricing services, adjustments to prepayment speeds, delinquency, an analysis of expected cash flows, interest rates, market discount rates,

other contract terms, and the timing and level of losses on the loans and leases within the underlying trusts. At December 31, 2016, the Company has
determined that it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the securities before the Company recovers its amortized cost basis in the
security. The Company has also determined that there has not been an adverse change in the cash flows expected to be collected. Based upon the
Company’s impairment review process, and the Company’s ability and intent to hold these securities until maturity or a recovery of fair value, the
decline in the value of these investments is not considered to be Other Than Temporary. The Company did not record any net OTTI during 2016, 2015
or 2014.

Maturities of debt securities classified as available-for-sale were as follows at December 31, 2016 and 2015:

Table of Contents

The balance of goodwill at December 31, 2016 and 2015 is a result of the October 7, 2015 FOC Partners acquisition (Note 3).

Identified intangible assets consist of customer contracts resulting from the FOC Partners acquisition. The gross carrying amount of the identified
intangible assets at December 31, 2016 was $0.6 million. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over their expected economic useful life
which we estimate to be approximately 33 months. Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, amounted to $0.3 million
and $0.5 million, respectively. There was no amortization expense for the same period in 2014.

Note 9. Borrowings

Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2016 the Company had two credit facilities through certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries: (i) a $615.0 million credit
facility with syndicated lenders agented by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) to fund leveraged finance loans and (ii) a
$250.0 million credit facility with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) to fund leveraged finance loans.

The Company must comply with various covenants under these facilities. The breach of certain of these covenants could result in a termination
event and the exercise of remedies if not cured. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. These covenants are
customary and vary depending on the type of facility. These covenants include, but are not limited to, failure to service debt obligations, failure to meet
liquidity covenants and tangible net worth covenants, and failure to remain within prescribed facility portfolio delinquency, charge-off levels, and
overcollateralization tests.

The Company has a $615.0 million credit facility with syndicated lenders agented by Wells Fargo to fund leveraged finance loans. The credit
facility had an outstanding balance of $401.1 million and unamortized deferred financing fees of $6.4 million as of December 31, 2016. In February
2016 and June 2016, the Company upsized this facility, which increased the commitment amount from $475.0 million to $615.0 million. Interest on this
facility accrues at a variable rate per annum. The facility matures on August 10, 2020. The facility provides for a revolving reinvestment period which
ends on August 10, 2018, with a two-year amortization period.

The Company has a $250.0 million credit facility with Citibank to fund leveraged finance loans. The credit facility had an outstanding balance of
$53.2 million and unamortized deferred financing fees of $2.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Interest on this facility accrues at a variable rate per
annum. The facility provides for a revolving reinvestment period that ends on May 5, 2018, with a two-year amortization period.

On December 1, 2016, the Company sold the assets of Equipment Finance and the related platform. In connection with the sale, the company
repaid all outstanding indebtedness of Equipment Finance, including amounts outstanding under its $75.0 million note purchase agreement with Wells
Fargo, with an outstanding balance of $16.9 million.

In September 15, 2016, the Company repaid the $350.0 million note purchase agreement with Credit Suisse that provided the financing to fund the
purchase of broadly syndicated bank loans during the warehouse phase of the Arch Street CLO. The supplemental junior note commitment by NewStar
Capital was also repaid in full. The notes were repaid from proceeds of the Arch Street CLO bond issuance.

On March 31, 2016, the Company sold its membership interest in Business Credit. In connection with the sale, the Company repaid all
outstanding indebtedness of Business Credit, including amounts outstanding under the $175.0 million credit facility with a syndicate of lenders agented
by DZ Bank AG Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftbank Frankfurt (“DZ Bank”) with an outstanding balance of $102.0 million and the $165.0 million
credit facility with a syndicate of lenders agented by Wells Fargo with an outstanding balance of $135.4 million, each of which was terminated. The
Company accelerated and recognized deferred financing fees of $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, related to the warehouse facilities during the
first quarter of 2016.

Senior notes

On April 22, 2015, the Company issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). On
November 9, 2015, the Company issued an additional $80.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes. The 2020 Notes issued on
November 9, 2015, were issued at a debt discount of $0.8 million which will amortize over the life of the 2020 Notes. The Company used a portion of
the net proceeds from the April notes offering to repay in full its corporate credit facility with Fortress Credit Corp. The 2020 Notes mature on May 1,
2020, and bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per annum, which is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. At any time prior to
May 1, 2017, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain public
equity offerings at a price equal to 107.25% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon provided that
immediately following the redemption, at least 65% of the 2020 Notes that were originally issued remain outstanding. Additionally, at any time prior to
May 1, 2017, the Company may redeem some or all of the 2020 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and a make-whole premium. On or after May 1, 2017, the Company may redeem the 2020 Notes, in whole or in part, at
redemption prices specified in the 2020 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In addition, if the Company undergoes a change of control, the
Company will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 2020 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes,
plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2016 unamortized deferred financing fees were $5.5 million.

Subordinated notes

On December 4, 2014, the Company completed the initial closing of an investment of long-term capital from funds sponsored by Franklin Square
Capital Partners (“Franklin Square”) and sub-advised by GSO Capital Partners at which the Franklin Square funds purchased $200.0 million of 10-year
subordinated notes (the “Subordinated Notes”), which rank junior to the Company’s existing and future senior debt. During 2015, the Company drew an
additional $75 million of these Subordinated Notes. The Company drew the remaining $25 million in January 2016. The Subordinated Notes were
recorded at par less the initial relative fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the investment on December 4, 2014 and January 23, 2015
which was $53.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and $60.0 million as of December 31, 2015. The debt discount will amortize over the life of the notes
and will be recorded as non-cash interest expense as the Subordinated Notes accrete to par value. As of December 31, 2016, unamortized deferred
financing fees were $4.9 million. The Subordinated Notes bear interest at 8.25% and include a Payment-in-Kind (“PIK Toggle”) feature that allows the
Company, at its option, to elect to have interest accrued at a rate of 8.75% added to the principal of the Subordinated Notes instead of paying it in cash.
The Subordinated Notes have a ten-year term and mature on December 4, 2024. They are callable during the first three years with payment of a make-
whole premium. The prepayment premium decreases to 103% and 101% after the third and fourth anniversaries of the closing, respectively. They are
callable at par after December 4, 2019. The Subordinated Notes require a mandatory payment at the end of each accrual period, beginning on
December 5, 2019. The Company is required to make a cash payment of principal plus accrued interest in an amount required to prevent the
Subordinated Notes from being treated as an “Applicable High Yield Discount Obligation” within the meaning of Section 163(i)(1) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Events of default under the Subordinated Notes include failure to pay interest or principal when due subject to
applicable grace periods, material uncured breaches of the terms of the Subordinated Notes, and bankruptcy/insolvency events.

Term Debt Securitizations

2012-2 CLO. On December 18, 2012, the Company completed a term debt securitization transaction. In conjunction with this transaction the
Company established a separate single-purpose bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, NewStar Commercial Loan Funding 2012-2 LLC (the “2012-2 CLO”)
and sold and contributed $325.9 million in loans and investments (including unfunded commitments), or portions thereof, to the 2012-2

CLO. The Company remains the servicer of the loans. Simultaneously with the initial sale and contribution, the 2012-2 CLO issued $263.3 million of
notes to institutional investors. The Company retained $62.6 million, comprising 100% of the 2012-2 CLO’s membership interests, Class E notes,
Class F notes, and subordinated notes. On June 12, 2015, the Company sold 100% of the 2012-2 CLO’s Class E Notes totaling $16.3 million to
institutional investors. At December 31, 2016, the $233.0 million of outstanding drawn notes were collateralized by the specific loans and investments,
principal collection account cash and principal payment receivables totaling $279.2 million. At December 31, 2016, deferred financing fees were
$0.7 million. The 2012-2 CLO permitted reinvestment of collateral principal repayments for a three-year period which ended January 2016.

The Company receives a loan collateral management fee and excess interest spread. The Company also receives payments with respect to the
classes of notes it owns in accordance with the transaction documents. The Company expects to receive a principal distribution as owner of the
membership interests when the term debt is retired. If loan collateral in the 2012-2 CLO is in default under the terms of the indenture, the excess interest
spread from the 2012-2 CLO may not be distributed if the overcollateralization ratio, or other collateral quality tests, are not satisfied.

2014-1 CLO. On April 17, 2014, the Company completed a term debt securitization transaction through its separate single-purpose bankruptcy-
remote subsidiary, NewStar Commercial Loan Funding 2014-1 LLC (the “2014-1 CLO”) and sold and contributed $249.6 million in loans and
investments (including unfunded commitments), or portions thereof, to the 2014-1 CLO. The Company remains the servicer of the loans.
Simultaneously with the initial sale and contribution, the 2014-1 CLO issued $289.5 million of notes to institutional investors. The Company retained
$58.9 million, comprising 100% of the 2014-1 CLO’s membership interests, Class E notes, Class F notes, and subordinated notes. At December 31,
2016, the $289.5 million of outstanding drawn notes were collateralized by the specific loans and investments, principal collection account cash and
principal payment receivables totaling $348.4 million. At December 31, 2016, deferred financing fees were $2.0 million. The 2014-1 CLO permits
reinvestment of collateral principal repayments for a four-year period ending in April 2018. Should the Company determine that reinvestment of
collateral principal repayments are impractical in light of market conditions or if collateral principal repayments are not reinvested within a prescribed

Warrants

On December 4, 2014, the Company issued warrants to purchase 9,500,000 million shares of its common stock as part of the strategic relationship
with Franklin Square Capital Partners (“Franklin Square”). Each warrant allows the warrant holder to purchase one share of the Company’s common
stock at a purchase price equal to $12.62 per share. The warrants were deemed to be freestanding and indexed to the Company’s common stock. As such
they were recorded at relative fair value, with no required subsequent re-measurement. The warrants expire on December 4, 2024. At December 31,
2016, the warrants had a fair value of $63.6 million, net of assumed transaction costs.

On January 23, 2015, the Company completed its issuance of warrants as part of the strategic relationship with Franklin Square. The Company

years.

Stock Options

Under the Company’s 2006 Incentive Plan, the Company’s compensation committee may grant options to purchase shares of common stock.
Stock options may either be incentive stock options (“ISOs”) or non-qualified stock options. ISOs may only be granted to officers and employees. The
compensation committee will, with regard to each stock option, determine the number of shares subject to the stock option, the manner and time of
exercise, vesting, and the exercise price, which will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. The
shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of options or other awards or upon grant of any other award may be either previously authorized but
unissued shares or treasury shares.

On May 12, 2010, stock options exercisable for an aggregate of 629,105 shares of common stock were issued to certain employees of the
Company. The stock options have an exercise price of $8.28, which is equal to

Note 13. Earnings Per Share

The Company utilizes the two-class method to calculate earnings per share. The two-class method allocates net income to each class of common
stock and participating security. Unvested share-based payment awards granted to certain employees and board members entitle holders to the same
rights as outstanding and vested common stock. These securities are considered to be participating securities and are included in the allocation for

computing earnings per share under this method. Income is allocated to common shareholders and participating securities under the two-class method
based upon the proportion of each to the total weighted average shares available.

The computations of basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:

Warrants to purchase common stock totaling 12,000,000 were not included in the computation of earnings per share for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015 due to the fact that the results would be anti-dilutive.

Note 14. Variable Interest Entity

On October 1, 2015, the Company adopted ASU 2015-2, Consolidation—Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis which revised the existing
consolidation guidance and required the Company to re-evaluate its consolidation conclusions under the new model. The new consolidation model
revised the conditions required for consolidation, the criteria to be considered a variable interest entity and the determination of the primary beneficiary.
The Company’s involvement in VIEs includes term debt securitizations and sponsored funds.

The Company sponsors the formation of various entities that are considered to be VIEs. The majority of these VIEs were formed to issue term
debt securitizations. The assets of the VIEs are primarily comprised of senior secured loans and the liabilities are primarily comprised of debt. The
Company’s determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE is based in part on an assessment of whether or not the Company is
exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards of the entity. In instances where the Company retains a significant portion of the equity and remains the
servicer of the loans, it was determined that the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance
of these VIEs. Additionally, the Company determined that the potential fees that it could receive directly or indirectly from these VIEs represent rights
to returns that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. As a result, the Company was deemed the primary beneficiary and therefore has consolidated
these entities. VIEs that have been consolidated are disclosed in Note 9.

Unconsolidated VIEs

In November 2016, NewStar closed a new managed credit fund, NewStar Berkeley Fund CLO LLC (the “Berkeley Fund”), a $505 million term
debt securitization. The Berkeley Fund is the fourth credit fund established by the Company to co-invest in directly originated middle market
commercial loans. To comply with European Union (“EU”) risk retention rules, the Company holds 5% of each class of notes in the securitization
(vertical strip), totaling $25.3 million. The Berkeley Fund employs an independent investment professional who is responsible for investment decision
making on behalf of the fund. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the Berkeley Fund and will not consolidate the
Berkeley Fund’s operating results or statements of financial position; however, the Company has determined that it has a variable interest in the
Berkeley Fund as it holds notes of the securitization.

In January 2015, NewStar closed a new managed credit fund, NewStar Clarendon Fund CLO LLC (the “Clarendon Fund”), a $400.0 million term
debt securitization. The Clarendon Fund is the third credit fund established by the Company to co-invest in directly originated middle market
commercial loans. To comply with EU risk retention rules, the Company holds 5% of each class of notes in the securitization (vertical strip), totaling
$20.4 million. The Clarendon Fund employs an independent investment professional who is responsible for investment decision making on behalf of the
fund. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the Clarendon Fund and will not consolidate the Clarendon Fund’s operating
results or statements of financial position; however, the Company has determined it has a variable interest in the Clarendon Fund as it holds notes of the
securitization.

In October 2015, NewStar acquired FOC Partners, which now operates as NewStar Capital. At acquisition, NewStar Capital was the investment
manager for six collateralized loan obligations and two sponsored funds and provided discretionary services to a series of separately managed accounts.
The Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of any of acquired CLOs, sponsored funds or separately managed accounts; however,
the Company determined that it had a variable interest in a fund as it holds approximately one percent of the interest of the fund.

The following table sets forth the information with respect to the unconsolidated VIEs for which the Company holds a variable interest in as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015:

Former Unconsolidated VIEs

In April 2013, the Company formed a new managed credit fund, NewStar Arlington Fund LLC (“Arlington Fund”) in partnership with an
institutional investor to co-invest in middle market commercial loans originated by the Company’s Leveraged Finance group. As the managing member
of the Arlington Fund, the Company retained full discretion over Arlington Fund’s investment decisions, subject to usual and customary limitations, and
earned management fees as compensation for its services. For 2014, the management fee was $0.5 million.

On April 4, 2013, Arlington Fund entered into an agreement establishing $147.0 million of Class A variable funding notes (the “Class A Notes”)
and $28.0 million of Class B variable funding notes (the “Class B Notes”) to partially fund eligible middle market loan origination for Arlington Fund.

Table of Contents

Association funded the Class A Notes as the initial Class A lender and the Company funded the Class B Notes as the initial Class B lender. For 2014,
interest expense on the Class B Notes totaled $0.7 million. For 2014, the Fund distributed excess cash to its institutional investor totaling $0.7 million.

From inception, the Company was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of Arlington Fund and, therefore, consolidated the financial results of
Arlington Fund with the Company’s results of operations and statements of financial position since April 2013.

On June 26, 2014, the NewStar Arlington Senior Loan Program LLC (the “Arlington Program”) completed a $409.4 million term debt
securitization comprised of all of the Arlington Fund’s loans as well as a portion of the Company’s loans classified as held-for-sale. A portion of the
proceeds from this term debt securitization were used to repay all advances under the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes. Following repayment, the
Class A Notes and the Class B Notes were redeemed. As a result, the amortization of $1.1 million of deferred financing fees was accelerated and
recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2014. The Company’s membership interests in Arlington Fund were also redeemed and new
membership interests in the Arlington Program were issued to its equity investors. The Company did not recognize a gain or a loss on the redemption of
its membership interests in the Arlington Fund. The Company acts as collateral manager for the Arlington Program. As a result of the repayment of the
Company’s advances as the Class B lender under the warehouse facility and the redemption of its membership interests in the Arlington Fund, the
Company has no ownership or financial interests in the Arlington Fund or its successors except to the extent that it receives management fees as
collateral manager of the Arlington Program. Additionally, the Arlington Program employs an independent investment professional who is responsible
for investment decision making on behalf of the program. As a result, the Company deconsolidated the Arlington Fund from its statements of financial
position beginning on June 26, 2014. The Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the Arlington Program and will not consolidate
the Arlington Program’s operating results or statements of financial position as of that date.

Although the Company consolidated all of the assets and liabilities of Arlington Fund during the period from April 4, 2013 through June 26, 2014,
its maximum exposure to loss was limited to its investments in membership interests in Arlington Fund, its Class B Note receivable, as well as the
management fee receivable from Arlington Fund. These items defined the Company’s economic relationship with Arlington Fund but were eliminated
upon consolidation. The Company managed the assets of Arlington Fund solely for the benefit of its lenders and investors. If the Company were to have
liquidated, the assets of Arlington Fund would not have been available to the Company’s general creditors. Conversely, the investors in the debt of
Arlington Fund had no recourse to the Company’s general assets. Therefore, the Company did not consider this debt its obligation.

During the period from April 4, 2013 through June 26, 2014 when the Company consolidated the Arlington Fund as a VIE, the membership
interests representing equity ownership of Arlington Fund were characterized as debt in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial position. The
Company applied an imputed interest rate to that debt and recorded the resulting interest expense in its consolidated statement of operations. In the
consolidation, the Company eliminated the economic results of its related portion of the membership interests and the applied interest expense from its
results of operations and statements of financial position. As a result of the re-evaluation of the Company’s VIEs, the Arlington Program is no longer
considered a VIE.

Note 15. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk

The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its
borrowers. These financial instruments include unfunded commitments and standby letters of credit. The instruments involve, to varying degrees,
elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments
reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.

The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for standby letters of credit is
represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The

Table of Contents

Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.

Unused lines of credit are commitments to lend to a borrower if certain conditions have been met. These commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Because certain commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the
total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each borrower’s creditworthiness on a
case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral required is based on factors that include management’s credit evaluation of the borrower and the borrower’s
compliance with financial covenants. Due to their fluctuating nature, the Company cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts that will be
required to fund its unfunded commitments. The aggregate amount of these unfunded commitments may exceed the Company’s available funds.

At December 31, 2016, the Company had $326.1 million of unused lines of credit. Of these unused lines of credit, unfunded commitments related
to revolving credit facilities were $257.5 million and unfunded commitments related to delayed draw term loans were $68.6 million. These
commitments may expire without being drawn upon as such the total commitment does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending credit to our borrowers. Standby letters of
credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance by a borrower to a third party.

Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk are summarized as follows:

Note 16. Total Return Swap

The Company was a participant in a Total Return Swap (“TRS”), which matured on March 31, 2016. We acted as the manager of the TRS and
selected the specific loans to be subject to the TRS. The TRS did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as it did not offset the risks of another
investment position.

The underlying referenced loan portfolio of the TRS was primarily large, liquid, broadly syndicated senior secure floating rate loans with
Citibank, N.A. as the counterparty. The TRS effectively added leverage to the Company’s portfolio by providing economic benefits of the loans subject
to the TRS, despite the fact that such loans were not directly owned the Company, in return for an interest-type payment to Citibank.

On December 4, 2014, NewStar TRS I LLC, a newly-formed subsidiary of the Company, entered into a total return swap of senior secured
floating rate loans with Citibank, N.A. The initial maximum market value (determined at the time such loan became subject to the TRS) of the portfolio
of loans subject to the TRS was $75.0 million. On March 2, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the TRS that increased the maximum value to
$150.0 million, and on July 14, 2015, we entered into an additional amendment to the TRS that increased the maximum value to $175.0 million.

Upon maturity of the TRS on March 31, 2016, the Company purchased $138.9 million of the loans in the referenced portfolio. The majority of
these loans were purchased to fund future CLOs of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary NewStar Capital. The Company recorded these loans
at fair value which was determined by using the midpoint of the bid-ask spread provided by an independent third-party pricing service.

TRS receivable    1,377    —   

The fair value of the TRS was reflected as an unrealized gain or loss on the total return swap on the consolidated balance sheet, within other assets
or liabilities. The change in value of the TRS was reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as loss on total return swap.

As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of the underlying referenced portfolio was $155.6 million.

The Company’s obligations under the TRS were non-recourse to it, and its exposure was limited to the value of the cash collateral which
fluctuated from time to time depending on the market value of the underlying loans. The Company was required to cash collateralize a specified
percentage of each loan included under the TRS in accordance with margin requirements. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had cash
collateral on deposit with Citibank of $0 and $56.5 million, respectively.

The Company paid interest to Citibank for each loan at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.60% per annum. Upon the termination or
repayment of any loan under the TRS Agreement, the Company would deduct the appreciation of such loan’s value from any interest owed to Citibank
or pay the depreciation amount to Citibank in addition to remaining interest payments.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had net deferred tax assets of $40.8 million and $33.1 million, respectively. In assessing the realizability
of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company’s management considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets at
December 31, 2016. Management considered carryback availability, the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income
during the reversal periods, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Management also considered our recent history of taxable income,
trends in our earnings, positive financial ratios, and the impact of the downturn in the current economic environment (including the impact of credit on
allowance and provision for loan losses) on the Company. Based upon its assessment, management believes that a valuation allowance was not
necessary as of December 31, 2016.

Note 18. Fair Value

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and disclosures, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The
valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are
defined as follows:
 

 •  Level 1—inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
 

 
•  Level 2—inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are

observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
 

 •  Level 3—inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, including the general classification of
such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

Items Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Investments in debt securities, available-for-sale

Investments in debt securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value measurement of investments in debt
securities is based on third party pricing services or by using internally developed financial models. For securities in less liquid markets where there is
limited activity and little transparency around broker quotes used to value such securities, the Company classifies securities valued using broker quotes
as Level 3. If quoted prices are not available, then fair value is estimated by using internally developed financial models. These securities are not
actively traded and require a private sale, and the valuation involves application of significant management judgment. Inputs into the model-based
valuations can include changes in market indexes, selling prices of similar securities, management’s assumptions related to the credit rating of the
security, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions and management’s assessment of the current market conditions. Such
securities are classified as Level 3, as the valuation models are based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.

Loans

Loans designated to Credit Funds managed by NewStar Capital are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company has elected to apply
fair value option accounting to these loans which is consistent with the manner in which the Credit Funds are managed. The fair value of these loans are
based on third party pricing services. These loans are classified as Level 2. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded
a $5.5 million gain from the change in fair value which was recorded in other miscellaneous income, net.

Table of Contents

Total return swap

The fair value of the total return swap was based on third party pricing services who collect prices through a variety of methods including dealer
runs, indicative sheets and online posts. The Company recorded the total return swap with Citibank as Level 2. At December 31, 2016, the Company no
longer participated in the TRS. At December 31, 2015, the TRS was included within Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The TRS had a
maximum notional amount of $175.0 million and was carried at an estimated fair value of $(4.4) million, comprised of $1.4 million of interest
receivable and an unrealized loss of $5.8 million on the underlying loan portfolio.

Contingent Liability

The contingent liability relating to potential credit indemnification obligations in connection with the Equipment Finance sale is recorded at fair
value on a recurring basis. The measurement of the contingent liability is based on the Company’s periodic portfolio review of the then outstanding
loans and leases sold. The Company has an agreement with the third party buyer to provide a review of the portfolio on a periodic basis. The Company
uses the portfolio review, historical knowledge of the portfolio, changes in market indexes, management’s assumptions related to the credit rating,
prepayment and collateral value assumptions and other factors such as current market conditions to calculate management’s best estimate of expected
losses. This contingent liability is classified as a Level 3.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Collateral dependent impaired loans

Collateral dependent loans that are deemed to be impaired are valued based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral. For collateral
dependent loans for which repayment is dependent on the sale of the collateral, management adjusts the fair value for estimated costs to sell. For
collateral dependent loans for which repayment is dependent on the operation of the collateral, management may also adjust values to reflect estimated
market value declines or apply other discounts to appraised values. Collateral dependent impaired loans are categorized as Level 3. During the twelve
months ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $4.3 million of specific allowance for credit losses related to “Collateral dependent impaired
loans” measured at fair value at December 31, 2016, of which $4.2 million was subsequently charged off when the impaired loans were transferred to
the held-for-sale portfolio. During 2015, the Company recorded $0.3 million of specific allowance for credit losses related to “Collateral dependent
impaired loans” measured at fair value.

Loans held-for-sale

Loans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Loans held-for-sale measured at fair value may consist of loans that have had
credit downgrades and/or have remained in the loans held-for-sale portfolio for a significant period of time. When fair value is determined to be the
carrying value, the fair values of these loans are obtained through a third party pricing service or by using internally developed financial models. Inputs
into the model-based valuations can include changes in market indexes, selling prices of similar loans, management’s assumption related to the credit
rating of the loan, prepayment assumptions and other factors, such as credit loss assumptions. Where quoted market prices are obtained through dealer
quotes, broker indicative prices or online posts, loans held-for-sale are classified as Level 2. Loans held-for-sale are classified as Level 3 in instances
where valuation models are based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the
Company recorded a $2.4 million gain related to “Loans, held-for-sale” measured at fair value. During 2015, the Company recorded a $2.6 million loss
related to “Loans, held-for-sale” measured at fair value.

Other real estate owned or repossessed assets

The fair value of other real estate owned or repossessed assets is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value, market value
of similar properties, liquidation value and discounted cash flows.

Management may adjust the fair value for estimated costs to sell or adjust values to reflect estimated market value declines or apply other discounts to
values. The Company records the other real estate owned and repossessed assets as Level 3. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the
Company recorded a $0.3 million expense to write down other real estate owned to fair value.

Changes in Level 3 recurring fair value measurements

The table below illustrates the change in balance sheet amounts during 2016 and 2015 (including the change in fair value), for financial
instruments measured on a recurring basis and classified by the Company as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy. When a determination is made to
classify a financial instrument as Level 3, the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value
measurement. However, Level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or Level 3 components, observable components
(that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include
changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Company did not transfer any financial
instruments in or out of Level 1, 2, or 3 during 2016 and 2015.

The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis are
discussed above. The methodologies for other financial instruments are discussed below.

Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash collateral on deposit with custodians: The carrying amounts approximate fair value because
of the short maturity of these instruments.

Credit facilities: Due to the adjustable rate nature of the borrowings, the fair values of the credit facilities are estimated to approximate their
carrying values. Rates currently are comparable to those offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities by the
Company’s lenders.

Term debt securitizations: The fair value was determined by applying prevailing term debt securitization market interest rates to the Company’s
current term debt securitization structure.

Table of Contents

Repurchase agreements: The fair value was determined by applying prevailing repurchase agreement market interest rates to the Company’s
current repurchase agreement structure.

Senior notes: The fair value was based on available quoted market prices.

Subordinated notes: The fair value was estimated as the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at market interest rates on similar
debt instruments, issued by companies with comparable credit ratings.

Other assets/other liabilities: Comprised of non-public investments, contingent liability and through March 31, 2016, the total return swap. The
non-public investments are carried within other assets at $16.0 million and $14.3 million, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These
investments are in the form of equity or warrants and are obtained as part of the loan origination process. The investments are initially recorded at cost
and reviewed quarterly. If the fair value is less than cost then the investment is written down to fair value with the necessary adjustment recorded
through current earnings. Fair value is determined using internally developed valuation models. Where sufficient data exists, a market approach method
is utilized to estimate the current value of the underlying company. The estimated fair value of the underlying securities for warrants requiring valuation
at fair value is adjusted for discounts related to lack of liquidity. The Company classifies equity and warrants as Level 3. The contingent liability was
included in other liabilities as of December 31, 2016. Its fair value was based on periodic portfolio review and various assumptions used by
management. The Company classifies the contingent liability as Level 3. The total return swap, which was included in other liabilities as of
December 31, 2015, was based on third party pricing services who collect prices through a variety of methods including dealer runs, indicative sheets
and online posts. The Company classified the total return swap as Level 2.

Note 19. Employee Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a contributory 401(k) plan covering all full-time employees. The Company matches 100% of an employee’s voluntary
contributions up to a limit of 6% of the employee’s base salary, subject to IRS guidelines. Expense for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $0.7 million,
$0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively.

Note 20. Segment Reporting

Beginning in 2016, the Company has two reportable segments, Commercial Lending and Asset Management. Segment information is derived
from the internal reporting system utilized by management. Revenues and expenses for segments reflect those revenue and expenses which can be
specifically identified and have been assigned based on internally developed allocation methods. Results may be restated, when necessary, to reflect
changes in organizational structure or allocation methodology. Any changes in allocations that may affect the reported results of any business segment
will not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company as a whole.

Commercial Lending

The Commercial Lending segment represents our direct lending activities which are focused on providing a range of flexible senior secured debt
options to mid-sized companies with annual cash flow (EBITDA) typically between $15 million and $50 million owned by private equity investment
funds and managed by established professional alternative asset managers.

Asset Management

The Asset Management segment represents our investment advisory activities which include credit funds managed by the Company and NewStar
Capital. Credit funds managed by the Company focus on middle market

Note 23. Subsequent Events

Dividend Policy

On February 14, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend. The first cash dividend of $0.02 per share is
expected to be paid on March 17, 2017 to stockholders of record on March 2, 2017. While it is the Company’s intention to pay quarterly cash dividends
for the foreseeable future, the amount, timing and frequency of any future dividend payments remains in the discretion of the Company’s Board of
Directors, taking into account the Company’s financial condition and results of operation, its capital needs, market conditions and other factors that the
board considers appropriate at the time. In addition, the indenture governing the Company’s senior notes imposes certain limitations on the Company’s
ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock or to make other restricted payments, including repurchasing its common stock.

Such limitations are calculated in part by reference to our consolidated net income, as calculated under the indenture. Our ability to declare dividends for
future periods thus depends on both its earnings and the amount of prior dividends, stock repurchases and other restricted payments.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)

Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of NewStar Financial, Inc., contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These are statements that relate to future periods and include statements
about:
 

 •  our anticipated financial condition, including estimated loan losses;
 

 •  our expected results of operation;
 

 •  our growth and market opportunities;
 

 •  trends and conditions in the financial markets in which we operate;
 

 •  our future funding needs and sources and availability of funding;
 

 •  our involvement in capital-raising transactions;
 

 •  our ability to meet draw requests under commitments to borrowers under certain conditions;
 

 •  our competitors;
 

 •  our provision for credit losses;
 

 •  our future development of our products and markets;
 

 •  our ability to compete;
 

 •  our stock price or dividend policy; and
 

 
•  the consummation of the transactions contemplated by our definitive merger agreement with First Eagle Holdings, Inc. (First Eagle) and our

asset purchase agreement with GSO Diamond Portfolio Holdco LLC (GSO), each of which is described in more detail in this Quarterly
Report.

Generally, the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “estimates,” “projects,” “plans” and similar expressions identify forward-looking
statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual
results, performance, achievements or industry results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by
these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other important factors include, among others:
 

 
•  risk of deterioration in credit quality that could result in levels of delinquent or non-accrual loans that would force us to realize credit losses

exceeding our allowance for credit losses and deplete our cash position;
 

 •  risks and uncertainties relating to the financial markets generally, including disruptions in the global financial markets;
 

 •  uncertainties relating to the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time;
 

 •  risk and uncertainties related to our ability to obtain external financing;
 

 •  risk and uncertainties relating to the regulation of the commercial lending industry by federal, state and local governments;
 

 •  our ability to minimize losses, achieve profitability, and realize our deferred tax asset;
 

 •  the competitive nature of the commercial lending industry and our ability to effectively compete;
 

 
•  the failure to obtain the approval of the Company’s stockholders or required regulatory approvals or the failure to satisfy any other closing

conditions to the Merger Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement as defined and described under Note 17 in this Quarterly Report;

•  the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement or Asset Purchase

Agreement; and
 

 

•  potential disruption of management’s attention from our ongoing business operations due to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and Asset Purchase Agreement, the effect of the announcement of these transactions and the effect of the operating restrictions in
the transaction agreements on the ongoing operations of the Company and its relationship with its investors, funding sources, borrowers and
others with whom it does business.

For a further description of these and other risks and uncertainties, we encourage you to carefully read section Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as supplemented by the risks outline under Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q.

The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speak only as of the date of this report. We expressly disclaim any
obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report to reflect any
change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based,
except as may be required by law. Statements relating to past dividends or our current dividend policy should not be construed as a guarantee that any
future dividends will be paid.

NEWSTAR FINANCIAL, INC.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Unaudited

Note 1. Organization

NewStar Financial, Inc. (“NewStar”), together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”), is an internally-managed, middle
market direct lender and credit-oriented asset manager headquartered in Boston, MA. The Company’s direct lending activities are focused on meeting
the complex financing needs of companies and private investors in the middle market by offering a range of flexible debt financing options. The
Company also offers a range of investment management products employing credit-oriented strategies focused on middle market loans and liquid,
tradeable credit. The Company manages approximately $7.2 billion of assets, $3.6 billion held in consolidated subsidiaries of the Company and
$3.6 billion in off balance sheet credit funds.

NewStar operates its business through two reportable segments: Commercial Lending and Asset Management.

Commercial Lending

These lending activities require specialized skills and transaction experience, as well as a significant investment in personnel and operating
infrastructure. To meet these demands, our loans are originated directly by teams of credit-trained bankers. These teams are supported by centralized
credit management and operating platforms. This structure enables us to leverage common standards, systems, and industry and professional expertise
across the two segments.

The Company targets its marketing and origination efforts at private equity firms, mid-sized companies, corporate executives, banks and a variety
of other referral sources and financial intermediaries to develop new customer relationships and source lending opportunities. The Company’s
origination network is national in scope and it targets companies with business operations across a broad range of industry sectors. The Company
employs highly experienced bankers and credit professionals to identify and structure new lending opportunities and manage customer relationships.
The Company believes that the quality of its professionals, the breadth of their relationships and referral networks, and their ability to develop creative
solutions for customers position it to be a valued partner and preferred lender for mid-sized companies and private equity funds with middle market
investment strategies.

The Company’s emphasis on direct origination is an important aspect of its marketing and credit strategy. The Company’s national network is
designed around specialized origination channels intended to generate a large set of potential lending opportunities. That allows the Company to be
highly selective in its credit process and to allocate capital to market segments that we believe represent the most attractive opportunities. The
Company’s direct origination network also generates proprietary lending opportunities with yield characteristics that we believe would not otherwise be
available through intermediaries. In addition, direct origination provides the Company with direct access to management teams and enhances its ability
to conduct detailed due diligence and credit analysis of prospective borrowers. It also allows the Company to negotiate transaction terms directly with
borrowers and, as a result, advise its customers on financial strategies and capital structures, which it believes benefits its credit performance.

The size of financing commitments depends on various factors, including the type of loan, the credit characteristics of the borrower, the economic
characteristics of the loan, and the Company’s role in the transaction. The Company also arranges larger transactions that it may retain on its balance
sheet or syndicate to other lenders, which include off balance sheet managed credit funds managed by the Company for third party institutional
investors. By syndicating loans to other lenders and the Company’s off balance sheet managed credit

Table of Contents

funds, it is able to provide larger financing commitments to its customers and generate fee income, while limiting its risk exposure to single borrowers.

Asset Management

As a registered investment adviser, NewStar offers a range of investment products employing credit-oriented strategies focused on middle market
loans and liquid tradeable credit. The Company manages a series of private credit funds that co-invest in middle market loans originated through its
established leveraged finance lending platform. Through its registered investment adviser subsidiary, NewStar Capital, the Company also manages
assets across a series of CLOs that invest primarily in broadly syndicated loans, as well as other sponsored funds and managed accounts that invest
across various liquid, non-investment grade asset classes, including broadly syndicated loans and bonds.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

These interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and those variable interest
entities (“VIEs”) where the Company is the primary beneficiary. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to
the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes
required by GAAP for complete financial statements. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of
Management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for the fair presentation of the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements have been included. These interim condensed financial statements may not be indicative of financial results for the full
year. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain
reported amounts and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates most susceptible to
change in the near-term are the Company’s estimates of its (i) allowance for credit losses, (ii) recorded amounts of deferred income taxes, (iii) fair value
measurements used to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments, (iv) valuation of investments, (v) determination of other than
temporary impairments and temporary impairments and (vi) impairment of goodwill and identified intangible assets. The interim condensed
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2016.

As discussed in Note 17, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with First Eagle Holdings, Inc. and certain of its direct and indirect
subsidiaries, as a result of which the Company will become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of First Eagle. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by the agreement is subject to the approval of our stockholders, regulatory approvals, and other conditions. As a result, none of the
condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in this Form 10-Q consider the potential impact of the pending merger and related
transactions.

Principles of Consolidation

The Company consolidates entities in which it, directly or indirectly, is determined to have a controlling financial interest under ASC Topic 810,
as amended by ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation—Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which revised the existing consolidation guidance and
required the Company to re-evaluate whether to consolidate certain types of entities. The Company evaluates (1) whether it holds a variable interest in
an entity, (2) whether the entity is a VIE, and (3) whether the Company’s involvement would make it the primary beneficiary.

Table of Contents

Investments in Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

The Company sponsors the formation of various entities that are considered to be VIEs. The majority of these VIEs were formed to issue term
debt securitizations used to fund the Company’s lending activities. The assets of the VIEs are primarily comprised of senior secured loans and the
liabilities are primarily comprised of asset backed securities. In instances where the Company retains 100% of the equity interests and services the loans,
the Company is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE and consolidates the entities.

Investments in Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities and Other Unconsolidated Entities

The Company also holds variable interests in certain VIEs that are not consolidated because the Company is not considered the primary
beneficiary, including its investments in certain managed credit funds and CLOs. The Company’s involvement with such entities is in the form of equity
interests that the Company has deemed more than insignificant and/or asset management fees for services provided. In instances where the Company
holds equity interests, those interests are held on our balance sheet and included in Investments in Debt Securities, Available-for-Sale.

The Company manages a series of other entities and separately managed accounts for third parties. The Company receives fees for services
performed with respect to such entities, which the Company has determined are not variable interests. These fees earned by the Company are included in
asset management income.

Investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities and other unconsolidated entities are referred to in this Quarterly Report as off balance
sheet managed credit funds.

Prior Period Reclassification

Prior period amounts are reclassified wherever necessary to conform with current period presentation.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740). ASU 2015-17 eliminates the requirement to separate deferred
income tax liabilities into current and non-current classification in a classified balance sheet. It further requires that all deferred income taxes be
classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period
beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company adopted ASU 2015-17 on January 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have an impact on
its consolidated financial statements as the Company does not classify its deferred income tax liabilities into current and non-current on its Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting (Topic 323). ASU 2016-07
eliminates the requirement for an investor to retroactively apply the equity method when its increase in ownership interest (or degree of influence) in an
investee triggers equity method accounting. ASU 2016-07 is effective for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-07 on January 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 did not impact its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718). ASU 2016-09
simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and
statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of related amounts within the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for
annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 on January 1,
2017 and elected to continue to estimate forfeitures. The Company’s adoption was prospective, therefore, prior periods have not been adjusted. The

ASU 2016-09 could result in increased volatility to reported income tax expense related to excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies for employee share-
based transactions, however, the actual amounts recognized in income tax expense will be dependent on the amount of employee share-based
transactions and the stock price at the time of vesting or exercise. For the first quarter of 2017, the adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in a decrease to the
provision for income taxes, primarily due to the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock. The presentation of
excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows shifted to an operating activity from the prior classification as a financing activity.

In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-19, Technical Corrections and Improvements. ASU 2016-19 includes amendments to provide
guidance clarification and references corrections and provide minor structural changes to headings or minor editing to text to improve usefulness and
understandability. ASU 2016-19 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 31, 2016. The
Company adopted ASU 2016-19 as of January 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016-19 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. ASU 2017-01
clarifies the definition of a business to assist with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or
businesses. ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, with early
adoption permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-01 as a result of the Fifth Street CLO Management LLC acquisition. The adoption of ASU
2017-01 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize
the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most
existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect
transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective
Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, while earlier application is
permitted only for annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2016. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), that clarifies how to apply
revenue recognition guidance related to whether an entity is a principal or an agent. The update clarifies that an entity is a principal when it controls the
specified good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer, and is an agent when it does not control the specified good or service
before it is transferred to the customer. The effective date and transition of ASU 2016-08 is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU
2014-09. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, which provides additional
clarification and improvements for the following areas: loan guarantee fees, contract costs-impairment testing, provision for losses on construction-type
and production-type contracts, cost capitalization guidance, and disclosure requirements. The effective date and transition of ASU 2016-20 is the same
as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09. The Company has established a team which continues to evaluate and document the possible
impacts of the standard, including potential changes to the accounting for investment management services performed, and also consider any reporting,
tax and operational implications. The Company has not yet finalized its transition method, but does not expect, under either method, the provisions of
ASU 2014-09 to result in any material changes to the timing of when revenue is recognized. The Company plans to adopt this standard effective
January 1, 2018.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities (Topic 825-10). ASU 2016-01 amends existing guidance related to the accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities. These
amendments, among other things, require equity

investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at
fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value
of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and
form of financial asset and eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate
the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual periods and
interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have on results from operations and financial position.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 amends existing guidance related to the accounting for
leases. These amendments, among other things, require lessees to account for most leases on the balance sheet while recognizing expense on the income
statement in a manner similar to existing guidance. For lessors the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and
direct finance leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2018,
with early adoption permitted. ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method for all entities. The Company has performed a
preliminary analysis of ASU 2016-02. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 is expected to impact the balance sheet of the Company, as both the value of the
leased office space as well as the current value of future lease liabilities will be recorded, however the evaluation has not yet been completed. The
Company plans to adopt this standard effective January 1, 2019.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326). ASU 2016-13 sets forth a “current expected credit
loss” (CECL) model which requires the Company to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on
historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the
measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit exposures. ASU 2016-13
requires enhanced disclosures, including qualitative and quantitative requirements, to help understand significant estimates and judgments used in
estimating credit losses, as well as provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. ASU 2016-13 is effective for
annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted after annual and
interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 31, 2018. ASU 2016-13 mandates a modified retrospective transition method for
all entities. The Company is currently in the scoping and evaluating phase of the adoption of ASU 2016-13.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the classification of
certain cash receipts and cash payments for presentation in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods and interim periods
within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the
adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on results from operations or financial position.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810), Interest Held Through Related Parties That Are Under Common
Control. ASU 2016-17 changes the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by changing how a reporting entity that
is a single decision maker of a VIE treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting
entity. ASU 2016-17 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, with early
adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-17 on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. ASU 2016-18 requires that the

15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. However, adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim
period. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-18 to have a material impact on its financial statements and expects the impact to be
disclosure only.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
ASU 2017-04 simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04 an
entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, and
should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value with the loss not exceeding
the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting
period beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2017-04 on
our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Receivables—Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Topic 310): Premium Amortization on
Purchased Callable Debt Securities. ASU 2017-08 amends the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium,
shortening such period to the earliest call date. ASU 2017-08 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within that reporting period beginning
after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2017-08 will be adopted using a modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative
effect adjustment recognized to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Entities are also required to provide disclosures about a
change in accounting principle in the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2017-08 on our consolidated
financial statements.

Note 3. Acquisition and Disposition Activities

Acquisition of Fifth Street CLO Management LLC

On July 20, 2017, the Company acquired 100% of the limited liability company interests of Fifth Street CLO Management LLC (“FSCM”), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Fifth Street Holdings L.P. The purchase included contracts to manage two off balance sheet middle market CLOs and
certain interests in the CLOs which will be held on the balance sheet of NewStar after the acquisition to comply with risk retention requirements. FSCM
was subsequently rebranded and now operates as NewStar Commercial Loan Originator II LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The
Company evaluated the transaction under ASU 2017-01 and concluded that it does not meet the definition of a business and therefore is treated as an
asset acquisition.

The purchase price was $16.6 million, net of $13.1 million of assumed indebtedness. The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the
acquisition were recorded by the company at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.

Fair values of the major categories of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined as follows:

The fair value of investments in available for sale securities was determined based upon the value of notes of the CLO’s determined through a
third party appraisal. The majority of these notes were retained for European Union (“EU”) risk retention rules.

The fair value of the customer contracts and related customer relationships included in identified intangible assets above, was determined using
the excess earnings method under the income approach per ASC 820. Management projected net cash flows of each investment / collateral management
agreement acquired to estimate the useful life of the respective contracts. These net after-tax cash flows were discounted to present value as of the
acquisition date. The fair value of customer contracts and related customer relationships was estimated at $5.4 million. The intangible assets are being
amortized over their expected economic useful life, which we estimate at 3.5 years.

The fair value of other assets included accrued management fees, prepaid expenses and miscellaneous receivables which the Company believes
approximated carrying value.

The fair value of the accrued expenses approximated the carrying value of these accounts.

The fair value of the term debt was recorded at the outstanding amount due to the third party as of the acquisition date which the Company
believes approximated carrying value.

Sale of NewStar Equipment Finance assets and related platform

On December 1, 2016, the Company sold the assets of NewStar Equipment Finance (“Equipment Finance”) and related platform to a third party
and exited the business. The sale of Equipment Finance assets was the result of the Company’s decision to exit businesses with economic models
increasingly challenged by competition from banks and other lenders with access to lower cost funding. The sale resulted in a gain of $6.7 million,
before transaction related costs of $4.3 million. The net gain was recorded in non-interest income on the consolidated statement of operations. In
connection with the sale of the assets of Equipment Finance, the Company established a $1.4 million contingent liability to cover any potential credit
indemnification costs resulting from actual credit losses incurred on the assets sold. As of September 30, 2017, this amount was reduced to $1.0 million.
This liability reflects management’s best estimate of losses, taking into consideration the individual credit quality and borrower activity since origination
and the anticipated residual value of the assets sold. As of September 30,

Table of Contents

The Company provides commercial loans to customers throughout the United States. The Company’s borrowers may be susceptible to economic
slowdowns or recessions and, as a result, may have a lower capacity to make scheduled payments of interest or principal on their borrowings during
these periods. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, certain events may occur, including, but not limited to, adverse economic
conditions and adverse events affecting specific clients, industries or markets, that could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to make timely
scheduled principal and interest payments on their loans.

The Company internally risk rates loans based on individual credit criteria on at least a quarterly basis. Borrowers provide the Company with
financial information on either a quarterly or monthly basis. Loan ratings as well as identification of impaired loans are dynamically updated to reflect
changes in borrower condition or profile. A loan is considered to be impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts
due to it according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans include all non-accrual loans, loans with partial charge-offs and loans
which are troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”).

The Company utilizes a number of analytical tools for the purpose of estimating probability of default and loss given default for its lending
groups. The quantitative models employed by the Company in its Leveraged Finance business utilize Moody’s KMV RiskCalc credit risk model in
combination with a proprietary qualitative model, which generates a rating that maps to a probability of default estimate. For real estate loans, the
Company utilizes a proprietary model that has been developed to capture risk characteristics unique to the lending activities in that line of business.
Together, these models produce a suggested obligor risk rating which corresponds to a probability of default and also produces a loss given default. In
each case, the probability of default and the loss given default are used to calculate an expected loss for those lending groups. Prior to the sale of the
Equipment Finance assets, management used similar models for its Equipment Finance portfolio as its Leveraged Finance group. Prior to the sale of
Business Credit, management utilized a proprietary model that produced a rating that corresponded to an expected loss, for the Business Credit portfolio.

Loans which are rated at or better than a specified threshold are typically classified as “Pass”, and loans rated worse than that threshold are
typically classified as “Criticized”, a characterization that may apply to impaired loans, including TDR. As of September 30, 2017, $106.8 million of the
Company’s loans were classified as “Criticized,” all of which were impaired loans, and $3.0 billion were classified as “Pass”. As of December 31, 2016,
$118.7 million of the Company’s loans were classified as “Criticized” all of which were impaired loans, and $3.2 billion were classified as “Pass”.

When the Company determines a loan is impaired, the Company will evaluate the loan individually and, if necessary, establish a specific
allowance. The loan will be analyzed and may be placed on non-accrual status. If the asset deteriorates further, the specific allowance may increase, and
ultimately may result in a loss and charge-off.

A TDR that performs in accordance with the terms of its restructuring may improve its risk profile over time. While the concessions in terms of
pricing or amortization may not have been reversed and further amended to “market” levels, the financial condition of the borrower may improve over
time to the point where the rating improves from the “Criticized” classification that was appropriate immediately prior to, or at, restructuring.

A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the
loan agreement. The measurement of impairment of a loan is based upon (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s
effective interest rate, (ii) the loan’s observable market price, or (iii) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, depending on the
circumstances and our collection strategy. Impaired loans are identified based on the loan-by-loan risk rating process described above. It is the
Company’s policy during the reporting period to record a specific provision for credit losses and/or partial or full charge off for all loans for which we
have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms.

As of September 30, 2017, the Company had investments, net of charge-offs in impaired loans with a balance of $153.7 million. Impaired loans
with an aggregate outstanding balance of $85.1 million have been restructured and classified as TDRs. At September 30, 2017, additional funding
commitments for TDRs totaled $4.1 million. As of September 30, 2017, the aggregate carrying value of equity investments in certain of the Company’s
borrowers in connection with troubled debt restructurings totaled $10.9 million. Impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $103.8 million
were also on non-accrual status. These non-accrual loans had a carrying value of $97.4 million before specific reserves. For impaired loans on
non-accrual status, the Company’s policy is to reverse the accrued interest previously recognized as interest income subsequent to the last cash receipt in
the current year. The recognition of interest income on the loan only resumes when factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist and the
non-accrual loan payment status has been brought current. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company charged off
$8.6 million and $21.5 million, respectively of non-accruing loan balances. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, the Company placed
one new relationship on non-accrual status with an aggregate outstanding balance of $26.9 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017,
the Company placed loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $35.5 million on non-accrual status. During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2017, the Company recorded $3.9 million and $13.4 million, respectively, of net specific provisions for impaired loans. At September 30,
2017, the Company had a $11.7 million specific allowance for impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $100.1 million. At
September 30, 2017, additional funding commitments for impaired loans totaled $14.1 million. The Company’s obligation to fulfill the additional
funding commitments on impaired loans is generally contingent on the borrower’s compliance with the terms of the credit agreement. If the borrower is
not in compliance additional funding commitments may be made at the Company’s discretion. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had loans
totaling $36.7 million which were greater than 60 days past due and classified as delinquent of which $4.0 million were on non-accrual status. Included
in the $11.7 million specific allowance for impaired loans was $5.1 million related to delinquent loans.

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had investments, net of charge offs in impaired loans with a balance of $133.4 million. At that date,
impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $114.8 million had been restructured and classified as TDR. As of December 31, 2016, the
aggregate carrying value of equity investments in certain of the Company’s borrowers in connection with troubled debt restructurings totaled
$9.9 million. Impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $99.2 million were also on non-accrual status. These non-accrual loans had a
carrying value of $92.9 million before specific reserves. During 2016, the Company charged off $25.7 million of outstanding non-accrual loans. During
2016, the Company placed loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $27.1 million on non-accrual status and no loans were returned to performing
status. During 2016, the Company recorded $24.8 million of net specific provisions for impaired loans. At December 31, 2016, the Company had a
$19.8 million specific allowance for impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $73.5 million. At December 31, 2016, additional funding
commitments for impaired loans totaled $11.9 million. As of December 31, 2016, loans to two borrowers totaling approximately $21.1 million were on
non-accrual status and were greater than 60 days past due and classified as delinquent by the Company. Included in the $19.8 million specific allowance
for impaired loans was $7.9 million related to delinquent loans.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company recorded net partial charge-offs of $8.6 million and $21.5 million,
respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a net recovery of $0.05 million on loans previously
charged-off, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $14.2 million.

When a loan is determined to be uncollectible, the specific allowance is charged off, which reduces the gross investment in the loan. The
Company may record the initial specific allowance related to an impaired loan in the same period as it records a partial charge-off in certain
circumstances such as if the terms of a restructured loan are finalized during that period.

While charge-offs typically have no net impact on the carrying value of net loans, charge-offs lower the level of the allowance for loan losses, and,
as a result, reduce the percentage of allowance for loans to total loans, and the percentage of allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans.

Loans being restructured have typically developed adverse performance trends as a result of various factors, the result of which is an inability to
comply with the terms of the applicable credit agreement governing the borrowers’ obligations to the Company. In order to mitigate default risk and/or
liquidation, assuming that liquidation proceeds are not viewed as a more favorable outcome to the Company and other lenders, the Company will enter
into negotiations with the borrower and its shareholders on the terms of a restructuring. When restructuring a loan, the Company undertakes an extensive
diligence process which typically includes (i) development of a financial model with a forecast horizon that matches the term of the proposed
restructuring, (ii) meetings with management of the borrower, (iii) engagement of third party consultants and (iv) other internal analyses. Once a
restructuring proposal is developed, it is subject to approval by both the Company’s Underwriting and Investment Committee. Loans are only removed
from TDR classification after a period of performance following the refinancing of outstanding obligations on terms which are determined to be
“market” in all material respects. The Company may modify loans that are not determined to be a TDR. Where a loan is modified or restructured but
loan terms are considered market and no concessions were given on the loan terms, including price, principal amortization or obligation, or other
restrictive covenants, a loan will not be classified as a TDR.

The Company has made the following types of concessions in the context of a TDR:

Group I:
 

 •  extension of principal repayment term
 

 •  principal holidays
 

 •  interest rate adjustments

Group II:
 

 •  partial forgiveness
 

 •  conversion of debt to equity

A summary of the types of concessions that the Company made with respect to TDRs at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is provided
below:

Note: A loan may be included in both restructuring groups, but not repeated within each group.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company recorded $8.6 million and $21.6 million, respectively, of partial charge-
offs related to loans previously classified as TDR. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had not removed the TDR classification from any loan
previously identified as such during the quarter, but had charged-off, sold and received repayments of outstanding TDRs.

The Company measures TDRs similarly to how it measures all loans for impairment. The Company performs a discounted cash flow analysis on
cash flow dependent loans and assesses the underlying collateral value less reasonable costs of sale for collateral dependent loans. Management analyzes
the projected performance of the borrower to determine if it has the ability to service principal and interest payments based on the terms of the
restructuring. Loans will typically not be returned to accrual status until at least six months of contractual payments have been made in a timely manner
or the borrower shows significant ability to maintain servicing of the restructured debt. Additionally, at the time of a restructuring and quarterly
thereafter, an impairment analysis is undertaken to determine the measurement of specific reserve, if any, on each impaired loan.

Below is a summary of the Company’s loans which were newly classified as TDR and existing TDR loans which subsequently defaulted, in each
during the periods presented.

A general allowance is provided for loans within the amortized portfolio that are not impaired. The Company employs a variety of internally
developed and third-party modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk, which are used in developing an allowance for loan losses on
outstanding loans held at amortized cost. The Company’s allowance framework addresses economic conditions, capital market liquidity and industry
circumstances from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective. The Company considers and evaluates a number of factors, including but not limited to,
changes in economic conditions, credit availability, industry, loss emergence period, and multiple obligor concentrations in assessing both probabilities
of default and loss severities as part of the general component of the allowance for loan losses. The Company continually evaluates the appropriateness
of its allowance for credit losses methodology. Based on the Company’s evaluation process to determine the level of the allowance for loan losses,
management believes the allowance to be adequate as of September 30, 2017 in light of the estimated known and inherent risks identified through its
analysis.

The Company closely monitors the credit quality of its loans which is partly reflected in its credit metrics such as loan delinquencies, non-accruals
and charge-offs. Changes in these credit metrics are largely due to changes in economic conditions and seasoning of the loan portfolio.

Table of Contents

On at least a quarterly basis, loans are internally risk-rated based on individual credit criteria, including loan type, loan structures (including
balloon and bullet structures common in the Company’s Leveraged Finance and Real Estate cash flow loans), borrower industry, payment capacity,
location and quality of collateral if any (including the Company’s Real Estate loans). Borrowers provide the Company with financial information on
either a monthly or quarterly basis. Ratings, corresponding assumed default rates and assumed loss severities are dynamically updated to reflect any
changes in borrower condition and/or profile.

For Leveraged Finance loans and Equipment Finance loans and leases (prior to the sale of the latter), the data set used to construct probabilities of
default in its allowance for loan losses model, Moody’s CRD Private Firm Database, primarily contains middle market loans that share attributes similar
to the Company’s loans. The Company also considers the quality of the loan terms and lender protections in determining a loan loss in the event of
default.

For Real Estate loans, the Company employs two mechanisms to capture the impact of industry and economic conditions. First, a loan’s risk
rating, and thereby its assumed default likelihood, can be adjusted to account for overall commercial real estate market conditions. Second, to the extent
that economic or industry trends adversely affect a substandard rated borrower’s loan-to-value ratio enough to impact its repayment ability, the
Company applies a stress multiplier to the loan’s probability of default. The multiplier is designed to account for default characteristics that are difficult
to quantify when market conditions cause commercial real estate prices to decline.

Prior to the sale of Business Credit, the Company utilized a proprietary model to risk rate the loans on a monthly basis. This model captured the
impact of changes in industry and economic conditions as well as changes in the quality of the borrower’s collateral and financial performance to assign
a final risk rating. The Company also evaluated historical net loss trends by risk rating from a comprehensive industry database covering more than
twenty-five years of experience of the majority of the asset based lenders operating in the United States. Based upon the monthly risk rating from the
model, the reserve was adjusted to reflect the historical average for expected loss from the industry database.

The Company periodically reviews its allowance for credit loss methodology to assess any necessary adjustments based upon changing economic
and capital market conditions. If the Company determines that changes in its allowance for credit losses methodology are advisable, as a result of
changes in the economic environment or otherwise, the revised allowance methodology may result in higher or lower levels of allowance.

Additionally, when determining the amount of the general allowance, the Company supplements the base amount with an environmental reserve
amount which is governed by a score card system comprised of seven risk factors. The risk factors are designed based on those outlined in the
Comptrollers of the Currency’s Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Handbook. The Company also performs a ratio analysis of comparable money
center banks, regional banks and finance companies. While the Company does not rely on this peer group comparison to set the level of allowance for
credit losses, use of the peer group does assist management in identifying market trends and serves as an overall reasonableness check on the allowance
for credit losses computation.

Included in the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is an allowance for unfunded commitments of
$0.5 million, which is recorded as a component of other liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet with changes recorded in the provision
for credit losses on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The methodology for determining the allowance for unfunded commitments is
consistent with the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company recorded a total provision for credit losses of $10.3 million. The Company
decreased its allowance for credit losses to $40.2 million as of September 30, 2017 from $51.4 million at December 31, 2016. The general allowance for
credit losses covers probable incurred losses in the Company’s loan portfolio with respect to loans for which no specific impairment has been

identified. When a loan is classified as impaired, the loan is evaluated for a specific allowance and a specific provision may be recorded, thereby
removing it from consideration under the general component of the allowance analysis. Loans that are deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and
deducted from the allowance, and recoveries on loans previously charged off are netted against loans charged off. A specific provision for credit losses
is recorded with respect to impaired loans for which it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the
contractual terms of the loan agreement for which there is impairment recognized. The outstanding balance of impaired loans, which include all of the
outstanding balances of the Company’s delinquent loans and its troubled debt restructurings, as a percentage of “Loans, net” was 5% and 4% as of
September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

At September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 investments in non-NewStar managed issuers totaled $74.0 million and $75.8 million,
respectively. NewStar managed issuers are off balance sheet credit funds in which NewStar holds 5% of each class of notes of a securitization to comply
with European Union (“EU”) risk retention rules. These managed issuers are considered unconsolidated VIEs and are discussed in Note 11.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company purchased $23.1 million and $52.7 million of debt securities,
$21.5 million were purchased to satisfy EU risk retention rules, redeemed a $5.9 million par value investment in debt securities, and made a $0.5 million
par paydown. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not purchase or sell any debt securities available for sale and a
$6.0 million investment in debt securities was redeemed at par.

The Company did not record any net “Other-Than-Temporary Impairment” charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017.

The following is an analysis of the continuous periods during which the Company has held investment positions which were carried at an
unrealized loss as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016:

As a result of the Company’s evaluation of the securities, management concluded that the unrealized losses at September 30, 2017 and
December 31, 2016 were caused by changes in market prices driven by interest rates and credit spreads. The Company’s evaluation of impairment
include quotes from third party pricing services, adjustments to prepayment speeds, delinquency, an analysis of expected cash flows, interest rates,
market discount rates, other contract terms, and the timing and level of losses on the loans and leases within the underlying trusts. At September 30,
2017, the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the securities before the Company recovers its
amortized cost basis in the security. The Company has also determined that there has not been an adverse change in the cash flows expected to be
collected. Based upon the Company’s impairment review process, and the Company’s ability and intent to hold these securities until maturity or a
recovery of fair value, the decline in the value of these investments is not considered to be “Other Than Temporary.”

Actual maturities of debt securities may differ from those presented above since certain obligations amortize and provide the issuer of the
individual debt securities the right to call or prepay the obligation prior to the scheduled final stated maturity without penalty.

Note 7. Borrowings

Credit Facilities

As of September 30, 2017 the Company had two credit facilities through certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries: (i) a $615.0 million credit
facility with syndicated lenders agented by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) to fund leveraged finance loans, and (ii) a
$250.0 million credit facility with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) to fund leveraged finance loans.

The Company must comply with various covenants under these facilities. The breach of certain of these covenants could result in a termination
event and the exercise of remedies if not cured. At September 30, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. These covenants are
customary and include, but are not limited to, failure to service debt obligations, failure to meet liquidity covenants and tangible net worth covenants,
and failure to remain within prescribed facility portfolio delinquency, charge-off levels, and overcollateralization tests.

The Company’s $615.0 million credit facility with syndicated lenders agented by Wells Fargo to fund leveraged finance loans had an outstanding
balance of $368.9 million and unamortized deferred financing fees of $5.0 million as of September 30, 2017. Interest on this facility accrues at a
variable rate per annum. The facility matures on August 10, 2020. The facility provides for a revolving reinvestment period which ends on August 10,
2018, with a two-year amortization period.

The Company’s $250.0 million credit facility with Citibank to fund leveraged finance loans had a $95.0 million outstanding balance and
unamortized deferred financing fees of $1.9 million as of September 30, 2017. Interest on this facility accrues at a variable rate per annum. The facility
matures on May 5, 2020. It provides for a revolving reinvestment period which ends on May 5, 2018, with a two-year amortization period.

Senior notes

On April 22, 2015, the Company issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). On
November 9, 2015, the Company issued an additional $80.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes, at a debt discount of $0.8 million
which will amortize over the life of the 2020 Notes. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the April notes offering to repay in full its
corporate credit facility with Fortress Credit Corp. The 2020 Notes mature on May 1, 2020, and bear interest at a

rate of 7.25% per annum, which is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. On or after May 1, 2017, the Company may redeem
the 2020 Notes, in whole or in part, at redemption prices specified in the 2020 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In addition, if the
Company undergoes a change of control, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 2020 Notes at a price equal to 101%
of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of September 30, 2017, unamortized deferred financing fees were
$4.3 million.

Subordinated notes

On December 4, 2014, the Company completed the initial closing of an investment of long-term capital from funds sponsored by Franklin Square
Capital Partners (“Franklin Square”) and sub-advised by GSO Capital Partners at which the Franklin Square funds purchased $200.0 million of 10-year
subordinated notes (the “Subordinated Notes”), which rank junior to the Company’s existing and future senior debt. During 2015, the Company drew an
additional $75 million of these Subordinated Notes. The Company drew the remaining $25 million in January 2016. The Subordinated Notes were
recorded at par less the initial relative fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the investment in December 2014 and January 2015, which
was $48.6 million as of September 30, 2017 and $53.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The debt discount will amortize over the life of the notes and
will be recorded as non-cash interest expense as the Subordinated Notes accrete to par value. As of September 30, 2017, unamortized deferred financing
fees were $4.4 million. The Subordinated Notes bear interest at 8.25% and include a Payment-in-Kind (“PIK Toggle”) feature that allows the Company,
at its option, to elect to have interest accrued at a rate of 8.75% added to the principal of the Subordinated Notes instead of paying it in cash. The
Subordinated Notes have a ten-year term and mature on December 4, 2024. They are callable during the first three years with payment of a make-whole
premium. The prepayment premium decreases to 103% and 101% after the third and fourth anniversaries of the closing, respectively. They are callable
at par after December 4, 2019. Beginning on December 5, 2019, the Company is required to make a cash payment of principal plus accrued interest in
an amount required to prevent the Subordinated Notes from being treated as an “Applicable High Yield Discount Obligation” within the meaning of
Section 163(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Events of default under the Subordinated Notes include failure to pay interest or
principal when due subject to applicable grace periods, material uncured breaches of the terms of the Subordinated Notes, and bankruptcy/insolvency
events.

Term Debt

On July 20, 2017, in connection with the acquisition of FSCM, the Company assumed the indebtedness associated with the Natixis credit
agreement dated September 28, 2015. The proceeds under this credit agreement were used solely to purchase the interests held in a FSCM-managed
CLO to comply with risk retention requirements. The credit agreement matures on September 29, 2027.

Term Debt Securitizations

2012-2 CLO. On December 18, 2012, the Company completed a term debt securitization transaction. In conjunction with this transaction the
Company established a separate single-purpose bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, NewStar Commercial Loan Funding 2012-2 LLC (the “2012-2 CLO”)
and sold and contributed $325.9 million in loans and investments (including unfunded commitments), or portions thereof, to the 2012-2 CLO. The
Company remains the servicer of the loans. Simultaneously with the initial sale and contribution, the 2012-2 CLO issued $263.3 million of notes to
institutional investors. The Company retained $62.6 million, comprising 100% of the 2012-2 CLO’s membership interests, Class E notes, Class F notes,
and subordinated notes. On June 12, 2015, the Company sold 100% of the 2012-2 CLO’s Class E Notes totaling $16.3 million to institutional investors.
At September 30, 2017, the $142.3 million of outstanding drawn notes were collateralized by the specific loans and investments, principal collection
account cash and principal payment receivables totaling $188.6 million. At September 30, 2017, unamortized deferred financing fees were $0.2 million.
The 2012-2 CLO permitted reinvestment of collateral principal repayments for a three-year period which ended in January 2016.

The Company receives a loan collateral management fee and excess interest spread. The Company also receives payments with respect to the
classes of notes it owns in accordance with the transaction documents. The Company expects to receive a principal distribution as owner of the
membership interests when the term debt is retired. If loan collateral in the 2012-2 CLO is in default under the terms of the indenture, the excess interest
spread from the 2012-2 CLO may not be distributed if the overcollateralization ratio, or other collateral quality tests, are not satisfied.

investments (including unfunded commitments), or portions thereof, to the 2014-1 CLO. The Company remains the servicer of the loans.
Simultaneously with the initial sale and contribution, the 2014-1 CLO issued $289.5 million of notes to institutional investors. The Company retained
$58.9 million, comprising 100% of the 2014-1 CLO’s membership interests, Class E notes, Class F notes, and subordinated notes. At September 30,
2017, the $289.5 million of outstanding drawn notes were collateralized by the specific loans and investments, principal collection account cash and
principal payment receivables totaling $348.4 million. At September 30, 2017, unamortized deferred financing fees were $1.5 million. The 2014-1 CLO
permits reinvestment of collateral principal repayments for a four-year period ending in April 2018. Should the Company determine that reinvestment of
collateral principal repayments are impractical in light of market conditions or if collateral principal repayments are not reinvested within a prescribed
timeframe, such funds may be used to repay the outstanding notes. Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Company has the right to redeem the
2014-1 CLO following the expiration of the non-call period which occurred on the payment date in April 2016.

2015-1 CLO. On March 20, 2015, the Company completed a term debt securitization transaction through its separate single-purpose bankruptcy-
remote subsidiary, NewStar Commercial Loan Funding 2015-1 LLC (the “2015-1 CLO”) and sold and contributed $336.3 million in loans and
investments (including unfunded commitments), or portions thereof, to the 2015-1 CLO. The Company remains the servicer of the loans.
Simultaneously with the initial sale and contribution, the 2015-1 CLO issued $410.3 million of notes to institutional investors. The Company retained
$85.8 million, comprising 100% of the 2015-1 CLO’s membership interests and subordinated notes. At September 30, 2017, the $410.3 million of
outstanding drawn notes were collateralized by the specific loans and investments, principal collection account cash and principal payment receivables
totaling $496.1 million. At September 30, 2017, unamortized deferred financing fees were $2.6 million. The 2015-1 CLO permits reinvestment of
collateral principal repayments for a four-year period ending in April 2019. Should the Company determine that reinvestment of collateral principal
repayments are impractical in light of market conditions or if collateral principal repayments are not reinvested within a prescribed timeframe, such
funds may be used to repay the outstanding notes. Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Company has the right to redeem the 2015-1 CLO following
the expiration of the non-call period which occurred on the payment date in April 2017.

The Company receives a loan collateral management fee and excess interest spread. The Company also receives payments with respect to the
classes of notes it owns in accordance with the transaction documents. The Company expects to receive a principal distribution as owner of the
membership interests when the term debt is retired. If loan collateral in the 2015-1 CLO is in default under the terms of the indenture, the excess interest
spread from the 2015-1 CLO may not be distributed if the overcollateralization ratio, or other collateral quality tests, are not satisfied.

Warrants

On January 23, 2015, the Company completed its December 4, 2014 issuance of warrants as part of the strategic relationship with Franklin Square
Capital Partners (“Franklin Square”). The Company issued the second tranche of warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of its common stock subject to
the same terms as the warrants that were issued on December 4, 2014, bringing the total warrants to purchase shares of common stock to 12,000,000.

The terms of the warrants contain standard adjustments to the exercise price and warrant shares to adjust for the effect of certain distributions,
including cash dividends. No adjustments are required until cumulative adjustments would result in a one percent change to the exercise price or number
of warrant shares. To date, the cash dividends declared and paid by the Company have not resulted in any adjustment to the warrants’ exercise price or
the number of shares underlying the warrants, because such distributions have not exceeded the minimum adjustment amounts.

Restricted Stock

pursuant to the Company’s 2006 Incentive Plan, as amended and 56,698 shares of restricted stock to certain members of its Board of Directors. The fair
value of the shares of restricted stock is equal to the closing price of the Company’s stock on the date of issuance. The shares of restricted stock issued to
employees of the Company vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant.

Stock Options

Under the Company’s 2006 Incentive Plan, the Company’s compensation committee may grant options to purchase shares of common stock.
Stock options may either be incentive stock options (“ISOs”) or non-qualified stock options. ISOs may only be granted to officers and employees. The
compensation committee will, with regard to each stock option, determine the number of shares subject to the stock option, the manner and time of
exercise, vesting, and the exercise price, which will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. The
shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of options or other awards or upon grant of any other award may be either previously authorized but

Note 10. Earnings Per Share

The Company utilizes the two-class method to calculate earnings per share. The two-class method allocates net income to each class of common
stock and participating security. Unvested share-based payment awards granted to certain employees and board members entitle holders to same rights
as outstanding and vested common stock. These securities are considered to be participating securities and are included in the allocation for computing
earnings per share under this method. Income is allocated to common shareholders and participating securities under the two-class method based upon
the proportion of each to the total weighted average shares available.

The computations of basic and diluted income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

Note 11. Variable Interest Entities

The Company sponsors the formation of various entities that are considered to be VIEs. The majority of these VIEs were formed to issue term
debt securitizations. The assets of the VIEs are primarily comprised of senior secured loans and the liabilities are primarily comprised of debt. The
Company’s determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE is based in part on an assessment of whether or not the Company is
exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards of the entity. In instances where the Company retains a significant portion of the equity and remains the
servicer of the loans, it was determined that the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance
of these VIEs. Additionally, the Company determined that the potential fees that we could receive directly or indirectly from these VIEs represent rights
to returns that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. As a result, the Company was deemed the primary beneficiary and therefore has consolidated
these entities. Liabilities of the consolidated VIEs are disclosed in Note 7.

Unconsolidated VIEs

In July 2017, NewStar acquired Fifth Street CLO Management LLC, which was rebranded and now operates as NewStar Commercial Loan
Originator II LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase included contracts to manage two off balance sheet middle market CLOs,
which have been renamed NewStar Exeter Fund CLO LLC (“Exeter Fund”) and NewStar Fairfield Fund CLO LTD (“Fairfield Fund”). The Company
holds $3.9 million of Class F and subordinated notes of Exeter Fund and $21.5 million (vertical strip) of the notes of Fairfield Fund. Interests in the
Fairfield Fund were retained to satisfy EU risk retention rules. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the either the Exeter
Fund or Fairfield Fund and will not consolidate the operating results or statements of financial position; however, the Company has determined that it
has a variable interest in the both the Exeter Fund and Fairfield Fund as it holds notes of the securitization.

On April 18, 2017, NewStar refinanced its managed credit fund, Longfellow Place CLO, Ltd. (the “Longfellow Fund”), under a $516.9 million
term debt securitization. The Longfellow Fund is a credit fund established in February 2013 to finance the purchase of a broadly syndicated bank loan
portfolio through the issuance of debt and equity. To comply with EU risk retention rules, the Company holds 5% of each class of notes in the
securitization (vertical strip), totaling $27.5 million. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the Longfellow Fund and will
not consolidate the Longfellow Fund’s operating results or statements of financial position; however, the Company has determined that it has a variable
interest in the Longfellow Fund as it holds notes of the securitization.

In November 2016, NewStar closed a new managed credit fund, NewStar Berkeley Fund CLO LLC (the “Berkeley Fund”), a $505.0 million term
debt securitization. The Berkeley Fund is the fourth credit fund established by the Company to co-invest in directly originated middle market
commercial loans. To comply with EU risk retention rules, the Company holds 5% of each class of notes in the securitization (vertical strip), totaling
$25.3 million. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the Berkeley Fund and will not consolidate the Berkeley Fund’s
operating results or statements of financial position; however, the Company has determined that it has a variable interest in the Berkeley Fund as it holds
notes of the securitization.

In January 2015, NewStar closed a new managed credit fund, NewStar Clarendon Fund CLO LLC (the “Clarendon Fund”), a $400.0 million term
debt securitization. The Clarendon Fund is the third credit fund established by the Company to co-invest in directly originated middle market
commercial loans. To comply with EU risk retention rules, the Company holds 5% of each class of notes in the securitization (vertical strip), totaling
$20.4 million. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the Clarendon Fund and will not consolidate the Clarendon Fund’s
operating results or statements of financial position; however, the Company has determined that it has a variable interest in the Clarendon Fund as it
holds notes of the securitization.

In October 2015, NewStar acquired FOC Partners, which now operates as NewStar Capital. At acquisition, NewStar Capital was the investment
manager for six collateralized loan obligations and two sponsored funds and provided discretionary services to a series of separately managed accounts.
The Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of any of acquired CLOs, sponsored funds or separately managed accounts; however,
the Company determined that it had a variable interest in the Secured Value sponsored fund as it holds approximately one percent of the interest of the
fund. The Secured Value sponsored fund was liquated on September 29, 2017.

The following table sets forth the information with respect to the unconsolidated VIEs for which the Company holds a variable interest in as of
September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016:

Note 12. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk

The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its
borrowers. These financial instruments include unfunded commitments and standby letters of credit. The instruments involve, to varying degrees,
elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments
reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.

The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for standby letters of credit is
represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional
obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.

Unused lines of credit are commitments to lend to a borrower if certain conditions have been met. These commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Because certain commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the
total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each borrower’s creditworthiness on a
case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral required is based on factors that include management’s credit evaluation of the borrower and the borrower’s
compliance with financial covenants. Due to their fluctuating nature, the Company cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts that will be
required to fund its unfunded commitments. The aggregate amount of these unfunded commitments may exceed the Company’s available funds.

The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending credit to our borrowers. Standby letters of
credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance by a borrower to a third party.

Note 13. Total Return Swap

The Company was a participant in a Total Return Swap (“TRS”), which matured on March 31, 2016. We acted as the manager of the TRS and
selected the specific loans to be subject to the TRS. The TRS did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as it did not offset the risks of another
investment position.

The underlying referenced loan portfolio of the TRS was primarily large, liquid, broadly syndicated senior secure floating rate loans with
Citibank, N.A. as the counterparty. The TRS effectively added leverage to the Company’s portfolio by providing economic benefits of the loans subject
to the TRS, despite the fact that such loans were not directly owned the Company, in return for an interest-type payment to Citibank.

On December 4, 2014, NewStar TRS I LLC, a newly-formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into the TRS. The initial
maximum market value (determined at the time such loan becomes subject to the TRS) of the portfolio of loans subject to the TRS was $75.0 million.
On December 15, 2014, we entered into an amendment to the TRS that increased the maximum value to $125.0 million, on March 2, 2015, we entered
into an amendment that increased the maximum value to $150.0 million, and on July 14, 2015, we entered into an additional amendment to the TRS that
increased the maximum value to $175.0 million.

Upon maturity of the TRS on March 31, 2016, the Company purchased $138.9 million of the loans in the referenced portfolio. The majority of
these loans were purchased to fund future CLOs of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary NewStar Capital. The Company recorded these loans
at fair value which was determined by using the midpoint of the bid-ask spread provided by an independent third-party pricing service.

At March 31, 2016, the receivable and realized loss on the total return swap on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of
operations consisted of the following:
 

   Net Receivable   
Net Realized

Gains/(Losses) 
   ($ in thousands)  
Interest income from TRS portfolio   $ —     $ 2,355 
TRS interest expense    —      848 
Realized loss on TRS    —      (6,122) 
Due to Citibank    (10,984)    —   
TRS receivable    1,145    —   

The fair value of the TRS was reflected as an unrealized gain or loss on the total return swap on the consolidated balance sheet, within other assets
or liabilities. The change in value of the TRS was reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as loss on total return swap.

The Company’s obligations under the TRS were non-recourse to it, and its exposure was limited to the value of the cash collateral which
fluctuated from time to time depending on the market value of the underlying loans. The Company was required to cash collateralize a specified
percentage of each loan included under the TRS in accordance with margin requirements. As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the
Company had no cash collateral on deposit with Citibank.

Table of Contents

The Company paid interest to Citibank for each loan at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.60% per annum. Upon the termination or
repayment of any loan under the TRS Agreement, the Company would deduct the appreciation of such loan’s value from any interest owed to Citibank
or pay the depreciation amount to Citibank in addition to remaining interest payments.

Note 14. Fair Value

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and disclosures (“ASC 820”) establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value
measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The
three levels are defined as follows:
 

 •  Level 1—inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
 

 
•  Level 2—inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are

observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
 

 •  Level 3—inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.

Items Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Investments in debt securities, available-for-sale

Investments in debt securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value measurement of investments in debt
securities is based on third party pricing services or by using internally developed financial models. For securities in less liquid markets where there is
limited activity and little transparency around broker quotes used to value such securities, the Company classifies securities valued using broker quotes
as Level 3. If quoted prices are not available, then fair value is estimated by using internally developed financial models. These securities are not
actively traded and require a private sale, and the valuation involves application of significant management judgment. Inputs into the model-based
valuations can include changes in market indexes, selling prices of similar securities, management’s assumptions related to the credit rating of the
security, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions and management’s assessment of the current market conditions. Such
securities are classified as Level 3, as the valuation models are based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market.

Loans

Loans designated to credit funds managed by NewStar Capital are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company has elected to apply
fair value option accounting to these loans which is consistent with the manner in which the credit funds are managed. The fair value of these loans is
based on third party pricing services. These loans are classified as Level 2. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the
Company recorded $0.9 million and $6.8 million, respectively, of losses from the change in fair value.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Collateral dependent impaired loans

Collateral dependent loans that are deemed to be impaired are valued based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral. For collateral
dependent loans for which repayment is dependent on the sale of the

Table of Contents

collateral, management adjusts the fair value for estimated costs to sell. For collateral dependent loans for which repayment is dependent on the
operation of the collateral, management may also adjust values to reflect estimated market value declines or apply other discounts to appraised values.
Collateral dependent impaired loans are categorized as Level 3. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company did not record any
specific allowance for credit losses related to “Collateral dependent impaired loans” measured at fair value. During 2016, the Company recorded
$4.3 million of specific allowance for credit losses related to “Collateral dependent impaired loans” measured at fair value at December 31, 2016, of
which $4.2 million was subsequently charged off when the impaired loans were transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio.

Loans held-for-sale

Loans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Loans held-for-sale measured at fair value consist of loans that have had credit
downgrades and/or have remained in the loans held-for-sale portfolio for a significant period of time. When fair value is determined to be the carrying
value, the fair values of these loans are obtained through a third party pricing service or by using internally developed financial models. Inputs into the
model-based valuations can include changes in market indexes, selling prices of similar loans, management’s assumption related to the credit rating of
the loan, prepayment assumptions and other factors, such as credit loss assumptions. Where quoted market prices are obtained through dealer quotes,
broker indicative prices or online posts, loans held-for-sale are classified as Level 2. Loans held-for-sale are classified as Level 3 in instances where
valuation models are based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market. During the three months and nine months ended September 30,
2017, the Company recorded a loss of $0.5 million and a loss of $0.6 million, respectively, related to “Loans, held-for-sale” measured at fair value.
During 2016, the Company recorded a $2.4 million gain related to “Loans, held-for-sale” measured at fair value.

Other real estate owned or repossessed assets

The fair value is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value, market value of similar properties, liquidation value and
discounted cash flows. Management may adjust the fair value for estimated costs to sell or adjust values to reflect estimated market value declines or
apply other discounts to values. The Company records the other real estate owned and repossessed assets as Level 3. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2017, the Company recorded a $0.1 million expense to write down repossessed assets owned to fair value. During 2016, the Company
recorded a $0.3 million expense to write down other real estate owned to fair value.

unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, Level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the
unobservable or Level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation
methodology. The Company did not transfer any financial instruments in or out of Level 1, 2, or 3 during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2017 and 2016. As of June 30, 2017 it was determined that the contingent liability was no longer measured at fair value.

Valuation of Other Financial Instruments

The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis are
discussed above. The methodologies for other financial instruments are discussed below.

Credit facilities, net: Due to the adjustable rate nature of the borrowings and comparable market spreads, the fair values of the credit facilities are
estimated to approximate their carrying values. Rates currently are comparable to those offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of
comparable maturities by the Company’s lenders.

Term debt, net: The fair value of the term debt is estimated to approximate the carrying value. Rates currently are comparable to those offered to
the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities by the Company’s lenders.

Term debt securitizations, net: The fair value was determined by applying prevailing term debt securitization market interest rates to the
Company’s current term debt securitization structure.

Repurchase agreements, net: The fair value was determined by applying prevailing repurchase agreement market interest rates to the Company’s
current repurchase agreement structure.

Senior notes, net: The fair value was based on available quoted market prices.

Subordinated notes, net: The fair value was estimated as the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at market interest rates on
similar debt instruments, issued by companies with comparable credit ratings.

Other assets/other liabilities: Comprised of non-public investments carried within other assets at $20.4 million and $16.0 million, as of
September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. These investments are in the form of equity or warrants and are obtained as part of the loan
origination process. The investments are initially recorded at cost and reviewed quarterly. If the fair value is less than cost then the investment is written
down to fair value with the necessary adjustment recorded through current earnings. Fair value is determined using internally developed valuation
models. Where sufficient data exists, a market approach method is utilized to estimate the current value of the underlying company. The estimated fair
value of the

underlying securities for warrants requiring valuation at fair value is adjusted for discounts related to lack of liquidity. The Company classifies equity
and warrants as Level 3. The contingent liability for potential indemnification obligations from the sale of Equipment Finance was included in other
liabilities as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Its fair value was based on periodic portfolio review and various assumptions used by
management. The Company classifies the contingent liability as Level 3.

Note 15. Segment Reporting

Beginning in 2016, the Company has two reportable segments, Commercial Lending and Asset Management. Segment information is derived
from the internal reporting system utilized by management. Revenues and expenses for segments reflect those revenue and expenses which can be
specifically identified and have been assigned based on internally developed allocation methods. Results may be restated, when necessary, to reflect
changes in organizational structure or allocation methodology. Any changes in allocations that may affect the reported results of any business segment
will not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company as a whole.

Commercial Lending

The Commercial Lending segment represents our direct lending activities which are focused on providing a range of flexible senior secured debt
options to mid-sized companies with annual cash flow (EBITDA) typically between $15 million and $50 million owned by private equity investment
funds and managed by established professional alternative asset managers. The size of financing commitments depends on various factors, including the
type of loan, the credit characteristics of the borrower, the economic characteristics of the loan, and the Company’s role in the transaction. The Company
may retain these loans on its balance sheet or allocate these loans to off balance sheet managed credit funds managed by the Company or other lenders.
By allocating these loans to the Company’s off balance sheet managed credit funds and other lenders, it is able to provide larger financing commitments
to its customers and generate fee income, while limiting its risk exposure to single borrowers.

Asset Management

The Asset Management segment represents our investment advisory activities which include credit funds managed by the Company and NewStar
Capital. Credit funds managed by the Company focus on co-invest middle market loans originated through our leveraged finance lending platform,
liquid tradeable credit and liquid loan strategies. NewStar Capital manages assets across a series of CLOs that invest primarily in broadly syndicated
loans, as well as other sponsored funds and managed accounts that invest across various liquid, non-investment grade asset classes, including broadly
syndicated loans and bonds.

Note 17. Subsequent Events

On October 16, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with First Eagle Holdings, Inc.
(“First Eagle”), FE Holdco, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Eagle (“FE Holdco”), and a newly formed wholly-owned merger subsidiary of FE
Holdco, pursuant to which the merger subsidiary will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of FE Holdco. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, stockholders are expected to receive $11.44 in upfront
cash and one non-transferable contingent value right (CVR) for each share of Company common stock held at closing of the transaction. Each CVR will
entitle its holder to receive pro-rata distributions of any tax refunds received by the Company following the closing as a result of a carryback of the
Company’s losses generated primarily from the sale of assets to the Asset Buyer (as defined below). The Company estimates these refunds to total $1.00
per share if the transaction closes in 2017, or $0.88 per share if the transaction closes in 2018. In a related transaction, NewStar has entered into a
definitive agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) to sell a portfolio of investment assets, including approximately $2.4 billion of middle-market
loans and other credit investments, to a newly formed investment fund sponsored by GSO Capital Partners LP, the global credit investment platform of
Blackstone Group L.P. (the “Asset Buyer”). The closing of First Eagle’s acquisition of NewStar is conditioned upon, and will occur immediately
following, the Asset Buyer’s completion of the acquisition of such assets. In addition to the closing of the asset sale, completion of the merger is subject
to certain additional conditions, including the receipt of the necessary approval of the Company’s stockholders, the satisfaction of certain regulatory
approvals and specified client consents, and other customary closing conditions. In addition to stockholder approval, completion of the asset sale is
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to closing under the definitive merger agreement, the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals
and other customary closing conditions.

On November 1, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.02 per share, to be paid on December 15, 2017 to stockholders of record
on November 29, 2017.

2012-1 CLO. On October 20, 2017, we called the 2012-2 CLO Trust and redeemed the notes at par. In conjunction with the redemption, we
received a cash principal distribution of $22.6 million.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Important factors that may cause actual results and circumstances to differ
materially from those described in such statements are described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016,
[as supplemented by the risks outline under Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,] as well as throughout this Item 2. You are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this document. These statements speak only as of the date of this
document, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements, except as may be required by law.

Overview

NewStar Financial, Inc. (which is referred to throughout this Quarterly Report as “NewStar”, “the Company”, “we” and “us”) is an internally-
managed, middle market direct lender and credit-oriented asset manager headquartered in Boston, MA. The Company’s direct lending activities are
focused on meeting the complex financing needs of companies and private investors in the middle market by offering a range of flexible debt financing
options. The Company also offers a range of investment management products employing credit-oriented strategies focused on middle market loans and
liquid, tradeable credit. The Company manages approximately $7.2 billion of assets, $3.6 billion held in consolidated subsidiaries of the Company and
$3.6 billion in off balance sheet credit funds. The Company continues to transition from an on balance sheet commercial lender towards an asset
manager for third parties, as a result the growth is primarily focused on off-balance sheet managed funds.

Below is a summary of where our Assets Under Management (“AUM”) are held as of September 30, 2017.
 

NewStar operates its business through two reportable segments: Commercial Lending and Asset Management.

Commercial Lending

We believe our commercial lending activities require specialized skills and transaction experience, as well as a significant investment in personnel
and operating infrastructure. To meet these demands, our loans are originated directly by teams of credit-trained bankers. These teams are supported by
centralized credit management and operating platforms. This structure enables us to leverage common standards, systems, and industry and professional
expertise across multiple businesses.

We target our marketing and origination efforts at private equity firms, mid-sized companies, corporate executives, banks and a variety of other
referral sources and financial intermediaries to develop new customer relationships and source lending opportunities. Our origination network is national
in scope and we target companies with business operations across a broad range of industry sectors. We employ highly experienced bankers and credit
professionals to identify and structure new lending opportunities and manage customer relationships. We believe that the quality of our professionals,
the breadth of their relationships and referral networks, and their ability to develop creative solutions for customers position us to be a valued partner
and preferred lender for mid-sized companies and private equity funds with middle market investment strategies.

Table of Contents

The Company’s emphasis on direct origination is an important aspect of our marketing and credit strategy. The Company’s national network is
designed around specialized origination channels intended to generate a large set of potential lending opportunities. That allows the Company to be
highly selective in our credit process and to allocate capital to market segments that we believe represent the most attractive opportunities. Our direct
origination network also generates proprietary lending opportunities with yield characteristics that we believe would not otherwise be available through
intermediaries. In addition, direct origination provides us with direct access to management teams and enhances our ability to conduct detailed due
diligence and credit analysis of prospective borrowers. It also allows us to negotiate transaction terms directly with borrowers and, as a result, advise our
customers on financial strategies and capital structures, which we believe benefits our credit performance.

The size of financing commitments depends on various factors, including the type of loan, the credit characteristics of the borrower, the economic
characteristics of the loan, and our role in the transaction. We also selectively arrange larger transactions that we may retain on our balance sheet or
syndicate to other lenders, which include off balance sheet managed credit funds managed for third party institutional investors. By syndicating loans to
other lenders and the Company’s off balance sheet managed credit funds, we are able to provide larger financing commitments to our customers and
generate fee income, while limiting our risk exposure to single borrowers.

Asset Management

As a registered investment adviser, NewStar offers a range of investment products employing credit-oriented strategies focused on middle market
loans and liquid tradeable credit. The Company manages a series of private credit funds that co-invest in middle market loans originated through its
established leveraged finance lending platform. Through its registered investment adviser subsidiary, NewStar Capital, the Company also manages
assets across a series of CLOs that invest primarily in broadly syndicated loans, as well as other sponsored funds and managed accounts that invest
across various liquid, non-investment grade asset classes, including broadly syndicated loans and bonds.

Recent Developments

On October 16, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with First Eagle Holdings, Inc.
(“First Eagle”), FE Holdco, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Eagle (“FE Holdco”), and a newly formed wholly-owned merger subsidiary of FE
Holdco, pursuant to which the merger subsidiary will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of FE Holdco. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, stockholders are expected to receive $11.44 in upfront
cash and one non-transferable contingent value right (CVR) for each share of Company common stock held at closing of the transaction. Each CVR will
entitle its holder to receive pro-rata distributions of any tax refunds received by the Company following the closing as a result of a carryback of the
Company’s losses generated primarily from the sale of assets to the Asset Buyer (as defined below). The Company estimates these refunds to total $1.00
per share if the transaction closes in 2017, or $0.88 per share if the transaction closes in 2018. In a related transaction, NewStar has entered into a
definitive agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) to sell a portfolio of investment assets, including approximately $2.4 billion of middle-market
loans and other credit investments, to a newly formed investment fund sponsored by GSO Capital Partners LP, the global credit investment platform of
Blackstone Group L.P. (the “Asset Buyer”). The closing of First Eagle’s acquisition of NewStar is conditioned upon, and will occur immediately
following, the Asset Buyer’s completion of the acquisition of such assets. In addition to the closing of the asset sale, completion of the merger is subject
to certain additional conditions, including the receipt of the necessary approval of the Company’s stockholders, the satisfaction of certain regulatory
approvals and specified client consents, and other customary closing conditions. In addition to stockholder approval, completion of the asset sale is
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to closing under the definitive merger agreement, the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals
and other customary closing conditions.

On November 1, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.02 per share, to be paid on December 15, 2017 to stockholders of record
on November 29, 2017.

2012-1 CLO. On October 20, 2017, we called the 2012-2 CLO Trust and redeemed the notes at par. In conjunction with the call, we received a
principal distribution of $22.6 million.

Market Conditions

Market conditions in our primary target loan market tightened in the third quarter of 2017 as middle market loan volume and pricing decreased
versus last quarter. According to Thomson Reuters, overall middle market loan volume in the third quarter was $31.8 billion versus $45.4 billion last
quarter (revised upward) and versus $35.8 billion in the same period last year. The volume represented by new middle market transactions, as opposed
to refinancing transactions, decreased in the third quarter to $15.9 billion from $19.9 billion in the prior quarter and versus $18.9 billion in the same
quarter last year. Refinancing volume also decreased in the third quarter of 2017 to $14.9 billion from $19.9 billion in the prior quarter, and versus
$16.9 billion in the same quarter last year. As a percentage of total middle market volume, new transactions increased slightly in the third quarter to 52%
versus 50% last quarter, but decreased slightly versus 53% in the same period last year.

The pricing environment in our primary target market tightened in the third quarter as middle market loan yields were down to 6.0% from 6.2%
last quarter and down from 6.7% in the same quarter last year. Middle market loan yields continue to exhibit a premium versus large corporate loans
although yields in the large corporate market widened to 5.0% in the third quarter from 4.8% last quarter, but tightened versus 5.2% in the same quarter
last year.

Our direct lending platforms provide us with certain flexibility to allocate capital and redirect our origination focus to market segments with the
most favorable conditions in terms of demand and relative value. We believe that the yields on our new loan origination will continue to reflect a
combination of these broad market trends and shifts in the mix of loans we originate.

Conditions in our core funding markets have improved in 2017 and continued to improve through the third quarter. We believe conditions will
continue to improve throughout the year as comfort grows with regulatory issues and investors continue to favor high-yielding, shorter duration floating
rate bank loans and CLO bonds over fixed rate debt.

Total U.S. CLO year-to-date issuance through the third quarter of $82.0 billion represents a significant increase relative to $46.0 billion in the
same period last year. For reference, total U.S. CLO issuance in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $72.0 billion, $99.0 billion and $124.0 billion,
respectively. Along with the increasing momentum in CLO issuance, CLO credit spreads tightened throughout 2017, a trend we anticipate will continue
through the year as market conditions remain supportive for experienced managers such as NewStar to issue new CLOs. We also believe the availability
and cost of warehouse financing among banks remains accommodative as an increasing number of banks are providing this type of financing and
existing providers are expanding their lending activity. As a result, we believe that the terms and conditions for financings available to established firms
like NewStar will continue to be supportive.

Loan demand in the middle market is strongly influenced by the level of refinancing, acquisition activity and private investment, which is driven
largely by changes in the perceived risk environment, prevailing borrowing rates and private investment activity. These factors were generally favorable
as we originated $317 million of new loans at attractive yields in the third quarter. With attractive pricing, leverage below the broader loan market, and
equity contributions higher than the broader market, conditions in our primary target markets continue to remain favorable. We anticipate that demand
for loans and leases offered by the Company and conditions in our lending markets will remain supportive through 2017 and continue to provide
opportunities for us to increase our origination volume

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2017 AND 2016

NewStar’s basic and diluted income per share for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $0.11, on net income of $4.6 million. Our basic
and diluted income per share was $0.24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 on net income of $10.1 million. This compares to basic and
diluted income per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $0.19, on net income of $8.6 million and basic and diluted income per share
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $0.38 on net income of $17.9 million. Our managed portfolio was $7.2 billion at September 30, 2017
compared to $6.7 billion at December 31, 2016.

Loan portfolio yield

Loan portfolio yield, which is interest income on our loans divided by the average balances outstanding of our loans and leases, was 6.44% and
6.38% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 6.77% and 6.38%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively. The loan portfolio yield in the three months ended September 30, 2017 decreased from the same period in the prior year, primarily related
to a pay-off of a nonperforming loan at par on which we recognized $3.2 million of interest income during the third quarter of 2016. The loan portfolio
yield in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was consistent with the prior year. It was positively impacted during the period by increasing
LIBOR rates and the sale of Equipment Finance and Business Credit, which was partially offset by an increase in the volume of our broadly syndicated
loans which are lower yielding.

Net interest margin

Net interest margin, which is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets, was 1.61% and 1.54% for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2017 and 2.50% and 2.25% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The primary factors impacting
the net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 were liabilities re-pricing faster than assets due to the LIBOR floor on
assets, higher levels of liquidity due to the sale of Equipment Finance and Business Credit and a change in the composition of interest earning assets to
include a greater amount of broadly syndicated loans, which typically are lower yielding. In addition to the change in loan composition, loans
represented a smaller portion of the average interest earning asset balance as the Company continues to transition from an on balance sheet commercial
lender towards an asset manager. The net interest margin was also impacted by lower amortization of deferred loans fees due to decreased prepayments,
and an increase in the LIBOR.

Operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets

Operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets was 1.20% and 1.14% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and
1.76% and 1.58% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease period over period was primarily due to a decrease in
operating expenses, specifically compensation and strategic initiative expenses, as a result of cost saving targets and sales of Equipment Finance and
Business Credit, implemented during the prior year, while average total assets slightly declined from the same period in the prior year. Decline in
average total assets is the result of the Company’s transition from an on balance sheet commercial lender towards an asset manager for third parties.

Operating expenses as a percentage of average assets under management

Operating expenses as a percentage of average assets under management was 0.67% and 0.66% for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2017 and 1.09% and 0.95% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2017 as compared to the comparable periods in 2016 was primarily due to a reduction of compensation and strategic initiative expenses
and the sale of Equipment Finance and Business Credit.

Efficiency ratio

Our efficiency ratio, which is total operating expenses divided by net interest income before provision for credit losses plus total non-interest
income, was 56.32% and 55.06% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 49.88% and 46.51% for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively. The decrease in our efficiency ratio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily related to non-interest income activity. Our year to date non-interest income activity
decreased $17.6 million from the previous year, which was primarily related to the gain on sale of Business Credit recognized in 2016 and negative
mark to market adjustments recognized during the current year, offset by the loss on total return swap and loss on loans held-for-sale during 2016.

Allowance for credit losses ratio

Allowance for credit losses ratio, which is allowance for credit losses divided by outstanding gross loans excluding loans held-for-sale and fair
value portfolios, was 1.52% at September 30, 2017 and 1.76% as of December 31, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we
recorded $3.9 million of specific provision for credit losses bringing the year to date specific provision for credit losses on impaired loans to
$13.4 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we had charge offs of $8.6 million bringing the year to date charge offs to
$21.5 million. At September 30, 2017, the specific allowance for credit losses was $11.7 million, and the general allowance for credit losses was
$28.5 million. At December 31, 2016, the specific allowance for credit losses was $19.8 million, and the general allowance for credit losses was
$31.6 million.

Delinquent loan rate

Delinquent loan rate, which is total delinquent loans net of charge offs with outstanding cash receivables that are 60 days or more past due,
divided by outstanding gross loans, was 1.20% as of September 30, 2017 as compared to 0.64% as of December 31, 2016. We had delinquent loans with
an outstanding balance of $36.7 million and $21.1 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The delinquent loan rate
increased as the result of one new borrower during the quarter and a smaller on balance sheet loan portfolio. We expect the delinquent loan rate to
correlate to current economic conditions. During times of economic expansion we expect the rate to decline, and during times of economic contraction,
we expect the rate to increase, although actual results may vary.

Non-accrual loan rate

Non-accrual loan rate is defined as total balances outstanding of loans on non-accrual status divided by the total outstanding balance of our loans
held for investment. Loans are put on non-accrual status if they are 90 days or more past due or if management believes it is probable that the Company
will be unable to collect contractual principal and interest in the normal course of business. The non-accrual loan rate was 3.39% as of September 30,
2017 and 2.99% as of December 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the aggregate outstanding balance of non-accrual loans
was $103.8 million and $99.2 million, respectively and total outstanding loans held for investment was $3.1 billion at September 30, 2017 and
$3.3 billion at December 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, these non-accrual loans had a carrying value before specific
reserves of $97.4 million and $92.9 million, respectively.

Non-performing asset rate

Non-performing asset rate is defined as the sum of total balances outstanding of loans on non-accrual status, other real estate owned (“OREO”)
and other repossessed assets, divided by the sum of the total outstanding balance of our loans held for investment and other real estate owned. The
non-performing asset rate was 3.88% as of September 30, 2017 and 3.45% as of December 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016,
the sum of the aggregate outstanding balance of non-performing assets was $119.4 million and $115.0 million, respectively.

Net charge off rate (end of period loans and leases)

Net charge off rate as a percentage of end of period loan and lease portfolio is defined as annualized charge-offs net of recoveries divided by the
total outstanding balance of our loans and leases held for investment. A charge-off occurs when management believes that all or part of the principal of a
particular loan is no longer recoverable and will not be repaid. Typically a charge-off occurs in a period after a loan has been identified as impaired and a
specific allowance has been established. The net charge-off rate was 1.11% and 0.94% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and
(0.01%) and 0.58% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, we had net
charge offs of $8.6 million and $21.5 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a small recovery and
net charge offs of $14.2 million, respectively.

Net charge off rate (average period loans and leases)

Net charge off rate as a percentage of average period loan and lease portfolio is defined as annualized charge-offs net of recoveries divided by the
average total outstanding balance of our loans and leases held for investment for the period. The net charge-off rate was 0.99% and 0.84% for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 respectively, and zero and 0.50% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
respectively.

Return on average assets

Return on average assets, which is net income divided by average total assets, was 0.46% and 0.34% for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2017, respectively, and 0.84% and 0.59% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 respectively.

Return on average equity

Return on average equity, which is net income divided by average equity, was 2.82% and 2.10% for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2017 respectively, and 5.16% and 3.61% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 respectively.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 and 2016

Interest income. Interest income decreased $6.4 million, to $58.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 from $65.2 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of our interest earning assets to
$3.8 billion from $4.0 billion and a decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets to 6.07% from 6.45%. Decline in the average balance of
interest earning assets is the result of the Company’s transition from an on balance sheet commercial lender towards an asset manager for third parties.
In addition to the decline in the average balance the composition of average interest earning assets has changed from the third quarter of 2016 due to the
sale of Equipment Finance and an increase in broadly syndicated loans, which typically are lower yielding. During the quarter ended September 30,
2016 we had a nonperforming loan pay off at par on which we recognized $3.2 million of interest income.

Interest expense. Interest expense increased $3.2 million, to $43.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 from $39.9 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the increase in LIBOR over the past year. The average cost of funds
increased to 5.21% from 4.62%.

Net interest margin. Net interest margin decreased to 1.61% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 from 2.50% for the three months
ended September 30, 2016. The primary factors impacting the net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2017 were liabilities
repricing faster than assets due to the LIBOR floor on assets, higher levels of liquidity due to the sale of Equipment Finance and Business Credit and a
change in the composition of interest earning assets to include a greater amount of broadly syndicated loans, which typically are lower yielding. In
addition to the change in loan composition, loans represented a smaller portion of the average interest earning asset balance. The net interest margin was
also impacted by lower amortization of deferred loans fees due to decreased prepayments, and an increase in the LIBOR.

September 30, 2017 and 2016:

Provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses decreased $2.1 million to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017
from $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we recorded net specific
provisions for impaired loans of $3.9 million compared to $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Our general allowance for credit
losses covers estimated incurred losses in our loan portfolio with respect to loans that are not impaired and for which no specific impairment has been
identified. A specific provision for credit losses is recorded with respect to loans for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts
due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement for which there is impairment recognized. The Company employs a variety of
internally developed and third-party modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk, which are used in developing an allowance for loan losses
on outstanding loans. The Company’s allowance framework addresses economic conditions, capital market liquidity and industry circumstances from
both a top-down and bottom-up perspective. The Company considers and evaluates a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in
economic conditions, credit availability, industry, loss emergence period, and multiple obligor concentrations, in assessing both probabilities of default
and loss severities as part of the general component of the allowance for loan and losses.

On at least a quarterly basis, loans are internally risk-rated based on individual credit criteria, including loan type, loan structures (including
balloon and bullet structures common in the Company’s Leveraged Finance and Real Estate loans), borrower industry, payment capacity, location and
quality of collateral if any (including the Company’s Real Estate loans). Borrowers provide the Company with financial information on either a monthly
or quarterly basis. Ratings, corresponding assumed default rates and assumed loss severities are dynamically updated to reflect any changes in borrower
condition or profile.

For Leveraged Finance loans and Equipment Finance (prior to the sale of the latter) loans, the data set used to construct probabilities of default in
its allowance for loan losses model, Moody’s CRD Private Firm Database, primarily contains middle market loans that share attributes similar to the
Company’s loans. The Company also considers the quality of the loan terms and lender protections in determining a loan loss in the event of default.

Prior to the sale of Business Credit, the Company utilized a proprietary model to risk rate the asset based loans on a monthly basis. This model
captured the impact of changes in industry and economic conditions as well

as changes in the quality of the borrower’s collateral and financial performance to assign a final risk rating. The Company also evaluated historical net
loss trends by risk rating from a comprehensive industry database covering more than twenty-five years of experience of the majority of the asset based
lenders operating in the United States. Based upon the monthly risk rating from the model, the reserve was adjusted to reflect the historical average for
expected loss from the industry database.

For real estate loans, the Company employs two mechanisms to capture the impact of industry and economic conditions. First, a loan’s risk rating,
and thereby its assumed default likelihood, can be adjusted to account for overall commercial real estate market conditions. Second, to the extent that
economic or industry trends adversely affect a substandard rated borrower’s loan-to-value ratio enough to impact its repayment ability, the Company
applies a stress multiplier to the loan’s probability of default. The multiplier is designed to account for default characteristics that are difficult to quantify
when market conditions cause commercial real estate prices to decline.

The Company periodically reviews its allowance for credit loss methodology to assess any necessary adjustments based upon changing economic
and capital market conditions. If the Company determines that changes in its allowance for credit losses methodology are advisable, as a result of
changes in the economic environment or otherwise, the revised allowance methodology may result in higher or lower levels of allowance. Actual losses
under the Company’s current or any revised allowance methodology may differ materially from the Company’s estimate.

Additionally, when determining the amount of the general allowance, the Company supplements the base amount with an environmental reserve
amount which is governed by a score card system comprised of seven risk factors. The Company also performs a ratio analysis of comparable money
center banks, regional banks and finance companies. While the Company does not rely on this peer group comparison to set the level of allowance for
credit losses, it does assist management in identifying market trends and serves as an overall reasonableness check on the allowance for credit losses
computation.

A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the
loan agreement. The measurement of impairment of a loan is based upon (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s
effective interest rate, (ii) the loan’s observable market price, or (iii) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, depending on the
circumstances and our collection strategy. Impaired loans are identified based on the loan-by-loan risk rating process described above. Impaired loans
include all non-accrual loans, loans with partial charge-offs and loans which are troubled debt restructurings. It is the Company’s policy during the
reporting period to record a specific provision for credit losses to cover the identified impairment on a loan.

Impaired loans at September 30, 2017 were in Leveraged Finance over a range of industries impacted by the current economic environment
including the following: Media and Communications, Healthcare, Energy, Industrial, Other Business Services, Consumer/Retail, and Building Materials.
The Company measured impairment based on expected cash flows utilizing relevant information provided by the borrower and consideration of other
market conditions or specific factors impacting recoverability. Such amounts are discounted based on original loan terms. As of September 30, 2017, we
had impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $153.7 million. Impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $85.1 million
have been restructured and classified as TDRs. At September 30, 2017, the Company had a $11.7 million specific allowance for impaired loans with an
aggregate outstanding balance of $100.1 million. As of September 30, 2017, we had two restructured impaired loans that had an outstanding balance
greater than $20 million. In each of these cases, we added to our position to maximize our potential recovery of the outstanding principal.

Non-interest income. Non-interest income decreased $5.5 million, to $5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 from
$11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily the result of negative mark-to-market
adjustment on loans held at fair value for the three months ended September 30, 2017.

Operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased $6.2 million, to $11.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 from
$18.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Compensation and benefits expense decreased $5.7 million reflecting targeted cost
savings from actions taken over the last twelve months to streamline operations. General and administrative expenses decreased $0.5 million, primarily
related to a decrease in strategic initiative costs.

Income taxes. For the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, we provided for income taxes based on an effective tax rate of 41% in
each period.

As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had net deferred tax assets of $32.1 million and $40.8 million, respectively. In assessing if
we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. We considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets at
September 30, 2017. We considered carryback availability, the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income during the
reversal periods, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. We also considered our recent history of taxable income, trends in our earnings
and tax rate, positive financial ratios, and the current economic environment (including the impact of credit on allowance and provision for loan losses,
and the impact on funding levels). Based upon our assessment, we believe that a valuation allowance was not necessary as of September 30, 2017. As of
September 30, 2017, our deferred tax asset was primarily comprised of $19.2 million related to our allowance for credit losses, $5.6 million related to
income from non-performing loans and $7.0 million related to compensation.

Equity positions. In addition to receiving an equity interest in a borrower as a result of certain of our troubled debt restructurings, we may from
time to time make an immaterial equity investment alongside our loan to a borrower. These equity interests are initially recorded at fair value. In
situations where we determine the fair value has declined from the initial fair value recorded, we write-down the value of the equity interest in
non-interest income. These equity interests may give rise to potential capital gains or losses, for tax purposes. This could impact future period tax rates
depending on our ability to recognize capital losses to the extent of any capital gains.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 and 2016

Interest income. Interest income decreased $15.8 million, to $170.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from $186.5 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of our interest earning assets and a
decrease in yield. Decline in the average balance of interest earning assets is the result of the Company’s transition from an on balance sheet commercial
lender towards an asset manager for third parties. In addition to the decline in the average balance the composition of our interest earning assets changed
as a result of our sale of Business Credit and Equipment Finance. These assets were primarily replaced by broadly syndicated loans which are lower
yielding.

Interest expense. Interest expense increased $8.3 million, to $126.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from $117.8 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the increasing interest rate environment as well as the average cost of funds
increasing to 5.09% from 4.62%.

Net interest margin. Net interest margin decreased to 1.54% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from 2.25% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to liabilities re-pricing faster than assets due to the LIBOR floor on assets,
higher levels of liquidity due to sale of Business Credit and Equipment Finance and a change in composition of interest earning assets to include a
greater amount of broadly syndicated loans.

Provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses decreased $14.6 million to $10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017
from $24.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in the provision was due to a decrease of $8.9 million in specific
provisions recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and a release of
$3.1 million of general provision during the current year compared to providing a general provision of $2.6 million during the same period in the prior
year.

Non-interest income. Non-interest income decreased $17.6 million, to $16.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from
$34.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily driven by a $22.5 million gain on the
sale of Business Credit that occurred during the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by a $6.1 million loss on the TRS portfolio in 2016, and a
$4.8 million decrease in loss recognized on loans held-for-sale in 2017.

Operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased $14.2 million, to $33.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from
$48.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Compensation and benefits expense decreased $11.0 million primarily due to severance
costs associated with a reduction in staffing levels to streamline operations in 2016. General and administrative expenses decreased $3.2 million,
primarily related to a decrease in strategic initiative costs associated with the sale of Equipment Finance and other short term projects during 2016.

Income taxes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, we provided for income taxes based on an effective tax rate of
approximately 41% in each period.

Equity positions. In addition to receiving an equity interest in a borrower as a result of certain of our troubled debt restructurings, we may from
time to time make an immaterial equity investment alongside our loan to a borrower. These equity interests are initially recorded at fair value. In
situations where we determine the fair value has declined from the initial fair value recorded, we write-down the value of the equity interest in
non-interest income. These equity interests may give rise to potential capital gains or losses, for tax purposes. This could impact future period tax rates
depending on our ability to recognize capital losses to the extent of any capital gains.

between $15 million and $50 million owned by private equity investment funds and managed by established professional alternative asset managers.
The size of financing commitments depends on various factors, including the type of loan, the credit characteristics of the borrower, the economic
characteristics of the loan, and the Company’s role in the transaction. The Company may retain these loans on its balance sheet or allocate these loans to
off balance sheet managed credit funds managed the Company or other lenders. By allocating these loans to the Company’s off balance sheet managed
credit funds and other lenders, it is able to provide larger financing commitments to its customers and generate fee income, while limiting its risk
exposure to single borrowers.

The Commercial Lending segment reported income before taxes of $6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared
to $9.7 million for the same period in 2016. Net interest income decreased $9.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the
three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of a decrease in average interest earning assets and a decrease in the average yield on
interest earning assets. In addition, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 we had a nonperforming loan pay off at par on which we recognized
$3.2 million of interest income. The provision for loan loss amounted to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to
$3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Noninterest income derived from the Commercial Lending segment totaled $2.9 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2017, down from $4.0 million from the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 and 2016

The Commercial Lending segment reported income before taxes of $15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared
to $20.9 million for the same period in 2016. Net interest income decreased $24.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of a decrease in average interest earning assets driven by the sale of Business Credit
and Equipment Finance during 2016 and a decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets. The provision for loan loss amounted to $10.3 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $24.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Noninterest income derived
from the Commercial Lending segment totaled $11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, down from $20.1 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease of $8.4 million in noninterest income was primarily due to a $22.5 million gain on the sale of Business
Credit in 2016 offset by higher lending fees and lower marks on loans held-for-sale in 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.

Asset Management

The Asset Management segment represents our investment advisory activities which include credit funds managed by the Company and NewStar

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 and 2016

The Asset Management segment reported income before taxes of $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared
to $4.8 million for the same period in 2016 primarily due to non-interest income. Noninterest income was primarily the result of asset management and
performance fee income of $3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, an increase of $0.2 million compared to the same period
in 2016. This was offset by a negative mark to market adjustment of $0.9 million on loans held at fair value during the three months ended
September 30, 2017 compared to a $3.4 million positive mark to market adjustment for the same period in 2016.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 and 2016

The Asset Management segment reported income before taxes of $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared
to $9.4 million for the same period in 2016 primarily due to non-interest income. Noninterest income was primarily the result of asset management and
performance fee income of $11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, an increase of $0.7 million compared to the same period
in 2016. This was offset by a negative mark to market adjustment of $6.8 million on loans held at fair value during the nine months ended September 30,
2017 compared to a $3.7 million positive mark to market adjustment for the same period in 2016.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash flow from operations, credit facilities, term debt securitizations and proceeds from equity and debt
offerings. We believe that these sources will be sufficient to fund our current operations, lending activities, stock repurchases, dividends and other short-
term liquidity needs. In addition, we had $371.9 million in net loans held-for-sale on our balance sheet at September 30, 2017, which we have the ability
to sell to generate additional liquidity. Subject to market conditions, we continue to explore opportunities for the Company to increase its leverage,
including through the issuance of high yield debt securities, convertible debt securities, share repurchases, secured or unsecured senior debt or revolving
credit facilities, to support loan portfolio growth and/or strategic acquisitions, which may be material to us. In addition to opportunistic funding related
to potential growth initiatives, our future liquidity needs will be determined primarily based on prevailing market and economic conditions, the credit
performance of our loan portfolio and

loan origination volume. We may need to raise additional capital in the future based on various factors including, but not limited to: faster than expected
increases in the level of non-accrual loans; lower than anticipated recoveries or cash flow from operations; and unexpected limitations on our ability to
fund certain loans with credit facilities. We may not be able to raise debt or equity capital on acceptable terms or at all. The incurrence of additional debt
will increase our leverage and interest expense, and the issuance of any equity or securities exercisable, convertible or exchangeable into Company
common stock may be dilutive for existing shareholders.

During the third quarter of 2017, the U.S. economy continued to exhibit slow-to-moderate growth. Despite uncertainty surrounding a number of
economic issues and a new administration, the third quarter saw generally positive results from leading economic indicators in the labor market,
housing, manufacturing, equipment spending and equities. We expect stable trends and slow-to-moderate growth in the U.S. to continue and monetary
policy to remain conducive to gradual growth in the near term. We expect Treasury and investment grade bond rates to gradually increase, but remain
relatively low in the near term, leading investors to continue to focus on allocating capital to riskier, higher yielding, fixed and floating rate asset classes
in order to generate additional yield from their investments. In addition, we believe that the CLO market, which the Company partially relies upon for
funding, will continue to improve in 2017 and remain supportive for experienced managers such as NewStar to issue CLOs. We believe the Company
has substantially greater financial flexibility and increased financing options due to our market experience and improvement in our financial
performance.

We believe that our ability to access the capital markets, secure new credit facilities, and renew, reset and/or amend our existing credit facilities
continues to demonstrate an overall improvement in the market conditions for funding and indicates progress in our ability to obtain financings on
improved terms in the future. Despite these signs of improving market conditions and relative stability in recent years, we cannot assure these conditions
will continue, and it is possible that the financial markets could experience stress, volatility, and/or illiquidity. If they do, we could face materially higher
financing costs and reductions in leverage, which would affect our operating strategy and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had $62.5 million and $154.5 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. We may
invest a portion of cash on hand in short-term liquid investments. From time to time, we may use a portion of our unrestricted cash to pay down our
credit facilities creating undrawn capacity which may be redrawn to meet liquidity needs in the future. The change in cash and cash equivalents from
December 31, 2016 relates to cash received from the sale of Equipment Finance within the December 31, 2016 balance. Subsequent to year end we paid
down our warehouse facilities as well as equity funded a portion of our newly originated loans.

Restricted Cash

Separately, we had $251.7 million and $262.6 million of restricted cash as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The
restricted cash represents the balance of the principal and interest collections accounts and pre-funding amounts in our credit facilities, our term debt
securitizations and customer holdbacks and escrows. The use of the principal collection accounts’ cash is limited to funding the growth of our loan
portfolio within the facilities or paying down related credit facilities or term debt securitizations. As of September 30, 2017, we could use $170.7 million
of restricted cash to fund new or existing loans. The interest collection account cash is limited to the payment of interest, servicing fees and other
expenses of our credit facilities and term debt securitizations and, if either a ratings downgrade or failure to receive ratings confirmation occurs on the
rated notes in a term debt securitization at the end of the funding period or if coverage ratios are not met, paying down principal with respect thereto.
Cash to fund the growth of our loan portfolio and to pay interest on our term debt securitizations represented a large portion of our restricted cash
balance at September 30, 2017.

Cash Collateral on Deposit with Custodians

We had $7.6 million of cash collateral posted with custodians at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. These amounts represent cash
posted as collateral for our repurchase agreements. At September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had $7.1 million posted against our JP Morgan
Chase Bank repurchase agreement, $0.3 million posted against our Citibank Global Markets repurchase agreement and $0.2 million posted against our
Natixis repurchase agreement. The amount of cash posted as collateral under these credit agreements will vary from time to time as the market value of
the underlying assets fluctuates with the changes in the market.

Investment in Debt Securities, Available- for- Sale

The fair value of investment in debt securities, available for sale is based on prices received from third parties and reviewed by our pricing and
valuation committee. Our investment in debt securities, available for sale is considered Level 3. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we
purchased $52.7 million of debt securities available-for-sale, a $5.9 million par value investment debt securities was redeemed, and we received a
$0.2 million par paydown.

At September 30, 2017, the fair value of investment in debt securities, available for sale was $175.8 million with a net unrealized gain of
$3.4 million, compared to a fair value of $119.3 million and an unrealized loss of $6.1 million at December 31, 2016.

As a result of our evaluation of the securities, we concluded that the unrealized losses at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were caused
by changes in market prices driven by interest rates and credit spreads. Our evaluation of impairment include quotes from third parties, adjustments to
prepayment speeds, delinquency, an analysis of expected cash flows, interest rates, market discount rates, other contract terms, and the timing and level
of losses on the loans and leases within the underlying trusts. At September 30, 2017, we determined that it is not more likely than not that we will be
required to sell the securities before we recover the amortized cost basis in the security. We have also determined that there has not been an adverse
change in the cash flows expected to be collected. Based upon our impairment review process, and our ability and intent to hold these securities until
maturity or a recovery of fair value, the decline in the value of these investments is not considered to be “Other Than Temporary.”

Loans-Held-for-Sale

Loans classified as held-for-sale consist of loans originated by us and intended to be sold to third parties (including off balance sheet credit funds
managed by the Company).

These loans are carried at the lower of aggregate cost, net of any deferred origination costs or fees, or market value.

As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, loans held-for-sale consisted of the following:

Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

If a loan is 90 days or more past due, or if management believes it is probable we will be unable to collect contractual principal and interest in the
normal course of business, it is our policy to place the loan on non-accrual status. If a loan financed by a term debt securitization is placed on
non-accrual status, the loan may remain in the term debt securitization and excess interest spread cash distributions to us will cease until cash
accumulated in the term debt securitization equals the outstanding balance of the non-accrual loan, or if an overcollateralization test is present and the
overcollateralization ratio is (or was previously) out of compliance with the target, excess interest spread cash is diverted, and used to de-lever the
securitization to bring the ratio back into compliance. When a loan is on non-accrual status, accrued interest previously recognized as interest income
subsequent to the last cash receipt in the current year will be reversed, and the recognition of interest income on that loan will stop until factors
indicating doubtful collection no longer exist and the loan has been brought current. We may make exceptions to this policy if the loan is well secured
and is in the process of collection. As of September 30, 2017, we had impaired loans with a balance of $153.7 million. Impaired loans with an aggregate
outstanding balance of $85.1 million have been restructured and classified as troubled debt restructurings. Impaired loans with an aggregate outstanding
balance of $103.8 million were on non-accrual status. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we had net charge-offs totaling $21.5 million
of impaired loans. Impaired loans of $36.7 million were greater than 60 days past due and classified as delinquent. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2017, we recorded $13.4 million of net specific provisions for impaired loans. Included in our specific allowance for impaired loans was
$5.1 million related to delinquent loans.

We closely monitor the credit quality of our loans which are partly reflected in our credit metrics such as loan delinquencies, non-accruals, and
charge-offs. Changes to these credit metrics are largely due to changes in economic conditions and seasoning of the loan portfolio.

We have provided an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Our allowance for loan losses as of
September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $39.8 million and $50.9 million, respectively, or 1.50% and 1.75% of loans, gross, respectively. As of
September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we also had a $0.5 million allowance for unfunded commitments, resulting in an allowance for credit
losses of 1.52% of loans, gross at September 30, 2017 compared to 1.76% at December 31, 2016.

The allowance for credit losses is based on a review of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses and its two components on a
quarterly basis. The estimate of each component is based on observable information and on market and third-party data believed to be reflective of the
underlying credit losses being estimated.

It is the Company’s policy to record a specific provision for credit losses for all loans for which we have identified impairments during the
reporting period. We may charge-off the portion of the loan for which a specific provision was recorded. All of these loans are classified as impaired (if
they have not been so classified already as a result of a troubled debt restructuring) and are disclosed in the Allowance for Credit Losses footnote to the
financial statements.

(1) Maturities for term debt are based on contractual maturity dates. Actual maturities may occur earlier.

We must comply with various covenants in our debt facilities. The breach of certain of these covenants could result in a termination event and the
exercise of remedies if not cured. At September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all such covenants. These covenants are customary and include,
but are not limited to, failure to service debt obligations, failure to meet liquidity covenants and tangible net worth covenants, and failure to remain
within prescribed facility portfolio delinquency, charge-off levels, and overcollateralization tests.

Credit Facilities

As of September 30, 2017 we had two credit facilities through certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) a $615.0 million credit facility with
syndicated lenders agented by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) to fund leveraged finance loans, and (ii) a $250.0 million credit
facility with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) to fund leveraged finance loans.

Table of Contents

Our $615.0 million credit facility with syndicated lenders agented by Wells Fargo to fund leveraged finance loans had an outstanding balance of
$368.9 million and unamortized deferred financing fees of $5.0 million as of September 30, 2017. Interest on this facility accrues at a variable rate per
annum. This facility matures on August 10, 2020. The facility provides for a revolving reinvestment period which ends on August 10, 2018, with a
two-year amortization period.

Our $250.0 million credit facility with Citibank to fund leveraged finance loans had a $95.0 million outstanding balance and unamortized deferred
financing fees of $1.9 million as of September 30, 2017. Interest on this facility accrues at a variable rate per annum. The facility matures on May 5,
2020. It provides for a revolving reinvestment period which ends on May 5, 2018, with a two-year amortization period.

Senior notes

On April 22, 2015, we issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). On November 9,
2015, we issued an additional $80.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes at a debt discount of $0.8 million which will amortize over the
life of the 2020 Notes. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the April 2015 notes offering to repay in full our corporate credit facility with
Fortress Credit Corp. The 2020 Notes mature on May 1, 2020, and bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per annum, which is payable semi-annually on May 1
and November 1 of each year. On or after May 1, 2017, we may redeem the 2020 Notes, in whole or in part, at redemption prices specified in the 2020
Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In addition, if we undergo a change of control, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each
holder’s 2020 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 2020 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of September 30, 2017,
unamortized deferred financing fees were $4.3 million.

We must comply with certain covenants and restrictions related to the 2020 Notes. Subject to certain exceptions, the indenture relating to the 2020
Notes restricts our ability to incur additional Non-Funding Indebtedness (as defined in the indenture) but permits the incurrence of indebtedness if on the
date of such incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto, our Consolidated Non-Funding Debt to Equity Ratio (together with our Restricted
Subsidiaries) is not greater than 1.75 to 1.00. Our Consolidated Non-Funding Debt to Equity Ratio is defined as the ratio of our Consolidated
Non-Funding Debt (as defined in the indenture) of such person as of such determination date to our Consolidated Stockholders Equity (as defined in the
indenture). If we fail to comply with this and certain other covenants included in the senior notes indenture, it could constitute an event of default that
could result in the acceleration of the payment of the aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes then outstanding and accrued interest. At September 30,
2017 and currently, we were in compliance with all such covenants under the 2020 Notes indenture.

Subordinated notes

On December 4, 2014, we completed the initial closing of an investment of long-term capital from funds sponsored by Franklin Square Capital
Partners (“Franklin Square”) and sub-advised by GSO Capital Partners at which the Franklin Square funds purchased $200.0 million of 10-year
subordinated notes (the “Subordinated Notes”), which rank junior to our existing and future senior debt. During 2015, we drew an additional $75 million
of Subordinated Notes. We drew the remaining $25 million in January 2016. The Subordinated Notes were recorded at par less the initial relative fair
value of the warrants issued in connection with the investment in December 2014 and January 2015, which was $48.6 million as of September 30, 2017
and $53.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The debt discount will amortize over the life of the notes and will be recorded as non-cash interest expense
as the Subordinated Notes accrete to par value. As of September 30, 2017, unamortized deferred financing fees were $4.4 million. The Subordinated
Notes bear interest at 8.25% and include a Payment-in-Kind (“PIK Toggle”) feature that allows us, at our option, to elect to have interest accrued at a
rate of 8.75% added to the principal of the Subordinated Notes instead of paying it in cash. The Subordinated Notes have a ten year term and mature on
December 4, 2024. They are callable during the first three years with payment of a make-whole premium. The prepayment premium decreases to 103%
and 101% after the third and

fourth anniversaries of the closing, respectively. They are callable at par after December 4, 2019. Beginning on December 5, 2019, we are required to
make a cash payment of principal plus accrued interest in an amount required to prevent the Subordinated Notes from being treated as an “Applicable
High Yield Discount Obligation” within the meaning of Section 163(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Events of default under
the Subordinated Notes include failure to pay interest or principal when due subject to applicable grace periods, material uncured breaches of the terms
of the Subordinated Notes, and bankruptcy/insolvency events.

We are subject to certain covenants for so long as Franklin Square holds at least $50 million aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Notes.
During this period, (i) the percentage of our gross revenue derived from investment and asset management fees in any fiscal year may not exceed 15%
of our gross revenues for such fiscal year and (ii) we may not incur or permit any subsidiary of ours to incur any Indebtedness (as defined in the
Investment Agreement related to the Subordinated Notes), if on the date of such incurrence and after giving effect thereto on a pro forma basis, our Total
Leverage Ratio would be greater than 5.50 to 1.00. Total Leverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) all of our Indebtedness and the Indebtedness of our
consolidated subsidiaries, except for Indebtedness of non-majority owned finance subsidiaries and the Subordinated Notes and other pari passu
subordinated debt to (ii) our shareholders’ equity plus the Subordinated Notes and such other pari passu subordinated debt.

Term Debt Securitizations

2012-2 CLO. On December 18, 2012, we completed a term debt securitization transaction. In conjunction with this transaction we established a
separate single-purpose bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, NewStar Commercial Loan Funding 2012-2 LLC (the “2012-2 CLO”) and sold and contributed
$325.9 million in loans and investments (including unfunded commitments), or portions thereof, to the 2012-2 CLO. We remain the servicer of the
loans. Simultaneously with the initial sale and contribution, the 2012-2 CLO issued $263.3 million of notes to institutional investors. We retained
$62.6 million, comprising 100% of the 2012-2 CLO’s membership interests, Class E notes, Class F notes, and subordinated notes. On June 12, 2015, we
sold 100% of the 2012-2 CLO’s Class E Notes totaling $16.3 million to institutional investors. At September 30, 2017, the $142.3 million of outstanding
drawn notes were collateralized by the specific loans and investments, principal collection account cash and principal payment receivables totaling
$188.6 million. At September 30,

2017, unamortized deferred financing fees were $0.2 million. The 2012-2 CLO permitted reinvestment of collateral principal repayments for a three-
year period which ended in January 2016.

We receive a loan collateral management fee and excess interest spread. We also receive payments with respect to the classes of notes we own in
accordance with the transaction documents. We expect to receive a principal distribution as owner of the membership interests when the term debt is
retired. If loan collateral in the 2012-2 CLO is in default under the terms of the indenture, the excess interest spread from the 2012-2 CLO may not be
distributed if the overcollateralization ratio, or other collateral quality tests, is not satisfied.

2014-1 CLO. On April 17, 2014, we completed a term debt securitization transaction through our separate single-purpose bankruptcy-remote
subsidiary, NewStar Commercial Loan Funding 2014-1 LLC (the “2014-1 CLO”) and sold and contributed $249.6 million in loans and investments
(including unfunded commitments), or portions thereof, to the 2014-1 CLO. We remain the servicer of the loans. Simultaneously with the initial sale and
contribution, the 2014-1 CLO issued $289.5 million of notes to institutional investors. We retained $58.9 million, comprising 100% of the 2014-1
CLO’s membership interests, Class E notes, Class F notes, and subordinated notes. At September 30, 2017, the $289.5 million of outstanding drawn
notes were collateralized by the specific loans and investments, principal collection account cash and principal payment receivables totaling
$348.4 million. At September 30, 2017, unamortized deferred financing fees were $1.5 million. The 2014-1 CLO permits reinvestment of collateral
principal repayments for a four-year period ending in April 2018. Should we determine that reinvestment of collateral principal repayments are
impractical in light of market conditions or if collateral principal repayments are not reinvested within a prescribed timeframe, such funds may be used
to repay the outstanding notes. Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Company has the right to redeem the 2014-1 CLO following the expiration of
the non-call period which occurred on the payment date in April 2016.

We receive a loan collateral management fee and excess interest spread. We also receive payments with respect to the classes of notes we own in

Arch Street CLO. On September 15, 2016, NewStar Capital LLC completed a $409.8 million broadly syndicated loan securitization. The notes
offered in the collateralized loan obligation (“Arch Street CLO”) were issued by Arch Street CLO, Ltd., an exempted company incorporated under the
laws of the Cayman Islands, and (with the exception of the Class E and F notes) by Arch Street CLO, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (each a
subsidiary of NewStar Capital and collectively, “Arch Street”). The Arch Street CLO notes are backed by a diversified portfolio of broadly syndicated
loans purchased and serviced by the Company. Investors purchased approximately $370.3 million of the Arch Street CLO notes, representing
approximately 90.4% of the total capitalization of Arch Street. The Company retained all of the Class F notes and subordinated notes which together
totaled approximately $39.5 million, representing approximately 9.6% of the total capitalization of Arch Street. At September 30, 2017, the outstanding
note balance was $367.8 million and unamortized deferred financing fees were $3.7 million. The reinvestment period is expected to end in October 2020

2017-1 CLO. On March 20, 2017 we completed a term debt securitization transaction through our separate single-purpose bankruptcy-remote
subsidiary, NewStar Commercial Loan Funding 2017-1 LLC (the “2017-1 CLO”). This securitization was a refinance of the NewStar Commercial Loan
Funding 2013-1 LLC term debt securitization completed on September 11, 2013. The Company remains the servicer of the loans. Simultaneously with
the refinance, the 2017-1 CLO issued $328.0 million of replacement notes to institutional investors. The Company retained the Class E-N replacement
notes and all of the equity which together totaled $69.3 million. At September 30, 2017, the $303.0 million of outstanding drawn replacement notes
were collateralized by the specific loans and investments, principal collection account cash and principal payment receivables totaling $372.3 million.
At September 30, 2017, unamortized deferred financing fees were $3.0 million. The reinvestment period is expected to end in March 2019 and the
replacement notes are expected scheduled to mature in October 2027. Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Company has the right to redeem the
2017-1 CLO following the expiration of the non-call period on the payment date in March 2019.

We receive a loan collateral management fee and excess interest spread. We also receive payments with respect to the classes of notes we own in

2013-1 CLO. On March 20, 2017, the Company refinanced the 2013-1 LLC and issued the 2017-1 CLO Replacement Notes. We accelerated and
recognized deferred financing fees of $0.3 million related to the refinance of the 2013-1 CLO.

On certain CLOs the Company, as collateral manager, is required to retain a prescribed interest in the securitization concerned in order to be in
compliance with EU Capital Requirements and the Dodd-Frank Act risk retention rules. The U.S. credit risk retention rules generally require that for
each CLO, the collateral manager retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the assets that underlie an asset backed securitization. This can be achieved
either through the retention of an “eligible vertical interest” (commonly referred to as a vertical strip), the retention of an “eligible horizontal residual
interest” (commonly referred to as a horizontal strip) or a combination of the two. The rule applies to CLOs maintained on balance sheet as well as
CLOs considered VIEs.

U.S. credit risk retention rules permit for the financing of a required retention interest, provided that such financing be on a full recourse basis. To
the extent that we employ leverage on our risk retention investments, that could cause losses to be larger than they would have been if leverage were not
employed.

Risk retention and certain limitations placed on some banks’ ability to hold CLO securities may inhibit future CLO creations, limit future lending
to middle market companies and also have broad implications for the senior secured loan marketplace and for middle market borrowers.

Repurchase Agreements

We entered into a repurchase transaction with Deutsche Bank AG, pursuant to the terms of a Global Master Repurchase Agreement (2000

Stock Repurchase Program

On December 9, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30.0 million of the Company’s common stock from
time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares purchased under the repurchase program
will be determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program commenced

immediately following the expiration of the prior stock repurchase program on December 31, 2016. The repurchase program will expire on
December 31, 2017 unless extended by the Board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. As of September 30, 2017, the
Company had repurchased 1,740,154 shares of common stock at a weighted average price per share of $10.17.

Dividend Policy

On February 14, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.02 per share paid on March 17, 2017 to stockholders of record on
March 2, 2017. On May 2, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.02 per share paid on June 15, 2017 to stockholders of record on
May 30, 2017. On July 31, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.02 per share paid on September 15, 2017 to stockholders of record on
August 29, 2017.

Our definitive merger agreement with First Eagle prohibits us from declaring cash dividends other than our regular quarterly cash dividend for the
fourth quarter 2017.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

We maintain an overall risk management strategy that may incorporate the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned
fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. Our operations are subject to risks resulting from interest rate fluctuations on our interest-
earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities. We seek to provide maximum levels of net interest income, while maintaining acceptable levels of
interest rate and liquidity risk. As such, we may enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure to interest
rate fluctuations on floating rate funding agreement liabilities that are matched with fixed rate securities. Under the interest rate swap contracts, we agree
to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
We record the exchanged amount in net interest income in our statements of operations. Under the interest rate cap contracts, we agree to exchange, at
specified intervals, the difference between a specified fixed interest (the cap) and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional
principal amount, but only if the floating interest rate exceeds the cap rate. The interest rate caps may not be matched to specific assets or liabilities and
would not qualify for hedge accounting.

Gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges, including any cash payments made or received, are reported as gain or (loss) on
derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our borrowers.
These financial instruments include unfunded commitments and standby letters of credit. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit
risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of
involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments.

Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for standby letters of credit is represented
by the contractual amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for
on-balance sheet instruments.

Unused lines of credit are commitments to lend to a borrower if certain conditions have been met. These commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Because certain commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the
total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each borrower’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
The amount of collateral required is based on factors that include management’s credit evaluation of the

borrower and the borrower’s compliance with financial covenants. Due to their nature, we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts that will be
required to fund our unfunded commitments. The aggregate amount of these unfunded commitments currently exceeds our available funds and will
likely continue to exceed our available funds in the future. At September 30, 2017, we had $303.9 million of unused lines of credit.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance by a borrower to a third party. The credit risk
involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending credit to our borrowers. At September 30, 2017, we had
$6.8 million of standby letters of credit.

On December 4, 2014, we entered into a total return swap (“TRS”) for senior floating rate loans with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”). The TRS with
Citibank enabled us, through a wholly owned financing subsidiary, to obtain the economic benefits of the loans subject to the TRS, despite the fact that
such loans would not be directly owned by us, in return for an interest payment to Citibank. The underlying loan portfolio of the TRS was typically
large, liquid broadly syndicated loans. We acted as the manager of the TRS and selected the specific loans to be subject to the TRS. The TRS did not
qualify for hedge accounting treatment as it did not offset the risks of another investment position. The initial maximum market value (determined at the
time such loans became subject to the TRS) of the portfolio of loans subject to the TRS was $75.0 million. On December 15, 2014, we entered into an
amendment to the TRS that increased the maximum value to $125.0 million. On March 2, 2015, we entered into an amendment that increased the
maximum value to $150.0 million, and on July 14, 2015, we entered into an additional amendment that increased the maximum value to $175.0 million.
Interest accrued at one-month LIBOR+1.60% per annum. We were required to cash collateralize a specified percentage of each loan included under the
TRS in accordance with margin requirements. On March 31, 2016, the TRS matured. At maturity we purchased approximately $138.9 million of the
loans that were referenced by the TRS. The majority of these loans were purchased to fund future CLOs.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are
described in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as updated in Note 2
to the unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report. These policies require numerous estimates and assumptions, which may
prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Company’s future
financial condition and results of operations. The most critical of these significant accounting policies are the policies for revenue recognition, allowance
for credit losses, income taxes, stock compensation, valuation of investments, fair value measurements used to record fair value adjustment to certain
financial instruments, determination of other than temporary impairments and temporary impairments, and impairment of goodwill and identified
intangible assets. As of the date of this report, the Company does not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of its
critical accounting policies or its estimates and assumptions from those discussed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2016.

The Company continues to evaluate and document the impacts of recently issued accounting standards, including but not limited to the revenue
recognition standard. The team established by the Company to evaluate and document the impact of the standard have completed the scoping phase and
identified three revenue streams to be in-scope under the new standard. Upon completion of the initial assessment of the three revenue streams, we
believe two of these streams will not result in any changes to revenue recognition upon adoption. The implementation team continues to assess the
potential impact, if any, of the remaining in-scope revenue stream. The Company has not yet finalized a decision regarding a transition method and does
not expect the provisions of ASU 2014-09 to result in any material changes to the timing of when revenue is recognized. The Company will adopt this
standard effective January 1, 2018.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to changes in market values of our portfolio of loans for which the fair value option was elected, loans held-for-sale, which are
carried at lower of cost or fair value, and our investment in debt securities, available-for-sale and derivatives, which are carried at fair value. Fair value
is defined as the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and for all other investments and derivatives, fair
value is determined pursuant to a valuation policy and a consistent valuation process. Where a market quotation is not readily available, we estimate fair
value using various valuation methodologies, including cash flow analysis, as well as qualitative factors.

As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, investments in debt securities available-for-sale totaled $175.8 million and $119.3 million,
respectively. At September 30, 2017, our net unrealized gain on those debt securities totaled $3.4 million and at December 31, 2016, our net unrealized
loss on debt securities totaled $6.1 million. Any unrealized gain or loss on these investments is included in Other Comprehensive Income in the equity
section of the balance sheet, until realized.

Interest rate risk represents a market risk exposure to us. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility to our net interest income caused
by changes in market interest rates.

As of September 30, 2017, substantially all of the loans in our portfolio were at variable rates and had interest rate floors. Majority of loans are
currently priced above floors. Our credit facilities and term debt securitizations all bear interest at variable rates without interest rate floors.

The presence of interest rate floors in our loan agreements results in assets with hybrid fixed and floating rate loan characteristics. Provided that
the contractual interest rate remains at or below the interest rate floor, a performing loan will typically behave as a fixed rate instrument. If contractual
interest rates are in excess of the interest rate floor, a performing loan will typically behave as a floating rate instrument. In a low interest rate
environment, floors provide a benefit as we are able to earn additional income equal to the difference between the stated rate of the interest rate floor and
the corresponding contractual rate. If interest rates rise, the potential benefit provided by interest rate floors would decrease resulting in lower net
interest income. The cost of our variable rate debt would increase, while interest income from loans with interest rate floors would not change until
interest rates exceed the stated rate of the interest rate floors or upon the re-pricing or principal repayment of the loans.

The following table shows the hypothetical estimated change in net interest income over a 12-month period based on a static, instantaneous
parallel shift in interest rates applied to our portfolio and cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2017. Our modeling is based on contractual
terms and does not consider prepayment or changes in the composition of our portfolio or our current capital structure. It further generalizes that both
variable rate assets and liabilities are indexed to a flat 3 month LIBOR yield curve. Although we believe these measurements are representative of our
interest rate sensitivity, we can give no assurance that actual results would not differ materially from our modeled outcomes.

Increase of    200    25,842 
Increase of    300    38,857 

As interest rates have risen above the floors in our loans, the Company has transitioned from being liability sensitive to asset sensitive. As of
September 30, 2017 the net gap was $1.3 billion.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

From time to time we expect to be party to legal proceedings. We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The risk factors set forth below relate to the Company’s contemplated merger with First Eagle Holdings, Inc. and its contemplated related asset
sale, and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of the Company’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

We may not be able to complete our merger with First Eagle and our asset sale to GSO. The failure to complete these transactions, or delays or
uncertainty concerning completion of these transactions, may adversely affect our business operations and financial results.

As described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, on October 16, 2017, we signed a merger agreement with First Eagle Holdings,
Inc. (“First Eagle”), FE Holdco, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Eagle (“FE Holdco”), and a newly formed wholly-owned merger subsidiary of
FE Holdco, pursuant to which we will merge with the merger subsidiary and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of FE Holdco. In a related transaction,
we also entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell a portfolio of investment assets, including approximately $2.4 billion of middle-market loans
and other credit investments, to a newly formed investment fund sponsored by GSO Capital Partners LP (the “Asset Buyer”). The closing of the merger
with First Eagle is conditioned upon, and will occur immediately following, the Asset Buyer’s completion of the acquisition of assets under the asset
purchase agreement. In addition to the closing of the asset sale, completion of the merger is subject to certain additional conditions, including the receipt
of the necessary approval of our stockholders, the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and specified client consents, and other customary closing
conditions, including the accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the agreement. In addition to stockholder approval, completion of the
asset sale is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to closing under the definitive merger agreement, the satisfaction of certain regulatory
approvals and other customary closing conditions. Many of the conditions are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain
stockholder approval or required regulatory approvals, or satisfy or obtain a waiver of the other conditions to completion of the merger or the asset sale,
in which case the merger and asset sale may not be completed. If the merger and the asset purchase transactions are not consummated, our stock price
may decline to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that such transactions will be completed.

In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated by the Company or First Eagle, and the asset purchase agreement may be terminated by the
Company or the Asset Buyer, under certain circumstances. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances (including if our
board of directors terminates the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal), we will be required to pay First Eagle and the Asset Buyer
termination fees in the aggregate of either $10 million (if the termination is made in connection with a superior proposal from a third party which
provides us with an acquisition proposal during a thirty day go-shop period) or $15 million (if the agreements are terminated under certain other
conditions).

The restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the merger and the asset sale, and the uncertainties and risks
concerning completion of these transactions, may cause our business, lending activities, operations and financial results to suffer during the pendency of
the transactions or in the event the transactions are not completed. The transaction agreements require us to conduct business in the ordinary course and
have limitations on the operations of our business, subject to specific exceptions, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking business
opportunities that, absent the merger agreement, we might have pursued. Among other restrictions, the merger agreement prohibits us from paying any
dividends other than our regular quarterly

cash dividend on our common stock payable in the fourth quarter of 2017 at a rate not in excess of $0.02 per share, and both agreements place certain
restrictions on our ability to purchase or originate new loans or increase any loan commitments or incur additional indebtedness. The announcement of
the transactions and any delay in completing the transactions may divert management’s attention from ongoing business operations, affect our ability to
retain or recruit key employees and negatively impact our business relationships with borrowers and financing sources.

We will incur costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the merger and the asset purchase
transaction, for which we will have received little or no benefit if these transactions are not completed. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by
us even if the transactions are not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the transactions.
Additionally, we may be subject to class action lawsuits initiated by shareholders or other litigation in connection with the transactions. While we will
evaluate and defend against any actions vigorously, such litigation could delay the timing for completing the transaction and the costs of the defense of
such lawsuits and other effects of such litigation could be significant.

The value of the contingent value rights that our stockholders will receive in the merger will depend, upon other things, on the amount and
timing of certain net tax refunds we expect to receive for the two taxable years prior to, and the interim period ending on, the consummation of the
transactions. If the transactions are not consummated in calendar year 2017, our stockholders are expected to receive less under their contingent
value rights than they would if the transactions close prior to year-end.

Under the merger agreement with First Eagle, our stockholders will receive $11.44 in upfront cash and one non-transferable contingent value right
(“CVR”) for each NewStar share held at the closing of the transaction. Each CVR will entitle its holder to receive pro-rata distributions of any net tax
refunds received by NewStar following the closing as a result of a carryback of NewStar’s losses generated primarily from the sale of assets to GSO, for
the two taxable years prior to, and the interim period ending on, the closing of the transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement, 30% of any
such net tax refund will be distributed to the CVR holders promptly upon receipt, with the remainder to be held in escrow. Upon approval from the
Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), 60% of any net tax refund plus any interest earned on such amount in the escrow account will be
distributed to the CVR holders, with the remainder distributed to the CVR holders upon the completion of applicable tax audits or the expiration of
applicable statutes of limitations. We currently estimate these refunds to total $1.00 per share if the transaction closes in 2017 or $0.88 per share if the
transaction closes in 2018. We expect to be able to file for these refunds by the third quarter of 2018. Actual timing of receipt and disbursement of these
tax refunds to CVR holders will depend on the timing of potential IRS audits and JCT approval and other factors not within our control. The amount of
tax refunds received will depend, among other things, on the timing of the closing of the merger, which is subject to the satisfaction of numerous
conditions, including many beyond our control.
