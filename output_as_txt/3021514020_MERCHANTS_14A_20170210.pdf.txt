TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROPOSED MERGER — YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Stockholder:

On October 22, 2016, the board of directors of Merchants Bancshares, Inc. (“Merchants”) unanimously approved an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) between Merchants and Community Bank System, Inc. (“Community Bank System”). Merchants is holding a
special meeting of stockholders on Thursday, March 23, 2017, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, at the DoubleTree by Hilton, 1117 Williston Road,
South Burlington, Vermont 05403, for its stockholders of record on February 2, 2017, to vote on the proposals necessary to complete the merger.
If Merchants stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and the merger is subsequently completed, Merchants will merge with and into
Community Bank System (the “Merger”), with Community Bank System continuing as the surviving company.

If the Merger Agreement proposal is approved and the Merger is subsequently completed, Merchants stockholders may elect to receive, in
exchange for each outstanding share of Merchants common stock they hold, either: (i) $40.00 in cash (which we refer to as the “cash election
consideration”); (ii) 0.9630 shares of common stock of Community Bank System (which we refer to as the “stock election consideration”); or (iii)
a combination of $12.00 in cash and 0.6741 shares of common stock of Community Bank System (which we refer to as the “mixed election
consideration”). Both the cash election consideration and the stock election consideration are subject to proration and adjustment procedures to
ensure that the total amount of cash paid, and the total number of shares of Community Bank System common stock issued, in the Merger to
Merchants stockholders, as a whole, will equal as nearly as practicable the total amount of cash and number of shares that would have been paid
and issued if all of the Merchants stockholders received the mixed election consideration. Merchants stockholders who fail to make a timely
election or who make no election will receive the mixed election consideration. For more information, see “Proposal I — The Merger” and “The
Merger Agreement.”

The precise consideration that Merchants stockholders will receive if they elect the cash election consideration or the stock election
consideration will not be known at the time that Merchants stockholders vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement or make an election
as to the type of consideration that they would like to receive in the Merger. On October 21, 2016, which was the last trading date on the New
York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) preceding the public announcement of the Merger, the closing price of Community Bank System common stock
was $47.50 per share, valuing the mixed election consideration at approximately $44.02 per share. On February 2, 2017, the most recent
practicable date prior to the mailing of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the closing price of Community Bank System common stock on the
NYSE was $57.67, valuing the mixed election consideration at approximately $50.88 per share. Based on 6,898,903 shares of Merchants common
stock issued and outstanding, Community Bank System expects to issue in the Merger approximately 4,650,551 shares of its common stock
before taking into account any adjustment for the issuance of cash in lieu of fractional shares.

The market prices of Community Bank System common stock and Merchants common stock will fluctuate before the completion of the
Merger. You should obtain current stock price quotations for Community Bank System and Merchants common stock before you vote.
Community Bank System common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “CBU.” Merchants common stock is traded on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “MBVT.”

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, in the event that the volume-weighted average trading price of Community Bank System common
stock for a specified period prior to the closing is less than $35.77 per share and the decrease in the price of Community Bank System’s common
stock is more than 20% greater than the decrease in the SNL Midcap U.S. Bank Index over the same period, Merchants has the right to terminate
the Merger Agreement, Community Bank System has the option to increase the amount of Community Bank System common stock issuable to
Merchants stockholders by a formula-based amount set forth in the Merger Agreement to prevent such termination.

The Merchants board of directors has unanimously determined that the Merger and the Merger Agreement are advisable and in the
best interests of Merchants and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, “FOR” approval, on an advisory basis, of the Merger-related executive compensation payable to the Merchants named
executive officers in connection with the Merger, and “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Merchants special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

The Merger cannot be completed unless at least two-thirds of the issued and outstanding shares of Merchants common stock entitled
to vote at the special meeting vote in favor of the Merger. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting of stockholders, please
take the time to vote by using the Internet, by telephone or by completing the enclosed proxy card and mailing it in the enclosed envelope.
If you sign, date and mail your proxy card without indicating how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote “FOR” each of
the proposals being voted on at Merchants’ special meeting. If you fail to vote, or you do not instruct your broker how to vote any shares
held for you in “street name,” it will have same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement, but it will have no impact on the
advisory, non-binding proposal to approve the Merger-related executive compensation or the proposal to approve an adjournment of the
special meeting.

The accompanying document is being delivered to Merchants stockholders as Community Bank System’s Prospectus for its offering of
Community Bank System common stock in connection with the Merger, and as Merchants’ Proxy Statement for the solicitation of proxies for the
special meeting.

Burlington, Vermont 05403, to consider and vote upon the following matters:

1. a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 22, 2016, by and between Community Bank
System, Inc. (“Community Bank System”) and Merchants (the “Merger Agreement), which provides for the merger of
Merchants with and into Community Bank System with Community Bank System as the surviving company (the “Merger”);

2. a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the compensation payable to the named executive officers of Merchants in
connection with the Merger (the “Merger-Related Executive Compensation”);

3. a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement (the “adjournment
proposal”); and

4. any other business which may properly come before the special meeting or any adjournment thereof.

The Merger is described in more detail in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which you should read carefully in its entirety
before you vote. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Only holders of
record of Merchants common stock at the close of business on February 2, 2017 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special
meeting and any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting.

Under Delaware law, Merchants stockholders who do not vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement will have
the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their Merchants common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery if the Merger is completed, but only if they submit a written demand for such an appraisal prior to the vote on
adoption of the Merger Agreement and strictly comply with the other Delaware law procedures explained in this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. See the section entitled “Proposal I — The Merger — Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on
page 58. The applicable Delaware law is reproduced in its entirety in Annex C to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Please vote as soon as possible. The affirmative vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Merchants common stock
entitled to vote at the special meeting of stockholders is required for the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Approval of the
non-binding, advisory Merger-Related Executive Compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast on the proposal. Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
cast on the proposal.

If you fail to vote, or you do not instruct your broker how to vote any shares held for you in “street name,” it will have
same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

The following are answers to certain questions that you may have regarding the merger and the special meeting. We urge you to
read carefully the remainder of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus because the information in this section may not provide all the
information that might be important to you in determining how to vote. Additional important information is also contained in the
annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference in, this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Q: Why am I receiving this document?

A: Community Bank System, Inc. (“Community Bank System”) and Merchants Bancshares, Inc. (“Merchants”) have agreed to
combine under the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between Community Bank System and Merchants,
dated as of October 22, 2016 (the “Merger Agreement”), that is described in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. A copy of the
Merger Agreement is attached to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus as Annex A. In order to complete the merger of
Merchants with and into Community Bank System (the “Merger”), the stockholders of Merchants must vote to adopt the
Merger Agreement. Merchants will hold a special meeting of its stockholders to solicit this approval, as well as the non-
binding advisory approval of the Merger-Related Executive Compensation and, if necessary, the approval of the
adjournment proposal.

We are delivering this Proxy Statement/Prospectus to you as both a Proxy Statement of Merchants and a Prospectus of
Community Bank System. It is a Proxy Statement because the Merchants board of directors is soliciting proxies from its
stockholders. It is a Prospectus because Community Bank System will issue Community Bank System common stock to the
Merchants stockholders who receive stock consideration in the Merger, and this Prospectus contains information about
Community Bank System common stock. This Proxy Statement/Prospectus contains important information about the
Merger, the Merger Agreement, the special meeting of Merchants stockholders, and other related matters, and we encourage
you to read it carefully.

Q: What will happen to Merchants as a result of the Merger?

A: If the Merger is completed, Merchants will cease to exist and Merchants Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Merchants,
will become a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Community Bank System. Immediately following completion of the
Merger, Merchants Bank will then merge with and into Community Bank, N.A. (“Community Bank”), the wholly-owned
subsidiary of Community Bank System, with Community Bank being the surviving bank.

Q: Who is being asked to approve matters in connection with the Merger?

A: Only Merchants stockholders are being asked to vote to approve the Merger-related proposals. Community Bank System is
not required to obtain Community Bank System stockholder approval of the Merger or the Merger Agreement.

Q: What will I receive in the Merger?

A: If the Merger Agreement proposal is approved and the Merger is subsequently completed, each outstanding share of
Merchants common stock will be converted into the right to receive either:

• $40.00 in cash, without interest (the “cash election consideration”);

• 0.9630 shares of Community Bank System common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares (the “stock election
consideration”); or

• a combination of both $12.00 in cash and 0.6741 shares of Community Bank System common stock, plus cash in lieu of
fractional shares (the “mixed election consideration”).

The above consideration is subject to proration procedures that are designed to ensure that the total amount of cash paid,
and the total number of shares of Community Bank System common stock issued, in the Merger will equal as nearly as
practicable the total amount of cash and number of shares that would have been paid and issued if all of the Merchants
stockholders received the mixed election consideration.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

You may elect to receive the cash election consideration, the stock election consideration, or the mixed election
consideration. However, the ability to receive the consideration of your choice will depend on the elections of other
Merchants stockholders. The proration of the consideration payable to Merchants stockholders in the Merger will not be
known until Community Bank System tallies the results of the elections made by Merchants stockholders, which will not
occur until near or after the closing of the Merger.

Q: Will I receive the form of consideration that I elect?

A: If you elect to receive the mixed election consideration, you will receive the mixed election consideration. If you elect to
receive the cash election consideration or stock election consideration, you may not receive the exact form of consideration
that you elect. If you make no election with respect to your shares of Merchants common stock (and do not exercise
appraisal rights), you will receive the mixed election consideration.

It is currently estimated that, if the Merger is completed, Community Bank System will issue, in the aggregate,
approximately 4.65 million shares of Community Bank System common stock and pay approximately $82.78 million in
cash to Merchants stockholders. Under the proration procedures in the Merger Agreement, the total amount of cash paid,
and the total number of shares of Community Bank System common stock issued, in the Merger to the holders of shares of
Merchants common stock (other than excluded shares), as a whole, will equal as nearly as practicable the total amount of
cash and number of shares that would have been paid and issued if all of such shares of Merchants common stock were
converted into the mixed election consideration.

Whether you receive the amount of cash and/or stock you request in your election form will depend in part on the elections
of other Merchants stockholders. You may not receive the form of consideration that you elect in the Merger, and you may
instead receive a pro-rata amount of cash and/or Community Bank System common stock.

The greater the oversubscription of the stock election consideration, the less stock and more cash a Merchants stockholder
making the stock election will receive. Reciprocally, the greater the oversubscription of the cash election consideration, the
less cash and more stock a Merchants stockholder making the cash election will receive. However, in no event will a
Merchants stockholder who makes the cash election or the stock election receive less cash and more shares of Community
Bank System common stock, or fewer shares of Community Bank System common stock and more cash, respectively, than
a stockholder who elects the mixed election consideration. See “The Merger Agreement — Election and Proration
Procedures” beginning on page 63 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

The proration of the consideration payable to Merchants stockholders who elect to receive the cash election consideration
and/or the stock election consideration will not be known until Community Bank System tallies the results of the elections,
which will not occur until near or after the closing of the Merger.

Q: How will Merchants stock options be treated in the Merger?

A: Each Merchants stock option outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, whether or
not then vested or exercisable, will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to
the aggregate number of Merchants shares subject to such option multiplied by the excess of the value of the mixed election
consideration over the exercise price of such option.

Q: How will shares of Merchants common stock subject to vesting or forfeiture restrictions be treated in the Merger?

Each share of Merchants common stock subject to vesting or forfeiture restrictions and granted under any Merchants benefit
plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether or not then vested, will automatically vest in full,
and any restrictions thereon will lapse, and such

TABLE OF CONTENTS

stock will be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the value of the mixed election consideration
plus dividends, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the effective time with respect to such restricted share.

Q: How will warrants to purchase Merchants common stock be treated in the Merger?

A: Each warrant that was originally issued on April 25, 2008 by NUVO Bank & Trust Company (with respect to which
Merchants issued replacement warrants on December 4, 2015), which we refer to as “organizers’ warrants,” to purchase

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: When is the Merger expected to be completed?

A: The parties are working to complete the Merger during late second quarter or early third quarter of 2017. Merchants and
Community Bank System must first obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and the approval of the Merchants
stockholders at the special meeting and satisfy other customary closing conditions. Merchants and Community Bank System
cannot assure you as to when or if all the conditions to the Merger will be met, and it is possible that the parties will not
complete the Merger at all.

Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?

A: If the Merger is not completed, Merchants will remain an independent company. If the Merger Agreement is terminated
under certain specified circumstances, Merchants may be required to pay to Community Bank System a termination fee of
$10.72 million.

Q: Does the board of directors of Merchants have a recommendation on how I should vote on the Merger Agreement?

A: Yes. The board of directors of Merchants unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the Merger are advisable
and in the best interests of Merchants and its stockholders, and unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Merchants
vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

Q: Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the Merger-Related Executive Compensation?

A: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), adopted rules that require Merchants to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect
to certain payments that will or may be made to Merchants’ named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Q: What will happen if Merchants stockholders do not approve the Merger-Related Executive Compensation proposal
at the special meeting?

A: Approval of the proposal related to the Merger-Related Executive Compensation is not a condition to completing the
Merger. The vote with respect to the Merger-Related Executive Compensation is an advisory vote and will not be binding on
Merchants regardless of whether the Merger Agreement is adopted. Accordingly, as the compensation to be paid to the
Merchants executives in connection with the Merger is contractual, such compensation will or may be payable if the Merger
is completed regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

Q: Are there any stockholders already committed to voting in favor of the Merger Agreement?

A: Yes. All of the directors of Merchants and another principal stockholder of Merchants have entered into voting agreements
with Community Bank System requiring them to vote all of their shares in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. As of
the record date for the special meeting, these stockholders held approximately 11% of the outstanding shares of Merchants
common stock.

Q: What risks should I consider before I vote on the Merger and make my election as to the form of merger
consideration?

A: You should read and carefully consider the risk factors set forth in section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 15 of
this Proxy Statement/Prospectus as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, including the matters addressed in the section of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus titled “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 21.

Q: Is there other information I should consider?

A: Yes. Much of the business and financial information about each of the companies that may be important to you is not
included in this document. Instead, that information is incorporated by

and Community Bank System can satisfy their disclosure obligations to you by referring you to one or more documents
separately filed by Community Bank System or Merchants with the SEC. Please see “Where You Can Find More
Information” beginning on page 104 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus, for a list of documents that they have incorporated
by reference into this document and for instructions on how to obtain copies of those documents, free of charge.

Q: When and where will Merchants stockholders meet?

A: Merchants will hold a special meeting of its stockholders on Thursday, March 23, 2017, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, at the
DoubleTree by Hilton, 1117 Williston Road, South Burlington, Vermont 05403.

Q: Who can vote at the Merchants special meeting?

A: Holders of record of Merchants common stock at the close of business on February2, 2017, which is the record date for the
Merchants special meeting, are entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Q: How many votes must be represented in person or by proxy at the Merchants special meeting to have a quorum?

A: A majority of the shares of Merchants common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in
person or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum at the special meeting.

Q: What vote by Merchants stockholders is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?

A: Assuming a quorum is present at the Merchants special meeting, adoption of the Merger Agreement will require the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Merchants common stock entitled to vote.
Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as shares voted “AGAINST” adoption of the Merger Agreement,
but they will have no impact on the advisory, non-binding proposal to approve the Merger-Related Executive Compensation
or the proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting.

Q: What do I need to do now?

A: After you have carefully read and considered the information contained or incorporated by reference into this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, please vote your shares promptly. If you hold common stock in your name as a stockholder of record,
please complete, sign, date and mail your proxy card in the enclosed postage paid return envelope as soon as possible. You
may also vote by telephone or through the Internet as instructed on the enclosed proxy card. If you hold your shares in
“street name” through a bank, broker or other fiduciary, you must direct your bank or broker to vote in accordance with the
instructions you receive from your bank, broker or other fiduciary.

If you sign and send in your proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of the
Merger Agreement, the approval, on an advisory basis, of the Merger-Related Executive Compensation, and, if necessary,
the adjournment proposal.

Q: If my shares are held in “street name” by my broker, will the broker vote my shares for me?

A: No. Your broker WILL NOT vote your shares unless you provide instructions on how to vote. It is important that you
provide timely instruction to your broker or bank to ensure that all shares of Merchants common stock that you own are
voted at the special meeting. You should instruct your broker how to vote your shares, following the directions your broker
provides.

Q: What if I fail to instruct my broker?

A: If you do not provide your broker with instructions and your broker submits an unvoted proxy, referred to as a “broker non-
vote,” the broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Broker non-
votes will have no impact on the advisory, non-binding proposal to approve the Merger-Related Executive Compensation or
the proposal to approve an adjournment of the special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: Can I attend the special meeting and vote my shares in person?

A: Yes. Although the Merchants board of directors requests that you vote your shares by mail, by telephone, or through the
Internet in advance of the special meeting, all Merchants stockholders are invited to attend the special meeting. Stockholders
of record on February 2, 2017 may vote in person at the special meeting. If your shares are held by a broker, bank or other
nominee, then you are not the stockholder of record and you must bring to the special meeting appropriate documentation
from your broker, bank or other nominee to enable you to vote at the special meeting.

Q: Can I change my vote?

A: Yes. If you do not hold your shares in “street name,” there are three ways you can change your vote at any time after you
have sent in your proxy card and before your proxy is voted at the special meeting: (i) you may give written notice of
revocation to Merchants’ corporate secretary; (ii) you may submit a new signed proxy card bearing a later date or vote again
by telephone or the Internet (any earlier proxies will be automatically revoked); or (iii) you may attend the special meeting
and vote in person (however, the mere presence of a stockholder at the special meeting will not constitute revocation of a
previously given proxy). If you hold your shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other fiduciary, you should
contact your bank, broker or other fiduciary to revoke your proxy.

Any written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to revocation of proxies should be addressed to
Merchants as follows: Merchants Bancshares, Inc., Corporate Secretary, 275 Kennedy Drive, South Burlington, Vermont,
05403, which must be received by 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on March 22, 2017.

Q: How do I make an election as to the form of merger consideration I wish to receive in the Merger?

A: Community Bank System will mail to each Merchants stockholder an election form/letter of transmittal which will contain
instructions for making a selection of merger consideration and for surrendering your stock certificates in exchange for the
merger consideration. American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“American Stock Transfer”), the exchange agent for the
Merger, must receive your properly completed election form/letter of transmittal and your stock certificates, or suitable
guarantee of delivery, by no later than the election deadline in order for your choice as to the form of merger consideration to
be considered with those made by the other Merchants stockholders. Merchants and Community Bank System will notify
you of the election deadline.

Q: What happens if I don’t make a valid election as to the form of merger consideration before the election deadline?

A: If you do not make a valid election as to the form of merger consideration before the election deadline, each share of
Merchants common stock held by you will be converted into the right to receive a combination of $12.00 in cash and 0.6741
shares of Community Bank System common stock. If the Merger is completed, the exchange agent will send any
stockholder who does not make a valid election a new letter of transmittal that such stockholder can use to surrender his or
her shares of Merchants common stock in exchange for the merger consideration.

Q: Can I change my election as to the form of merger consideration?

A: Yes. You can change your election as to the form of merger consideration by submitting a new election form/letter of
transmittal. For a change to be effective, the exchange agent must receive your election form/letter of transmittal before the
election deadline.

Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to me?

A: It is a condition to the obligation of Merchants to complete the Merger that Merchants receives a legal opinion to the effect
that the Merger qualifies as “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, as
amended, which we refer to as the “Code”. If, as

TABLE OF CONTENTS

expected, the Merger qualifies as a “reorganization”, the specific tax consequences to a U.S. holder (as defined in “Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 54 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus)
exchanging Merchants common stock in the Merger will generally depend upon the form of consideration such U.S. holder
receives in the Merger.

• A U.S. holder exchanging all of its shares of Merchants common stock for solely Community Bank System common
stock (and cash instead of fractional shares of Community Bank System common stock) pursuant to the Merger
Agreement will generally not recognize gain or loss, except with respect to cash received instead of fractional shares of
Community Bank System common stock.

• A U.S. holder exchanging all of its shares of Merchants common stock for solely cash pursuant to the Merger
Agreement will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash it receives and its
cost basis in its Merchants common stock.

• A U.S. holder exchanging all of its shares of Merchants common stock for a combination of Community Bank System
common stock and cash pursuant to the Merger Agreement will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of cash treated as received in exchange for Merchants common stock in the Merger
and (ii) the excess of the “amount realized” in the transaction (i.e., the fair market value of the Community Bank System
common stock at the effective time of the Merger plus the amount of cash treated as received in exchange for Merchants
common stock in the Merger) over its tax basis in its surrendered Merchants common stock.

The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of Merchants common stock.
Your tax consequences will depend on your individual situation. Accordingly, we strongly urge you to consult your
own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences of the Merger to you.

Q: Are Merchants stockholders entitled to seek appraisal or dissenters’ rights if they do not vote in favor of the adoption
of the Merger Agreement?

A: Yes. As a holder of Merchants common stock, you are entitled to seek appraisal or dissenters’ rights under the Delaware
General Corporation Law in connection with the Merger. Failure to follow precisely any of the statutory requirements could
result in the loss of your appraisal rights.

Q: Should Merchants stockholders send in their stock certificates with the enclosed proxy?

A: No. Merchants stockholders SHOULD NOT send in any stock certificates now. You will receive separate written
instructions for making your election and surrendering your shares of Merchants common stock.

adopt the Merger Agreement, a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the Merger-Related Executive Compensation, and if
necessary, the adjournment proposal.

Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Shares Entitled to Vote (Page 24)

Only holders of record of Merchants common stock at the close of business on the record date of February 2, 2017 are entitled
to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. As of the record date, there were 6,898,903 shares of Merchants common stock
outstanding, held of record by approximately 856 stockholders.

The adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of
Merchants common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting of stockholders. Approval of the Merger-Related Executive
Compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Approval of the adjournment
proposal, if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement, requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal.

the other Delaware law procedures explained in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. See the section entitled “Proposal 1 — The
Merger — Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 58 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The applicable Delaware law
is reproduced in its entirety in Annex C to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

The Merger

Structure of the Merger (Page 62)

Merchants and Community Bank System are proposing a merger of Merchants with and into Community Bank System, with
Community Bank System as the surviving company. Immediately following the Merger, the parties will merge Merchants Bank, a
wholly-owned banking subsidiary of Merchants, with and into Community Bank, a wholly-owned banking subsidiary of
Community Bank System, with Community Bank as the surviving entity (the “Bank Merger”).

The Merger Agreement is attached to this document as Annex A. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully
and in its entirety as it is the legal document that governs the Merger and your rights in it. You are also encouraged to read the risk
factors beginning on page 15.

Merger Consideration (Page 62)

If the Merger proposal is approved and the Merger is subsequently completed, you may elect to receive (subject to the proration
procedures described below), in exchange for each outstanding share of Merchants common stock that you own, either:

• $40.00 in cash, without interest (the “cash election consideration”);

• 0.9630 shares of Community Bank System common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares (the “stock election
consideration”); or

• a combination of 0.6741 shares of Community Bank System common stock and $12.00 in cash, plus cash in lieu of
fractional shares (the “mixed election consideration”).

Election Procedures (Page 63)

Community Bank System will mail separately an election form/letter of transmittal. Please read the instructions to the election
form/letter of transmittal, and complete, sign and return it with your Merchants stock certificates or appropriate guarantee of
delivery before the election deadline. Merchants and Community Bank System will notify you of the election deadline. If you do
not make a valid election as to the form of merger consideration before the election deadline, all of your shares of Merchants
common stock will be converted into the right to receive the mixed election consideration.

Proration Procedures (Page 63)

The merger consideration to be paid to Merchants stockholders is subject to allocation procedures that are designed to ensure
that the total amount of cash paid, and the total number of shares of Community Bank System common stock issued in the Merger,
as a whole, will equal as nearly as practicable the total amount of cash and number of shares that would have been paid and issued
if all of the Merchants stockholders received the mixed election consideration.

Whether you receive the amount of cash and/or stock you request in your election form will depend in part on the elections of
other Merchants stockholders. You may not receive the form of consideration that you elect in the Merger, and you may instead
receive a pro-rata amount of cash and/or Community Bank System common stock.

The greater the oversubscription of the stock election, the less stock and more cash a Merchants stockholder making the stock
election will receive. Reciprocally, the greater the oversubscription of the cash election, the less cash and more stock a Merchants
stockholder making the cash election will receive. However, in no event will a Merchants stockholder who makes the cash election
or the stock election receive less cash and more shares of Community Bank System common stock, or fewer shares of Community
Bank System common stock and more cash, respectively, than a stockholder who makes the mixed election.

beginning on page 63 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Treatment of Merchants Equity Awards and Warrants (Page 67)

At the effective time of the Merger, each option granted under Merchants’ equity plans outstanding and unexercised, whether or
not then vested or exercisable, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the
product of the number of shares of Merchants common stock underlying the option and the excess of the value of the mixed
election consideration over the exercise price of the option.

At the effective time of the Merger, each restricted stock award granted under Merchants’ equity plans will automatically vest
in full, and any restrictions thereon will lapse, and such stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash
payment equal to the value of the mixed election consideration, plus all dividends, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the effective
time of the Merger with respect to such restricted share.

At the effective time of the Merger, each organizers’ warrant will be converted into a warrant to acquire, upon payment of the
amount determined by dividing the per share exercise price immediately prior to the effective time by the stock election
consideration of 0.9630, the number of shares of Community Bank System common stock determined by multiplying (i) the
number of shares of Merchants common stock which may be acquired upon exercise of such organizers’ warrant immediately prior
to the effective time by (ii) the stock election consideration of 0.9630.

At the effective time of the Merger, each 2013 warrant will be converted into the right to receive, at the holder’s election, either
(i) a cash payment in cancellation of such 2013 warrant equal to the number of shares of Merchants common stock which may be
acquired upon exercise of such 2013 warrant multiplied by the excess, if any, of the cash election consideration of $40.00 over the
per share 2013 warrant exercise price immediately prior to the effective time or (ii) a replacement 2013 warrant certificate issued
by Community Bank System representing the right to acquire prior to the expiration date of the original 2013 warrant, upon
payment of the amount determined by dividing the per share exercise price immediately prior to the effective time by the stock
election consideration of 0.9630, that number of shares of Community Bank System common stock equal to the number of shares
of Merchants common stock which may be acquired upon exercise of such 2013 warrant immediately prior to the effective time
multiplied by the stock election consideration of 0.9630.

Opinion of Merchants’ Financial Advisor (Page 38)

In connection with the Merger, Merchants’ financial advisor, Piper Jaffray & Co. (“Piper”), delivered a written opinion to the
Merchants board of directors, dated October 22, 2016, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various factors,
assumptions and limitations set forth in its opinion, the consideration offered in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view,
to the holders of Merchants common stock. The full text of Piper’s written opinion dated October 22, 2016, which sets forth,
among other things, the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope
of review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus and is incorporated herein
by reference. Piper’s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Merchants board of
directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the fairness of the merger consideration from a
financial point of view, and did not address any other aspects or implications of the Merger. The opinion does not constitute
a recommendation to the Merchants board of directors or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how
any holder of Merchants common stock should vote at any stockholders’ meeting held in connection with the Merger or
take, or not to take, any action in respect of the Merger. Piper’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger
as compared to any other business or financial strategies that might be available to Merchants, nor does it address the
underlying business decision of Merchants to engage in the Merger.

to be true and correct as of the effective time of the Merger (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the Merger
Agreement);

• Merchants and Community Bank System having complied with all of their respective covenants pursuant to the Merger
Agreement in all material respects;

• the NYSE approving for listing the Community Bank System common stock to be issued in the Merger;

opinion to Community Bank System, dated as of the closing date of the Merger, to the effect that the Merger will qualify as
a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code;

• Goodwin Procter LLP (“Goodwin Procter”), Merchants’ outside legal counsel, delivering an opinion to Merchants, dated as
of the closing date of the Merger, to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Code; and

Fees and Expenses; Termination Fee (Page 80)

Merchants and Community Bank System will each pay its own expenses in connection with the Merger, except that the parties
will share equally all costs associated with the printing and mailing of this document. If, however, the Merger Agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances, Merchants must pay a termination fee of $10.72 million as set forth in the Merger
Agreement. Generally, the termination fee will become payable in connection with Merchants accepting a competing third party
acquisition offer.

Terminating the Merger Agreement (Page 78)

Either Merchants or Community Bank System may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including if:

• both companies consent in writing to the termination;

• the Merger is not completed by July 22, 2017; however, neither party has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement if
such party was in breach of its obligations under the Merger Agreement and such breach was the cause of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated by such date (if on such expiration date all conditions to the Merger have been satisfied or
waived or are capable of being satisfied by the closing other than the condition relating to the receipt of required regulatory
approvals, then either party has the right to extend the expiration date by an additional three month period);

• any governmental entity issues a final order prohibiting the completion of the Merger;

• Merchants stockholders do not approve the Merger Agreement at the special meeting; and

• the other party materially breaches, and does not cure within 30 days of notice of such breach from the other party, any of
the representations, warranties or covenants it has made under the Merger Agreement, which would constitute a failure of a
condition to closing of such breaching party.

Merchants may terminate the Merger Agreement (i) if Community Bank System’s stock price falls below thresholds set forth in
the Merger Agreement and Community Bank System does not increase the stock consideration in the Merger pursuant to a
prescribed formula in the Merger Agreement, or (ii) in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a “superior
proposal,” as defined in the Merger Agreement, subject to payment of a $10.72 million termination fee to Community Bank
System.

Community Bank System may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merchants board of directors effects an adverse
recommendation change (i.e., (i) withdrawing, modifying or qualifying in a manner adverse to Community Bank System the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Merchants board of directors set forth in this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus that the Merchants stockholders vote to adopt

the Merger Agreement, (ii) recommending, endorsing or otherwise declaring as advisable the adoption of any acquisition proposal,
(iii) resolving, agreeing or proposing to take any such actions or (iv) submitting the Merger Agreement to Merchants stockholders
without recommendation).

Community Bank System may terminate the Merger Agreement if any governmental authority has denied or rescinded any
required regulatory approval or imposed a materially burdensome regulatory condition on Community Bank System in connection
with granting any regulatory approval.

Termination Fee (Page 80)

Merchants will owe Community Bank System a $10.72 million termination fee if:

• (i)(a) either party terminates the Merger Agreement in the event that approval by the stockholders of Merchants is not
obtained at the Merchants special meeting or in the event that the Merger is not consummated by the expiration date; or (b)
Community Bank System terminates the Merger Agreement as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement by Merchants that cannot or has not been cured within 30 days of notice of such breach; (ii) a third
party acquisition proposal has been made prior to such termination; and (iii) within 12 months of such termination,
Merchants enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal or consummates an acquisition
proposal; or

• Community Bank System terminates the Merger Agreement as a result of the Merchants board of directors or any
committee thereof effecting an adverse recommendation change; or

• Community Bank System terminates the Merger Agreement as a result of Merchants’ failure to comply in all material
respects with its obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to third party acquisition proposals or its failure to
call, give notice of, convene and hold the special meeting; or

• Community Bank System terminates the Merger Agreement as a result of (i) a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or
more of the outstanding shares of Merchants common stock being commenced and Merchants not providing to its
stockholders, within ten business days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, a statement that the
Merchants board of directors recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer, or (ii) an acquisition proposal (other
than a tender or exchange offer covered by clause (i) above) with respect to Merchants being publicly announced and, upon

Interests of Merchants Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (Page 48)

Merchants’ stockholders should be aware that some of Merchants’ directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger
and have arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of Merchants stockholders in general. These interests
include:

• Election of two Merchants directors to the boards of directors of Community Bank System and Community Bank upon the
consummation of the Merger.

• The acceleration of vesting of all unvested equity awards, which will automatically vest in full, with any restrictions thereon
to lapse, and will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment.

• Payment with respect to outstanding stock options held by a director.

• Payment of retention incentives to executive officers.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• Payment of severance benefits under existing employment agreements with Merchants’ executive officers, assuming each
executive officer has a qualifying termination event in connection with the Merger.

• New employment agreements between certain executive officers of Merchants and Community Bank System that will
become effective upon the closing of the Merger, that, among other things, entitle each such executive to receive a cash
bonus as of the effective time of the Merger and include a waiver of the executive’s rights under his or her existing
employment agreement with Merchants and an agreement to certain non-competition and non-solicitation covenants.

• Payment of a pro-rata bonus to certain executive officers at the effective time of the Merger in a lump sum under the
Merchants and Merchants Bank non-equity incentive plans.

• Continued indemnification and liability insurance coverage for directors and executive officers with respect to acts or
omissions occurring before the Merger.

The Merchants board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them in recommending that Merchants
stockholders approve the Merger Agreement.

Differences Between Rights of Holders of Community Bank System and Merchants Stock (Page 96)

Both Merchants and Community Bank System are Delaware corporations. The rights of Merchants stockholders are currently
governed by Merchants’ certificate of incorporation and bylaws. If the Merger is completed, certain Merchants stockholders will
become stockholders of Community Bank System and their rights will be governed by Community Bank System’s certificate of
incorporation and bylaws. Merchants stockholders will have different rights when they become holders of Community Bank
System common stock than they currently have as holders of Merchants common stock.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 54)

It is a condition to the respective obligations of Merchants and Community Bank System to complete the Merger that each of
Merchants and Community Bank System receives a legal opinion to the effect that the Merger qualifies as a “reorganization” within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. If, as expected, the Merger qualifies as a “reorganization”, the specific tax
consequences to a U.S. holder (as defined in “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page
54 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus) exchanging Merchants common stock in the Merger will generally depend upon the form of
consideration such U.S. holder receives in the Merger.

• A U.S. holder exchanging all of its shares of Merchants common stock for solely Community Bank System common stock
(and cash instead of fractional shares of Community Bank System common stock) pursuant to the Merger Agreement will
generally not recognize gain or loss, except with respect to cash received instead of fractional shares of Community Bank
System common stock.

• A U.S. holder exchanging all of its shares of Merchants common stock for solely cash pursuant to the Merger Agreement
will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash it receives and its cost basis in its
Merchants common stock.

• A U.S. holder exchanging all of its shares of Merchants common stock for a combination of Community Bank System
common stock and cash pursuant to the Merger Agreement will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal
to the lesser of (i) the amount of cash treated as received in exchange for Merchants common stock in the Merger and (ii)
the excess of the “amount realized” in the transaction (i.e., the fair market value of the Community Bank System common
stock at the effective time of the Merger plus the amount of cash treated as received in exchange for Merchants common
stock in the Merger) over its tax basis in its surrendered Merchants common stock.

The U.S. federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of Merchants common stock.
Your tax consequences will depend on your individual situation. Accordingly, we strongly urge you to consult your own tax
advisor to determine the particular tax consequences of the Merger to you.

(1) The tangible book value per share and the tangible equity to tangible asset ratio excludes goodwill and identifiable intangible
assets, adjusted for deferred tax liabilities generated from tax deductible goodwill. The ratio is not a financial measurement
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. However, management believes such
information is useful in analyzing the relative strength of Community Bank System’s capital position and in evaluating its
performance.

(2) Efficiency ratio provides a ratio of operating expenses to operating income. It excludes intangible amortization, goodwill
impairment, acquisition expenses, litigation settlement and contract termination charges from expenses and gains and losses on
investment securities and early retirement of long-term borrowings from income while adding a fully-taxable equivalent
adjustment. The efficiency ratio is not a financial measurement required by accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. However, the efficiency ratio is used by management in assessing financial performance specifically
as it relates to noninterest expense control. Management also believes such information is useful to investors in evaluating
Community Bank System’s performance.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following table shows unaudited pro forma financial information about the financial condition and results of operations,
including per share data, after giving effect to the Merger and other pro forma adjustments. The unaudited pro forma financial
information assumes that the Merger is accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, and
that the assets and liabilities of Merchants will be recorded by Community Bank System at their respective fair values as of the date
the Merger is completed. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the transactions as if the
transactions had occurred on September 30, 2016. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, and the year ended December 31, 2015, give effect to the transactions as if the transactions had
become effective at January 1, 2015. The unaudited selected pro forma combined financial information has been derived from and
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of Community Bank System, which are
incorporated in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus by reference, the consolidated financial statements and related notes of Merchants,
which are incorporated in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus by reference, and the more detailed unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. See “Where
You Can Find More Information” on page 104 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus and “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Condensed Consolidated Financial Information” beginning on page 81.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not
indicate the financial results of the combined company had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of each period
presented, nor the impact of possible business model changes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
also does not consider any potential effects of changes in market conditions on revenues, expense efficiencies, asset dispositions,
and share repurchases, among other factors, including those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 15
of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. In addition, as explained in more detail in the accompanying notes to the “Unaudited Pro
Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Information” beginning on page 81 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the
preliminary allocation of the pro forma purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information is subject to adjustment and may vary significantly from the actual purchase price allocation that will be recorded upon
completion of the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPARATIVE UNAUDITED PER SHARE DATA

The following table summarizes the per share information for Community Bank System and Merchants on a historical, pro
forma and equivalent basis. The pro forma and pro forma per equivalent share information gives effect to the Merger as if the
Merger had been effective on the date presented in the case of the book value data, and as if the Merger had been effective as of the
beginning of each period presented in the case of the earnings per share and the cash dividends data. As described elsewhere in this
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the stock consideration may be adjusted in the event Merchants invokes its right to terminate the
Merger Agreement if the average closing price of Community Bank System common stock for a specified period prior to closing is
less than $35.77 and Community Bank System common stock underperforms a specified peer-group index by more than 20%, and
Community Bank System elects to increase the stock consideration, in order that the Merger Agreement will not be terminated.

The pro forma information, while helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of
assumptions, does not reflect the impact of factors that may result as a consequence of the Merger or consider any potential impacts
of current market conditions or the Merger on revenues, expense efficiencies, asset dispositions, and share repurchases, among
other factors, nor the impact of possible business model changes. As a result, the pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of
what would have occurred had the Merger taken place on the assumed dates, nor do they represent an attempt to predict or suggest
future results. You should read the information in the following table in conjunction with the historical financial information and
related notes contained in the annual, quarterly and other reports filed by Community Bank System or Merchants with the SEC. See
“Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 104 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. You should not rely on the
pro forma information as being indicative of the results that Community Bank System will achieve in the Merger. The information
below should be read in conjunction with “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Information”
beginning on page 81 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

(1) The pro forma combined basic earnings and diluted earnings of Community Bank System common stock is based on the pro
forma combined net income for Community Bank System and Merchants divided by total pro forma common shares or diluted
common shares of the combined entities. The pro forma information includes adjustments related to the fair value of assets and
liabilities and is subject to adjustment as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed.
The pro forma information does not include transactional costs or anticipated cost savings or adjustments related to the fair
value of assets and liabilities.

(2) The pro forma combined book value of Community Bank System common stock is based on the pro forma combined common
stockholders’ equity of Community Bank System and Merchants divided by total pro forma common shares of the combined
entities. The pro forma information does not include transactional costs or anticipated cost savings or adjustments related to the
fair value of assets and liabilities.

(3) Cash dividend amounts are the same as historical because no change in dividend policy is expected as a result of the Merger.

(4) The Merchants equivalent is calculated by multiplying the amounts in the Combined Company column times the 0.9630
exchange ratio, which represents the number of shares of Community Bank System common stock Merchants stockholders who
make a stock election will receive for each share of Merchants common stock owned.

the matters addressed under the section titled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” you should
consider carefully the risk factors described below in deciding how to vote. You should also read and consider the risk factors
associated with the businesses of Community Bank System and Merchants because these risk factors may affect the operations and
financial results of the combined company. Community Bank System’s risk factors may be found in Community Bank System’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Merchants’
risk factors may be found in Merchants’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and subsequent
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Risks Related to the Merger

The value of the stock consideration will vary with changes in Community Bank System’s stock price.

Upon completion of the Merger, each share of Merchants common stock will be converted into the right to receive the stock
election consideration, the cash election consideration, or the mixed election consideration, subject to proration as set forth in the
Merger Agreement. The exchange ratio for the stock portion of the merger consideration is fixed. Any change in the market price of
Community Bank System common stock will affect the implied value of the merger consideration that Merchants stockholders will
receive upon completion of the Merger. Accordingly, at the time of the special meeting and at the time that elections are due, you
will not know or be able to determine the value of the stock election consideration or mixed election consideration. Stock price
changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in Community Bank
System’s and Merchants’ respective businesses, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are
beyond the control of Community Bank System and Merchants.

You may not receive the form of merger consideration that you elect.

The consideration to be received by Merchants stockholders in the Merger is subject to proration and adjustment procedures
that are designed to ensure, as nearly as practicable, that the total cash amount of consideration and the total number of shares of
Community Bank System common stock issued, as a whole, will equal the total amount of cash and number of shares that would
have been paid and issued if all of the Merchants stockholders received the mixed election consideration. Accordingly, unless you
elect to receive a combination of 0.6741 shares of Community Bank System common stock and $12.00 in cash per share for your
Merchants shares, there is no assurance that you will receive the form of consideration that you elect with respect to all shares of
Merchants common stock you hold. There is a risk that you will receive a portion of the merger consideration in the form that you
do not elect, which could result in, among other things, tax consequences that differ from those that would have resulted had you
received the form of consideration you elected, including with respect to the recognition of taxable gain to the extent cash is
received. For illustrative examples of how the proration procedures would work in the event there is an oversubscription of the cash
election or stock election in the Merger, see “The Merger Agreement — Election and Proration Procedures” beginning on page 63
of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Community Bank System and Merchants will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the
Merger is pending.

Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger and the NRS acquisition on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on
Merchants and Community Bank System. These uncertainties may impair Community Bank System’s or Merchants’ ability to
attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is consummated, and could cause customers and others that deal with
Merchants or Community Bank System to seek to change existing business relationships with Merchants or Community Bank
System. Retention of certain employees by Merchants may be challenging while the Merger is pending, as certain employees may
experience uncertainty about their future roles with Community Bank System. If key employees depart because of issues relating to
the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Community Bank System, Community Bank System’s business following the Merger could be harmed. In addition, the Merger
Agreement restricts Merchants from operating its business other than in the ordinary course, and prohibits it from taking specified
actions until the Merger occurs without the consent of Community Bank System. These restrictions may prevent Merchants from
pursuing business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger. Please see the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement — Conduct of Business Pending the Merger” beginning on page 68 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus for a description
of the restrictive covenants applicable to Merchants.

There is no assurance when or even if the Merger will be completed.

Completion of the Merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including among others the adoption of
the Merger Agreement by Merchants stockholders and regulatory approvals. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement”
beginning on page 62 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. There can be no assurance that Community Bank System and Merchants
will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond their control will be satisfied or waived.

Community Bank System and Merchants can agree at any time to terminate the Merger Agreement, even if Merchants
stockholders have already voted to adopt the Merger Agreement. Community Bank System and Merchants can also terminate the
Merger Agreement under other specified circumstances.

The fairness opinion delivered to Merchants’ board of directors does not reflect changes in circumstances subsequent to the
date of the fairness opinion.

Piper Jaffray & Co., financial advisor to Merchants in connection with the Merger, delivered its opinion to the board of
directors of Merchants on October 22, 2016. The opinion of Piper speaks only as of such date. Changes in the operations and
prospects of Merchants or Community Bank System, general market and economic conditions and other factors beyond the control
of Merchants or Community Bank System may significantly alter the value of Merchants or the price of shares of Community Bank
System common stock or Merchants common stock by the time the Merger is completed. Piper’s opinion does not speak as of the
time the Merger will be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinion. For a description of Piper’s opinion, please
see the section entitled “The Merger — Opinion of Merchants’ Financial Advisor,” beginning on page 38 of this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. For a description of the other factors considered by the Merchants board of directors in determining to
approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement, please see the sections entitled “The
Merger — Background of the Merger,” and “The Merger — Merchants’ Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of Merchants’
Board of Directors,” beginning on pages 34 and 36, respectively, of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Community Bank System may fail to implement the Merger and the NRS acquisition successfully, achieve savings and
realize the other anticipated benefits from the Merger and the NRS acquisition, which would adversely affect Community
Bank System’s financial condition and results of operations.

The Merger and the NRS acquisition involve the integration of three companies that have previously operated independently.
The difficulties of combining the operations of the three companies include: integrating personnel with diverse business
backgrounds; integrating core processing systems and converting customers to new systems; and retaining key employees. As a
result, Community Bank System may not be able to operate the combined company as effectively as it expects. Community Bank
System may also fail to achieve the anticipated potential benefits of the Merger and/or the NRS acquisition as quickly or as cost
effectively as it anticipates or may not be able to achieve those benefits at all. The management of Community Bank System will
have to dedicate substantial effort to integrating the three companies and, therefore, its focus and resources may be diverted from
other strategic opportunities and from operational matters.

In addition, certain employees of Merchants or NRS may not be employed after the Merger. Employees of Merchants or NRS
that Community Bank System wishes to retain may elect to terminate their employment as a result of the Merger or NRS
acquisition, respectively, which could delay or disrupt the integration process. It is possible that the integration process could result
in the disruption of the ongoing business of Community Bank System and its subsidiaries following the Merger and the NRS
acquisition or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability of Community

Bank System and its subsidiaries to maintain relationships with Merchants’ or NRS’s customers and employees or to achieve the
anticipated benefits of the Merger and the NRS acquisition.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this document is preliminary and the
actual financial condition and results of operations of Community Bank System after the Merger may differ materially.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in this document is presented for illustrative purposes only
and is not necessarily indicative of what Community Bank System’s actual financial condition or results of operations would have
been had the Merger been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
reflects adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to record the Merchants identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase price allocation reflected in this document is
preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be based upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets
and liabilities of Merchants as of the date of the completion of the Merger. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting
adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this document. For more information, see
“Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” beginning on page 81 of this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

Additional growth will subject Community Bank System to additional regulation, increased supervision and increased
costs.

The Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional regulatory requirements on institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Community
Bank System had $8.7 billion in assets as of September 30, 2016. If the pending Merger with Merchants is completed, then
Community Bank System will have more than $10 billion in assets and, as a result, will be subject to the additional regulatory
requirements, increased supervision and increased costs, including but not limited to the following:

• Regulatory stress testing requirements, whereby Community Bank System would be required to conduct an annual stress
test;

• The requirement to maintain an internal risk committee;

• A modified methodology for calculating FDIC insurance assessments and potentially higher assessment rates as a result of
institutions with $10 billion or more in assets being required to bear a greater portion of the cost of raising the reserve ratio
to 1.35% as required by the Dodd-Frank Act;

• Supervision, examination and enforcement by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with respect to
consumer financial protection laws; and

• A cap on the interchange fees that may be charged in certain electronic debit and prepaid card transactions. The maximum
permissible interchange fee for electronic debit transactions is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and five basis points
multiplied by the value of the transaction. In addition, an issuer may charge up to one cent on each transaction as a fraud
prevention adjustment if the issuer meets certain fraud prevention standards.

The imposition of these regulatory requirements and increased supervision may require additional commitment of financial
resources to regulatory compliance and may increase Community Bank System’s cost of operations. Further, the results of the
stress testing process may lead Community Bank System to retain additional capital or alter the mix of its capital components.

Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or impose conditions that are not presently
anticipated.

Before the Merger may be completed, Community Bank System must obtain various approvals or consents, including approvals
or consents from the OCC and the Federal Reserve Board. These governmental entities, including the OCC, may impose conditions
on the completion of the Merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement or the manner in which Merchants or
Community Bank System conducts their respective businesses. Although Community Bank System and Merchants do not currently
expect that any

such conditions or changes would be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be. Such conditions or changes could
have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of Community Bank
System, any of which might have a material adverse effect on Community Bank System following the Merger.

There can be no assurance as to whether the regulatory approvals will be received, the timing of those approvals, or whether
any conditions will be imposed.

Certain of Merchants’ officers and directors have interests that are different from, or in addition to, interests of Merchants
stockholders generally.

Merchants stockholders should be aware that some of Merchants’ directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger
and have arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of Merchants stockholders in general. These interests
include:

• Election of two Merchants directors to the boards of directors of Community Bank System and Community Bank upon the
consummation of the Merger.

• The acceleration of vesting of all unvested equity awards, which will automatically vest in full, with any restrictions thereon
to lapse, and will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment.

• Payment with respect to outstanding stock options held by a director.

• Payment of retention incentives to executive officers.

• Payment of severance benefits under existing employment agreements with Merchants’ executive officers, assuming each
executive officer has a qualifying termination event in connection with the Merger.

• New employment agreements between certain executive officers of Merchants and Community Bank System that will
become effective upon the closing of the Merger, that, among other things, entitle each such executive to receive a cash
bonus as of the effective time of the Merger and include a waiver of the executive’s rights under his or her existing
employment agreement with Merchants and an agreement to certain non-competition and non-solicitation covenants.

• Payment of a pro-rata bonus to certain executive officers at the effective time of the Merger under the Merchants and
Merchants Bank non-equity incentive plans.

• Continued indemnification and liability insurance coverage for directors and executive officers with respect to acts or
omissions occurring before the Merger.

For a more complete description of these interests, see “The Merger — Interests of Merchants’ Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 48 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

The shares of Community Bank System common stock that may be received by Merchants stockholders as a result of the
Merger will have different rights from the shares of Merchants common stock they currently hold.

Following completion of the Merger, Merchants stockholders who receive the stock consideration will no longer be
stockholders of Merchants but will instead be stockholders of Community Bank System. There will be important differences
between the current rights of Merchants stockholders and the rights of Community Bank System stockholders that may be
important to Merchants stockholders. See the section of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus entitled “Comparison of Rights of Holders
of Merchants Common Stock and Community Bank System Common Stock” commencing on page 96 for a detailed description of
the stockholder rights of each corporation.

The price of Community Bank System common stock may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of
Merchants common stock currently, and could decrease after the Merger.

Upon completion of the Merger, holders of Merchants common stock who receive stock consideration will become
stockholders of Community Bank System. Community Bank System common stock could decline in value after the Merger. The
market value of Community Bank System common stock fluctuates based upon

various factors, including changes in the business, operations or prospects of Community Bank System, market assessments of the
Merger and/or the NRS acquisition, regulatory considerations, market and economic considerations, and other factors. Further, the
market price of Community Bank System common stock after the Merger may be affected by factors different from those currently
affecting the common stock of Community Bank System or Merchants. The businesses of Community Bank System and Merchants
differ and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of Community Bank System’s
shares of common stock after the Merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results
of operations and market price of each of Community Bank System or Merchants. For a discussion of the businesses of Community
Bank System and Merchants and of certain factors to consider in connection with their businesses, see the documents incorporated
by reference into this Proxy Statement/Prospectus and referred to under “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on
page 104.

Merchants stockholders will have limited ability to exercise influence over management of the combined organization.

Merchants stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors of Merchants and on other
matters affecting Merchants. Upon the completion of the Merger, each Merchants stockholder who receives shares of Community
Bank System common stock will become a stockholder of Community Bank System with a percentage ownership of the combined
organization that is much smaller than the stockholder’s percentage ownership of Merchants. It is expected that the former common
stockholders of Merchants as a group will receive shares in the Merger constituting less than 9.45% of the outstanding shares of
Community Bank System common stock immediately after the Merger. Merchants stockholders will not have separate approval
rights with respect to any actions or decisions of Community Bank System or have separate representation on Community Bank
System’s board of directors. Because of this, Merchants stockholders will have significantly less influence on the management and
policies of Community Bank System than they now have on the management and policies of Merchants.

Merchants stockholders who hold their stock certificates and make elections will be unable to sell their shares in the market
pending the Merger.

Merchants stockholders who wish to elect the form of merger consideration that they receive must complete an election form
and deliver their Merchants stock certificates. This means that during the time between when the election is made and the date the
Merger is completed, Merchants stockholders will be unable to sell their Merchants common stock. If the Merger is unexpectedly
delayed, this period could extend for a significant period of time. Merchants stockholders can shorten the period during which they
cannot sell their shares by delivering their election shortly before the election deadline. However, elections received after the
election deadline will not be accepted or honored.

If the Merger is not completed, Merchants will have incurred substantial expenses without its stockholders recognizing the
expected benefits.

Merchants has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the Merger. If the Merger is not completed, Merchants expects
that it will have incurred approximately $2.36 million in Merger-related expenses. These expenses would likely have a material
adverse impact on the operating results of Merchants because it would not have realized the expected benefits of the Merger.
Furthermore, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Merchants may be required to pay a termination
fee of $10.72 million to Community Bank System. The payment of the termination fee could have a material adverse effect on
Merchants’ financial condition. See “The Merger Agreement — Termination” and “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fee”
beginning on pages 78 and 80, respectively, of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

The Merger Agreement limits Merchants’ ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger.

The Merger Agreement limits Merchants’ ability to initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or
competing third-party proposals, or knowingly engage in any negotiations, or provide any confidential information, or have any
discussions with any person relating to a proposal to acquire all or a significant part of Merchants. In addition, Merchants has
agreed to pay Community Bank System a

TABLE OF CONTENTS

termination fee in the amount of $10.72 million in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated for certain reasons. These
provisions may discourage a potential competing acquirer that would have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of
Merchants from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share
market price than that proposed in the Merger, or may result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share
price to acquire Merchants than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.

Goodwill incurred in the Merger may negatively affect Community Bank System’s financial condition.

To the extent that the merger consideration, consisting of cash plus the number of shares of Community Bank System common
stock issued or to be issued in the Merger, exceeds the fair value of the net assets, including identifiable intangibles of Merchants,
that amount will be reported as goodwill by Community Bank System. In accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill
will not be amortized but will be evaluated for impairment annually. A failure to realize expected benefits of the Merger could
adversely impact the carrying value of the goodwill recognized in the Merger, and in turn negatively affect Community Bank
System’s financial condition.

If the Merger fails to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, Merchants
stockholders will be required to recognize gain or loss on the exchange of their shares of Merchants common stock in the
Merger for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

It is a condition to the respective obligations of Merchants and Community Bank System to complete the Merger that each of
Merchants and Community Bank System receives a legal opinion to the effect that the Merger qualifies as “reorganization” within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. None of these opinions will be binding on the Internal Revenue Service. Merchants and
Community Bank System have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding any matters
relating to the Merger, and as a result, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not assert, or that a court
would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth herein. If the Merger fails to qualify as a “reorganization”
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, Merchants stockholders will be required to recognize gain or loss on the
exchange of their shares of Merchants common stock in the Merger for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, Merchants
will be treated as having sold all of its assets to Community Bank System in a taxable transaction, and will recognize taxable gain
to the extent the sum of the total consideration paid by Community Bank System to the Merchants stockholders, plus the liabilities
of Merchants, exceeds the tax basis of Merchants in its assets, including its tax basis in its bank and other subsidiaries. Community
Bank System would succeed to and become liable for any such Merchants corporate tax as a consequence of the Merger. For
further information, see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 54 of this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANIES

Community Bank System

Community Bank System is a Delaware corporation registered as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended. Community Bank System was incorporated in April 1983. At September 30, 2016, Community
Bank System had on a consolidated basis approximately $8.7 billion in total assets, $7.1 billion in total deposits, $4.9 billion in
total loans and stockholders’ equity of $1.2 billion. Its common stock is publicly traded on the NYSE under the symbol “CBU”.
Community Bank System, with its principal executive offices in DeWitt, New York, is the parent company of Community Bank,
and is among the country’s 150 largest financial institutions.

Community Bank is a commercial banking franchise with more than 200 customer facilities and 202 ATMs stretching
diagonally from Northern New York to the Southern Tier and west to Lake Erie, and in Northern Pennsylvania. Community Bank is
a national bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Home Loan Bank System, and its deposits are insured
by the FDIC, up to applicable limits.

Community Bank System’s business strategy is to operate as a profitable, diversified financial services company providing a
variety of banking and other financial services, with an emphasis on consumer and residential mortgage lending and commercial
business loans to small and medium-sized businesses. As a result of consolidation of small to medium-sized financial institutions
and the de-emphasis on retail branch banking by larger bank holding companies in the markets Community Bank serves, it believes
there is a significant opportunity for a community-focused bank to provide a full range of financial services to small and middle-
market commercial and retail customers. Community Bank’s branches are located in small towns and villages where competition is
less intense. It emphasizes comprehensive retail and small business products and responsive, decentralized decision-making which
reflect Community Bank’s knowledge of its local markets and customers.

Through its subsidiaries, Community Bank System offers a wide range of commercial and retail banking and financial services
to businesses, individuals, agricultural and government customers. Community Bank’s account services include checking, interest-
bearing checking, money market, savings, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. It also offers residential and
farm loans, business lines of credit, working capital facilities, inventory and dealer floor plans, as well as installment, commercial,
term and student loans. Community Bank’s lending focuses predominantly on consumer and small to medium-sized business
borrowers, which enables its loan portfolio to be highly diversified. Because Community Bank believes that there is a significant
potential market for financial services and products, it offers a full range of services to satisfy its customers’ financial needs. In
addition to traditional banking services and products, it offers personal trust, employee benefit trust, benefits administration and
consulting, investment and insurance services to customers in our banking markets as well as in other parts of the country.
Community Bank’s subsidiary, OneGroup NY, Inc., is a regional insurance broker with headquarters in Syracuse, New York.
Community Bank System’s wholly-owned subsidiary, BPAS, is a leading provider of employee benefits administration and trust
services, and actuarial and consulting services to customers on a national scale.

Community Bank System announced on December 5, 2016 that is has entered into an agreement to acquire NRS, a leading
institutional provider of plan accounting, transfer agency, fund administration, trust and retirement plan services. Upon the closing
of the transaction on February 3, 2017, NRS became a subsidiary of BPAS. The cash and stock transaction is valued at
approximately $140 million.

operations and prospects, you should refer to the documents incorporated in this document by reference. See “Where You Can Find
More Information” on page 104 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

SPECIAL MEETING OF MERCHANTS STOCKHOLDERS

Time, Date and Place of the Special Meeting

Merchants will hold a special meeting of its stockholders on Thursday, March 23, 2017 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, at the
DoubleTree by Hilton, 1117 Williston Road, South Burlington, Vermont 05403.

Actions to be Taken at the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, Merchants stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following matters:

1. a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, which provides for the merger of Merchants with and into Community Bank
System with Community Bank System as the surviving company;

2. a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the Merger-Related Executive Compensation;

3. a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement; and

4. any other business which may properly come before the special meeting or any adjournment thereof.

Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Shares Entitled to Vote

Holders of record of Merchants common stock at the close of business on February 2, 2017, are entitled to vote at the special
meeting. This date is called the “record date.” As of the record date, there were 6,898,903 issued and outstanding shares of
Merchants common stock. Merchants stockholders have one vote per share on any matter that may properly come before the
special meeting.

Recommendation of the Merchants Board of Directors

The Merchants board of directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement. The board of directors of Merchants believes the Merger Agreement is advisable and in the best interests of
Merchants and its stockholders and recommends that you vote your shares as follows:

• “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement;

• “FOR” the approval, on an advisory basis, of the Merger-Related Executive Compensation; and

• “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting.

Broker Non-Votes

Brokers who hold shares of Merchants common stock as nominees will not have discretionary authority to vote these shares
without instructions from the beneficial owners. Any shares of Merchants common stock for which a broker has submitted an
executed proxy but for which the beneficial owner has not given instructions on voting to the broker are referred to as “broker non-
votes.” Broker non-votes will have same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement, but it will have no impact on the
advisory, non-binding proposal to approve the Merger-Related Executive Compensation or the proposal to approve an adjournment
of the special meeting.

Quorum; Vote Required

The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares of Merchants common stock outstanding on the
record date will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting. Abstentions will be included in
determining the presence of a quorum at the special meeting. Broker non-votes would generally be included in determining the
presence of a quorum; however, since the special meeting will consider and vote upon only non-discretionary matters, broker non-
votes will not be included in determining the presence of a quorum.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement.  Adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds
of the outstanding shares of Merchants common stock entitled to vote on the Merger Agreement. Failure to return a properly
executed proxy card or to vote in person will have the same effect as a vote against the Merger Agreement. Abstentions and broker
non-votes will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement.

Proposal II: Approval of the Merger-Related Executive Compensation.  Approval of the Merger-Related Executive
Compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-
votes will not affect whether the proposal is approved.

Proposal III: Approval of the adjournment proposal.  The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal is
required to approve the proposal to adjourn the special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient
votes to approve the Merger Agreement. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not affect whether the proposal is approved.

Share Ownership of Management; Voting Agreements

On the record date, the directors of Merchants and another principal stockholder of Merchants, including certain of their related
parties, had voting power with respect to an aggregate of 739,146 shares of Merchants common stock, or approximately 11% of the
shares of Merchants common stock then outstanding. All of the directors of Merchants and another principal stockholder of
Merchants have agreed to vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement all of the shares of Merchants common stock that
they are entitled to vote.

Voting and Revocation of Proxies

Merchants has enclosed a form of proxy with this document. To ensure your representation at the special meeting, Merchants
recommends that you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the special meeting. You can always change your vote at the special

meeting, and in the discretion of the proxy holders as to any other matter which may properly come before the special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROPOSAL I — THE MERGER

The detailed terms of the Merger are contained in the Merger Agreement attached as Annex A to this document. The following
discussion and the discussion under the caption “The Merger Agreement” describe the more important aspects of the Merger and
material terms of the Merger Agreement. These descriptions are only a summary and are qualified in their entirety by reference to
the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Annex A. You are urged to read the Merger Agreement carefully because it is the legal
document that actually governs your rights in the Merger.

General

The Merger Agreement provides that, after approval by the stockholders of Merchants and the satisfaction or waiver of the
other conditions to the Merger, Merchants will merge with and into Community Bank System, with Community Bank System as
the surviving company. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Community Bank System will be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the surviving company. The directors and officers of Community Bank System immediately prior to
the Merger will be the directors and officers of the surviving company. In addition, two current directors of Merchants will be
appointed to the boards of directors of Community Bank System and Community Bank effective as of the closing date of the
Merger.

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Merchants common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger will be automatically converted into the right to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement (including proration procedures), at the election of the holder thereof, the following consideration: (i) the
combination of $12.00 in cash and 0.6741 shares of Community Bank System common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares;
(ii) $40.00 in cash; or (iii) 0.9630 shares of Community Bank System common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares.

Immediately following the Merger of Community Bank System and Merchants, Merchants Bank will merge with and into
Community Bank, with Community Bank as the surviving entity. After the Bank Merger, branches of Merchants Bank will become
branches of Community Bank.

The companies expect to complete the Merger in late second quarter or early third quarter of calendar year 2017, but they must
first obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and the approval of Merchants stockholders at the special meeting, and satisfy other
customary closing conditions. The companies cannot assure you as to when or if all the conditions to the Merger will be met or
waived, and it is possible they will not complete the Merger at all.

Background of the Merger

The board of directors and management of Merchants periodically review various strategic alternatives as part of their on-going
efforts to improve Merchants’ banking franchise and enhance stockholder value. These reviews have focused on assessing
opportunities for growth and increasing earnings organically and through acquisitions of other banks, as well as the possibility of a
strategic business combination with another banking institution. The board of directors and management of Merchants also
regularly review the banking industry environment, including various interest rate scenarios, regulatory compliance and non-
interest expenses, and the trend towards consolidation, and in light of these and other factors, potential strategies for enhancing
Merchants’ competitive position in this environment.

Consistent with these goals and in the ordinary course of business, members of Merchants’ management have, from time to
time, received inquiries from other banking institutions or their advisors regarding Merchants, and engaged in conversations with
members of management of other banking institutions regarding a possible business combination, including Community Bank
System. In the course of these conversations, Community Bank System expressed a general interest in expanding into Vermont
through a possible strategic transaction with Merchants. However, prior to 2016, the parties did not engage in more significant
discussions.

On April 1, 2016, a director of Community Bank System had a conversation with one of Merchants’ directors in Plattsburgh,
New York, during which the Community Bank System director noted Community Bank System’s potential interest in a business
combination with Merchants at a price in the high $30’s range.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On April 11, 2016, Geoffrey Hesslink, President and Chief Executive Officer of Merchants, and Mark Tryniski, President and
Chief Executive Officer of Community Bank System, met in Burlington, Vermont to discuss their respective businesses and
industry trends. Mr. Hesslink and Mr. Tryniski did not specifically discuss a potential business combination during this meeting.

On May 4, 2016, the Merchants board held a special meeting in Burlington, Vermont. At this meeting, the Merchants board
discussed Community Bank System’s potential interest in a business combination with Merchants. The Merchants board also
reviewed summary historical financial data regarding Merchants and discussed Merchants’ strategic outlook in light of the current
banking industry environment.

On May 26, 2016, the Merchants board held a regularly scheduled meeting in Burlington, Vermont. At this meeting, the
Merchants board continued its discussion of Community Bank System’s potential interest in a business combination with
Merchants and determined that a subset of the Merchants board consisting of Jeffrey Davis, Chairman of the Board of Merchants
(who we refer to in this section as Chairman Davis), Michael Furlong, a director of Merchants and Chairman of the Board of
Merchants Bank, and Mr. Hesslink, should explore Community Bank System’s level of interest.

On June 1, 2016, Chairman Davis, Mr. Furlong and Mr. Hesslink met with Mr. Tryniski and Scott Kingsley, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of Community Bank System, in Lake George, New York, to discuss a potential business
combination between Merchants and Community Bank System. At this meeting, Mr. Tryniski noted Community Bank System’s
potential interest again at a price in the high $30’s range.

On June 8, 2016, Mr. Hesslink met with Piper Jaffray & Co., financial advisor to Merchants (“Piper”), to notify them of the
potential business combination and discuss the assumptions underlying forecasted financial scenarios. Thereafter, Mr. Hesslink and
representatives of Piper met periodically to refine those assumptions.

On June 13, 2016, Merchants and Community Bank System entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement pursuant to which
each party agreed to keep confidential certain non-public information about the other party in connection with the consideration of
a potential business combination. The confidentiality agreement also included customary standstill obligations of Community Bank
System.

Also on June 13, 2016, Merchants entered into a confidentiality agreement with one of its major stockholders, Charles Davis, so
that Merchants could obtain his views on a potential business combination with Community Bank System. Charles Davis is a
former director of Merchants and the brother of Chairman Davis.

On June 14, 2016, Mr. Hesslink met with Mr. Tryniski and Mr. Kingsley in Lake George, New York, to discuss Merchants’
second quarter earnings and other financial matters, as well as the potential structure of the combined company.

On June 15, 2016, Chairman Davis and Mr. Tryniski had a telephone conversation during which they discussed a potential
business combination between Merchants and Community Bank System and the strategic advantages of such a combination.
During this discussion, Mr. Tryniski noted Community Bank System’s potential interest at a price of $40.00.

On June 27, 2016, the Merchants board held a special meeting in Burlington, Vermont, at which members of management and
representatives of Piper and Goodwin Procter LLP, counsel to Merchants (“Goodwin Procter”), were present. At this meeting, the
Merchants board reviewed forecasted financial scenarios for Merchants prepared by management assuming different interest rate
environments, as well as the risks, challenges and strategic opportunities facing the company. The Merchants board also discussed
other strategic alternatives available to the company, including a potential business combination transaction with parties other than
Community Bank System, additional acquisitions in order to achieve scale, and the potential growth or acquisition of non-interest
income businesses. The representatives of Goodwin Procter reviewed the fiduciary duties of the directors in the context of their
consideration of a potential business combination. Piper also presented a situational analysis of Merchants, including an overview
of the U.S. banking market and preliminary financial analyses with respect to a potential business combination with Community
Bank System. The Board discussed with Piper a select number of other banking institutions that may have the capacity to

pay in the $40.00 range being proposed by Community Bank System, and concluded that, based on knowledge of those institutions
and current industry dynamics, it was unlikely that one of those banking institutions would be interested in engaging in a strategic
transaction with Merchants at such a price range at this time.

On July 4, 2016, Chairman Davis and Mr. Hesslink met with Charles Davis in Burlington, Vermont, to obtain Mr. Davis’ views
on a potential business combination between Merchants and Community Bank System. At this meeting, Mr. Davis indicated his
support in exploring a potential transaction with Community Bank System.

On July 7, 2016, the Merchants board held a special meeting in Burlington, Vermont, at which members of management and
representatives of Goodwin Procter were present. At this meeting, the representatives of Goodwin Procter again reviewed the
fiduciary duties of the directors, and the Merchants board discussed whether it was in the best interests of Merchants stockholders
to explore a potential business combination with Community Bank System. After considering current market conditions and the
prospects of Merchants on a stand-alone basis, the Merchants board determined to engage in discussions with Community Bank
System regarding a potential business combination between the two companies. The Merchants board also discussed whether it
might be advisable to explore a potential strategic transaction with other third parties in addition to Community Bank System. In
particular, the Merchants board discussed potential disruptions to Merchants’ business, the risk of leaks that might arise from
making contact with other parties in the industry (and the potential impact on Merchants’ business and employees of such leaks),
the potential loss of Community Bank System as a strategic partner if Community Bank System learned of Merchants’ exploration
of other alternatives, Merchants’ own strong knowledge and understanding of its business prospects and value on a stand-alone
basis, and the likelihood that Merchants would have already been contacted by another banking institution if it were interested in
engaging in strategic discussions with Merchants. Based on the foregoing considerations, the Merchants board concluded not to
approach other potential strategic partners. The Merchants board also formed a Special Committee consisting of Jeffrey Davis,
Michael Furlong and Geoffrey Hesslink to (1) establish, monitor and direct the process and procedures related to the review of the
strategic alternatives of Merchants, (2) invite Community Bank System to submit a written indication of interest, (3) participate in
and direct the negotiation of the material terms and conditions of any such transaction, (4) recommend to the Board of Directors the
advisability of accepting an indication of interest and negotiating a definitive agreement with respect to any such transaction, and
(5) perform any other activities or responsibilities incidental to the foregoing.

Later on July 7, 2016, Chairman Davis and Mr. Hesslink each contacted Mr. Tryniski to report the decision of the Merchants
board to engage in discussions with Community Bank System regarding a potential business combination and to invite Community
Bank System to submit a written indication of interest.

On July 8, 2016, Mr. Tryniski sent a non-binding proposal to Mr. Hesslink with respect to a potential business combination
between Merchants and Community Bank System. The proposal provided for, among other things: (1) a mix of stock and cash
consideration, with approximately 65% of the consideration to be paid in the form of Community Bank System common stock in a
tax-free exchange; (2) a $40.00 per share price, consisting of an unspecified fixed exchange ratio for the stock component of the
consideration and $14.00 per share for the cash component of the consideration; (3) one seat on Community Bank System’s
combined bank/holding company board for an independent director of Merchants to be identified at a later date; (4) a customary
termination provision if Community Bank System’s stock price were to materially decrease both on an absolute basis and in
relation to an appropriate index; (5) a 4% termination fee payable by Merchants; and (6) a requirement that Mr. Hesslink enter into
an employment agreement with Community Bank System to serve as its New England Regional President (no specific terms of an
employment arrangement were included). The proposal also referenced Community Bank System’s commitment to honor the terms
of existing employment, change-in-control, termination and retention agreements of Merchants, and the expected payment of
severance benefits to displaced employees of Merchants in accordance with Community Bank System’s policy and retention
bonuses based on development of an integration plan. Community Bank System’s proposal remained subject to the completion of
due diligence and the execution of a definitive merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On July 15, 2016, the Merchants board held a special telephonic meeting to approve the engagement of Piper as its financial
advisor. In addition, the Merchants board discussed the role members of management should have in connection with the Board’s
consideration of a business combination with Community Bank System given the references to employment and compensation
arrangements with members of management in Community Bank System’s July 8th proposal. Following this discussion, the
Merchants board reconstituted the Special Committee to include only independent and disinterested directors. The Special
Committee thereafter consisted of Chairman Davis, Mr. Furlong and Donald Chase.

On July 19, 2016, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting at which Mr. Hesslink and representatives of Piper and
Goodwin Procter were present. At this meeting, the Special Committee discussed the proposed terms for a business combination
between Merchants and Community Bank System included in Community Bank System’s July 8th proposal in light of current
market conditions and the prospects of Merchants on a stand-alone basis, the competitive landscape and industry trends. At the
conclusion of this discussion, the Special Committee directed Piper to engage in negotiations with Community Bank System’s
financial advisor, RBC Capital Markets, with respect to: (1) fixing the exchange ratio at one share of Community Bank System
common stock for each share of Merchants common stock; (2) increasing the stock component of the merger consideration; (3)
providing for Merchants stockholders to have the right to elect the form of consideration that they would like to receive in the
transaction; (4) having three seats on Community Bank System’s combined bank/holding company board for independent directors
of Merchants to be identified at a later date; (5) decreasing the size of the termination fee payable by Merchants to 2.5%; (6)
providing for additional severance benefits to displaced employees of Merchants; and (7) continuing the use of the Merchants Bank
name. In executive session, the Special Committee also discussed Mr. Hesslink’s potential employment agreement with
Community Bank System referenced in the proposal.

Also on July 19, 2016, Merchants entered into a formal engagement letter with Piper. Prior to engaging Piper, Merchants
confirmed that Piper had no conflicts of interest with respect to Community Bank System.

On July 19 and 20, 2016, representatives of Piper, at the direction of the Special Committee, discussed with representatives of
RBC Capital Markets the terms of Community Bank System’s July 8th proposal.

On July 20, 2016, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting at which Mr. Hesslink and representatives of Piper and
Goodwin Procter were present. At this meeting, the Special Committee continued its discussion of Community Bank System’s July
8th proposal. The representatives from Piper reported on their recent conversations with RBC Capital Markets regarding the
proposal, which had focused on the exchange ratio. Piper reported that RBC had proposed an exchange ratio of 0.95. At the
conclusion of this discussion, the Special Committee directed Piper to propose an exchange ratio of 0.9857, which was based on the
closing price of the common stock of Community Bank System of $40.48 per share on July 7th, the day before Community Bank
System submitted its indication of interest, which resulted in an implied price for the stock consideration of $40.00 per share.

From July 20 through 28, 2016, representatives of Piper, at the direction of the Special Committee, further negotiated with
representatives of RBC Capital Markets regarding the terms of Community Bank System’s July 8th proposal.

On July 26, 2016, Chairman Davis and Mr. Furlong had a telephone conversation with Mr. Tryniski during which they
discussed the terms of Community Bank System’s July 8th proposal.

On July 28, 2016, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting at which Mr. Hesslink and representatives of Goodwin
Procter were present. At this meeting, the Special Committee continued to discuss Community Bank System’s July 8th proposal,
including the termination fee payable by Merchants and the number of seats on Community Bank System’s combined bank/holding
company board to be allocated to Merchants.

On July 29, 2016, Chairman Davis and Mr. Furlong had a telephone conversation with Mr. Tryniski during which they
discussed the number of seats on Community Bank System’s combined bank/holding company board to be allocated to Merchants.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Later on July 29, 2016, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting at which Mr. Hesslink and representatives of Piper
and Goodwin Procter were present. At this meeting, the Special Committee continued to discuss Community Bank System’s July
8th proposal and determined to invite Community Bank System to submit a revised proposal reflecting the recent negotiations
between the parties and their advisors. Following this meeting, Chairman Davis and Mr. Furlong had a telephone conversation with
Mr. Tryniski to report the decision of the Special Committee.

Also on July 29, 2016, a representative of RBC Capital Markets forwarded a revised non-binding proposal to a representative of
Piper for delivery to Merchants. The revised letter of intent provided the following changes to Community Bank System’s July 8th
proposal: (1) approximately 70% of the consideration to be paid in the form of Community Bank System common stock; (2)
subject to allocation and proration procedures, the ability of Merchants stockholders to elect between the stock consideration at a
fixed exchange ratio of 0.963 of a share of Community Bank System common stock or cash consideration of $40.00 per share; (3)
two to three seats on Community Bank System’s combined bank/holding company board for independent directors of Merchants to
be identified at a later date; (4) a 3.5% termination fee payable by Merchants; and (5) increased severance benefits for displaced
employees of Merchants. Based on the closing price of Community Bank System common stock on July 28, 2016 of $44.31, the
implied value of Community Bank System’s offer was $41.87 per share.

On July 30, 2016, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting at which Mr. Hesslink and representatives of Piper and
Goodwin Procter were present. At this meeting, the Special Committee discussed the revised terms for a potential business
combination included in Community Bank System’s July 29th proposal.

On July 31, 2016, Chairman Davis had a telephone conversation with Mr. Tryniski during which they discussed Community
Bank System’s July 29th proposal.

On August 1, 2016, the Special Committee held a special telephonic meeting at which Mr. Hesslink and representatives of Piper
and Goodwin Procter were present. At this meeting, the Special Committee continued to discuss Community Bank System’s July
29th proposal. At the conclusion of this discussion, the Special Committee determined to recommend to the Merchants board that
the company proceed with the proposed business combination with Community Bank System.

On August 2, 2016, the Merchants board held a special meeting in Burlington, Vermont, at which members of management and
representatives of Piper and Goodwin Procter were present. At this meeting, the Merchants board received an update on discussions
with Community Bank System and reviewed the terms of Community Bank System’s July 29th proposal, as well as certain
preliminary financial analyses prepared by Piper with respect to such proposal. The representatives of Goodwin Procter again
reviewed the fiduciary duties of the directors in the context of their consideration of the proposed transaction with Community
Bank System. After extensive discussion regarding the proposal, current market conditions, and the prospects and value of
Merchants on a stand-alone basis, the Merchants board authorized the Special Committee to engage in due diligence activities with
Community Bank System and negotiate a definitive merger agreement with respect to a business combination with Community
Bank System on the terms outlined in the July 29th proposal. Following this meeting, Chairman Davis telephoned Mr. Tryniski to
inform him of the decision of the Merchants board to proceed forward with Community Bank System regarding a potential
business combination.

On August 3, 2016, Merchants countersigned the non-binding letter of intent provided by Community Bank System on July
29th, and thereafter, a representative of RBC Capital Markets on behalf of Community Bank System sent a due diligence request
list to Piper.

On August 16, 2016 and throughout the remainder of the process, the Compensation Committee of the Merchants board held
meetings at which the Compensation Committee discussed the need to (1) ensure existing contracts with employees were honored

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On September 20, 2016, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting at which Mr. Hesslink and representatives of Piper
and Goodwin Procter were present. At this meeting, the Special Committee discussed Community Bank System’s due diligence
findings and the one-time deal costs and potential reductions in Merchants’ operating costs on a post-closing basis. At the
conclusion of this discussion, the Special Committee authorized management and Piper to work with Community Bank System to
better understand these costs. The Special Committee also discussed the reverse due diligence process.

From September 21 through 27, 2016, representatives of Community Bank System and Merchants discussed Community Bank
System’s due diligence findings and the expected cost savings and restructuring costs. As part of these discussions, RBC Capital

Merchants stockholders. Piper, at the direction of the Special Committee, informed RBC Capital Markets that Merchants was not
open to discussing a potential reduction in the exchange ratio.

On September 29, 2016, Chairman Davis and Mr. Tryniski had a telephone conversation during which they further discussed

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On October 22, 2016, the Special Committee and the Merchants board held a joint special meeting in Essex, Vermont, at which
representatives of management, Piper and Goodwin Procter were present. At this meeting, Goodwin Procter provided an update on
the final negotiations with Community Bank System and its counsel, and Piper reviewed with the Merchants board its final
analyses of the consideration offered in the proposed transaction from a financial point of view. Piper then provided its oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of October 22, 2016 and subject to the assumptions, qualifications
and limitations set forth in the opinion, the consideration to be received pursuant to the merger agreement is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Merchants common stock. Based on the closing price of Community Bank System common stock
on October 21, 2016 of $47.50, the implied value of the merger consideration was $44.02 per share. After discussion, and upon
recommendation of the Special Committee, the Merchants board unanimously adopted resolutions (1) determining that the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the Merchants
stockholders, (2) adopting the merger agreement and approving the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, and (3) recommending to Merchants stockholders that they adopt the merger agreement.

Later on October 22, 2016, the merger agreement and voting agreements were executed. Community Bank System also entered
into employment agreements with Mr. Hesslink and the other executives of Merchants who would be continuing with the combined
company following the closing, and retention agreements with members of Merchants’ management whose employment would not
be continuing.

On October 24, 2016, before the U.S. stock markets opened, Merchants and Community Bank System issued a joint press
release announcing the transaction.

Merchants’ Reasons for the Merger

In the course of its evaluation of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, the Merchants board of directors held numerous
meetings and consulted with Merchants’ senior management as well as its legal counsel and financial advisor. In reaching its
decision to approve the Merger and the Merger Agreement and recommend the adoption of the Merger Agreement by its
stockholders, the Merchants board considered a number of factors, including, among others, the following:

• the Merchants board’s and management’s knowledge of Merchants’ business, operations, properties, assets, financial
condition, operating results, historical market prices and prospects, and its and their understanding of Community Bank
System’s business, operations, properties, assets, financial condition, operating results, historical market prices and
prospects, including the information obtained through due diligence;

• Merchants’ business and financial prospects if it were to remain an independent banking institution, including local
economic conditions, the interest rate environment, increasing operating costs resulting from regulatory initiatives and
compliance mandates, and the competitive environment for financial institutions generally, all of which would likely
impede Merchants’ ability to develop the scale necessary to achieve the premium to Merchants’ trading price that
Community Bank System’s offer price presented;

• the availability of alternative transactions, including the fact that, in a consolidating industry, institutions with an interest in
merging with another institution typically made that interest known; the attractiveness and strategic fit of Community Bank
System as a potential merger partner; and the likelihood of an alternative transaction emerging;

• the fact that a significant portion of the merger consideration consists of registered shares of Community Bank System
common stock and the potential that the value of Community Bank System common stock will increase after the signing of
the Merger Agreement;

• the ability of Merchants stockholders to elect the form of merger consideration that they wish to receive in the Merger,
subject to the proration procedures described in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• the October 22, 2016 financial presentation of Piper (including the assumptions and methodologies underlying the analyses
in connection therewith) and the written opinion of Piper delivered to the Merchants board of directors on October 22,
2016, a copy of which is attached to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus as Annex B, to the effect that, as of October 22, 2016
and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken in preparing such opinion, the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Merchants common stock, as more fully described under “— Opinion of Merchants’ Financial Advisor”;

• the efforts made to negotiate a Merger Agreement favorable to Merchants and its stockholders and the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement, including the termination fees and circumstances under which such fees are payable by
Merchants;

• the ability of Merchants under the terms of the Merger Agreement to negotiate with third parties concerning certain
unsolicited competing acquisition proposals if Merchants were to receive such a proposal prior to the adoption of the
Merger Agreement by Merchants stockholders, and to terminate the Merger Agreement upon the payment to Community
Bank System of a termination fee of $10.72 million;

• the right of Merchants to terminate the Merger Agreement if, subject to Community Bank System’s ability to make a
compensating adjustment to the stock election consideration, the volume-weighted average trading price of Community
Bank System common stock for a specified period prior to the date on which Merchants stockholder approval and all
required regulatory approvals have been obtained or waived is less than $35.77 per share and Community Bank System
common stock underperforms a peer group index by more than 20%;

• the fact that the Merger is expected to be tax-free to Merchants stockholders to the extent that they receive Community
Bank System common stock in exchange for their shares of Merchants common stock; and

• the fact that two representatives from the Merchants board will be directors of Community Bank System and Community
Bank following the closing of the Merger.

The Merchants board of directors also weighed the factors described above against certain factors and potential risks associated
with entering into the Merger Agreement, including, among others, the following:

• the fact that the exchange ratio is fixed, which means that Merchants stockholders could be adversely affected by a decrease
in the trading price of Community Bank System common stock following the signing of the Merger Agreement;

• the possibility of costs and delays resulting from seeking the regulatory approvals necessary to complete the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the possibility that the Merger may not be completed if such approvals are not
obtained, and the potential negative impacts on Merchants, its business and the price of Merchants common stock if such
approvals are not obtained;

• the fact that the integration of Merchants and Community Bank System may be complex and time consuming and may
require substantial resources and effort, and the risk that if the combined bank is not successfully integrated, the anticipated
benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, due to the additional
regulatory requirements that Community Bank System will be subject to as a result of it having more than $10 billion in
assets following the Merger;

• the possibility that the anticipated strategic and other benefits to Merchants and the combined bank following the
completion of the Merger will not be realized or will take longer to realize than expected;

• the potential for diversion of management and employee attention and for increased employee attrition during the period
prior to the completion of the Merger, and the potential effect of the Merger on Merchants’ customers and business
relationships;

• the restrictions on the conduct of Merchants’ business prior to the completion of the Merger, requiring Merchants to
conduct its business only in the ordinary course, subject to specific limitations, which could delay or prevent Merchants
from undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the Merger and could negatively impact
Merchants’ customers and business relationships;

• the fact that the Merger Agreement contains certain restrictions on the ability of Merchants to solicit proposals for
alternative transactions or engage in discussions regarding such proposals, including the requirement for Merchants to pay
Community Bank System a termination fee of $10.72 million in certain circumstances;

• the transaction costs to be incurred by Merchants in connection with the Merger;

• the fact that Merchants will lose the autonomy associated with being an independent financial institution; and

• the various other applicable risks associated with Merchants, Community Bank System and the Merger, including the risks
described in “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” beginning on page 21 and
15, respectively.

In considering the recommendation of the Merchants board of directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, you should be aware that certain of Merchants’ directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that
are different from yours. The Merchants board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and in recommending that the Merger Agreement
be adopted by the Merchants stockholders. Please see “— Interests of Merchants Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”
beginning on page 48.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Merchants board of directors in reaching its
conclusions and recommendations is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the Merchants
board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the complexity of these matters, the Merchants Board did not find it
practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign any relative or specific weights to the various specific
factors considered in reaching its determination and making its recommendation. Moreover, in considering the factors described
above and any other factors, individual members of the Merchants Board may have viewed factors differently or given different
weight, merit or consideration to different factors. The Merchants board considered all of the foregoing factors as a whole and
based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented.

Recommendation of the Merchants Board of Directors

At a meeting held on October 22, 2016, the Merchants board of directors unanimously (i) determined that the Merger
Agreement and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests of Merchants and its stockholders, (ii) approved the Merger
Agreement and recommended that the Merchants stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, and (iii) directed that the Merger
Agreement be submitted for consideration by the Merchants stockholders at the Merchants special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Community Bank System’s Reasons for the Merger

In reaching its determination to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, the board of directors of Community Bank System
considered a number of factors, including:

• the opportunity to further diversify Community Bank System’s geographical markets and customer base as a whole by
expanding into Vermont and Western Massachusetts, which is a natural expansion of Community Bank’s existing footprint
in Upstate New York, and to do so in smaller markets similar to those in which it currently operates;

• the opportunity to acquire the largest statewide independent bank in Vermont with 11% market share and ranked third in
deposits;

• the pricing of the transaction absorbs the cost of Community Bank System crossing the $10 billion in asset threshold and
the enhanced regulatory burdens and costs associated with operating a financial holding company of that size;

• Community Bank System’s past experience and success in the acquisition and integration of a bank holding company;

• the fact that the Merger is expected to be accretive to operating earnings per share of Community Bank System in 2018,
exclusive of one-time acquisition related charges and the impact of Community Bank System crossing the $10 billion in
asset threshold;

• the potential for the combined company to enhance non-interest income growth by providing enhanced and additional
financial products and services to the customers of Merchants in the areas of benefit plan administration, investment
management, comprehensive cash management, brokerage services and insurance;

• the business, operations, technology, asset quality, competitive position, stock price performance, financial condition and
results of operations of Merchants on a historical and prospective basis;

• the anticipated operating efficiencies, cost savings and opportunities for revenue enhancements of the combined company
following the completion of the Merger, and the likelihood that they would be achieved after the Merger;

• the exchange ratio for the Merger and the resulting relative interests of Community Bank System stockholders in the
common stock of the combined company, and the amount of total cash consideration to be paid in the Merger;

• the fact that the mixture of merger consideration includes a combination of cash and stock in which stockholders would
have an election right, but no more than 30% of Merchants common stock would be exchanged for cash;

• the deal protection provided by the termination fee of $10.72 million, payable under certain circumstances in the event of
the termination of the Merger Agreement due to a competing offer or certain other reasons;

• the intended tax treatment of the Merger; and

• the likelihood of receiving all of the regulatory approvals required for the Merger.

Based on these reasons, Community Bank System’s board of directors unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the
Merger. This discussion of the factors considered by Community Bank System’s board of directors does not list every factor
considered by the board but includes all material factors considered by the board. In reaching its determination to approve and
adopt the Merger Agreement, the board did not give relative or specific importance to each of the factors listed above, and
individual directors may have given differing importance to different factors. Please note that this explanation of the board’s
reasoning and all other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of
the factors discussed under the heading “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 21 of
this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Opinion of Merchants’ Financial Advisor

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated July 19, 2016, the Merchants board engaged Piper as financial advisor to Merchants in
connection with Merchants’ consideration of a possible business combination with Community Bank System. Piper is a nationally
recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger and is familiar with
Merchants and its business. As part of its investment banking business, Piper is routinely engaged in the valuation of financial
institutions and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions. The Piper written opinion, dated October 22, 2016, is
sometimes referred to in this section as the “Piper opinion.”

Piper acted as financial advisor to Merchants in connection with the proposed transaction and participated in certain of the
negotiations leading to the execution of the Merger Agreement. At the meeting of the board of directors of Merchants held on
October 22, 2016, Piper delivered to the board of directors its oral opinion, followed by delivery of its written opinion, that, as of
such date, and based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions and limitations set forth in its opinion, the consideration
offered in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Merchants common stock.

The full text of Piper’s written opinion dated October 22, 2016, which sets forth, among other things, the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken in
rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference.
Piper’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. You are urged to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety.
Piper’s opinion was addressed to, and provided for the information and benefit of, the Merchants board of directors (in its
capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view,
and did not address any other aspects or implications of the Merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to
the Merchants board of directors or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of
Merchants common stock should vote at any stockholders’ meeting held in connection with the Merger or take, or not to
take, any action in respect of the Merger. Piper’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to
any other business or financial strategies that might be available to Merchants, nor does it address the underlying business
decision of Merchants to engage in the Merger. The issuance of the Piper opinion was approved by the fairness opinion
committee of Piper. The summary of the opinion of Piper set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the opinion. Piper has consented to the inclusion of this summary of its opinion in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

In rendering its opinion, Piper reviewed and analyzed, among other things:

• the financial terms contained in a draft of the Merger Agreement dated as of October 22, 2016;

• certain financial and other data with respect to Merchants and Community Bank System, which was publicly available or
made available to Piper by Merchants or Community Bank System;

• certain forward-looking information relating to Merchants and Community Bank System that was publicly available, as
well as that which was furnished to Piper by Merchants or Community Bank System, including the Projections;

• materials detailing the Merger prepared by Merchants, Community Bank System and their affiliates and by their respective
legal and accounting advisors including the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related expenses (which
included (1) estimated synergies of approximately 22.7% of Merchants’ non-interest expense base with 75% phased-in
2017 and 100% in 2018 and going forward and (2) an estimated $10.0 million pre-tax annual negative impact to income for
Community Bank System due to $10 billion asset threshold beginning in the second half of 2018) and purchase accounting
adjustments expected to result from the Merger (which included (1) 0.89% gross credit mark ($12.4 million or 1.0x
reserves) on the acquired loan portfolio and (2) core deposit intangible assumed to equal 1.5% of Merchants’ core deposits
(deposits less all time deposits)) (which are collectively referred to in this section as the “Synergies”);

• current and historical reported prices and trading activity of Merchants and Community Bank System and similar
information for certain other publicly traded companies deemed by Piper to be comparable to Merchants and Community
Bank System;

• the financial performance of Merchants and Community Bank System with that of certain other publicly traded companies
that Piper deemed relevant;

• certain financial analyses Piper performed for Merchants and Community Bank System on a pro forma combined basis
giving effect to the Merger based on assumptions relating to the Synergies;

• the merger consideration relative to the historical trading price of Merchants and Merchants’ tangible book value, core
deposits (deposits less all jumbo time deposits and brokered deposits) and last twelve months earnings as of June 30, 2016
as well as analyst estimated earnings for 2017;

• the current market environment generally and the commercial banking environment in particular;

• the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain business combination transactions in the depository banking
industry that Piper deemed relevant; and

• such other analyses, examinations and inquiries and considered such other financial, economic and market criteria as Piper
deemed necessary in arriving at its opinion.

Piper also held several discussions with certain members of senior management and representatives of both Merchants and
Community Bank System with respect to certain aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business operations of Merchants
and Community Bank System, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of Merchants and Community Bank
System, the effects of the Merger on the financial condition and future prospects of Community Bank System, and certain other
matters Piper believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.

In arriving at its opinion, Piper relied upon and assumed, without assuming liability or responsibility for independent
verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished, or otherwise made
available to, or discussed with or reviewed by Piper. Piper further relied upon the assurances of the management of Merchants and
Community Bank System that the financial information provided has been prepared on a reasonable basis in accordance with
industry practice, and that they are not aware of any information or facts that would make any information provided to Piper
incomplete or misleading. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Piper assumed that with respect to financial forecasts,
estimates and other forward-looking information (including the Synergies) reviewed by Piper, that such information was reasonably
prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Merchants
and Community Bank System as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of Merchants and Community
Bank System, respectively, to which such financial forecasts, estimates and other forward-looking information (including the
Synergies) relate and Piper assumed that such results would be achieved. Piper expressed no opinion as to any such financial
forecasts, estimates or forward-looking information (including the Synergies) or the assumptions on which they were based. Piper
further assumed that the Merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, for United States federal income tax purposes. Piper also expressed no opinion as to any of the legal,
accounting and tax matters relating to the Merger and any other transactions contemplated in connection therewith and with the
consent of Merchants relied, on the advice of the outside legal counsel and the independent accountants to Merchants, and on the
assumptions of the management of Merchants and Community Bank System, as to all accounting, legal, tax and financial reporting
matters with respect to Merchants and Community Bank System and the Merger Agreement.

In arriving at its opinion, Piper assumed that the executed Merger Agreement would be in all material respects identical to the
last draft reviewed by it. Piper relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that:

• the representations and warranties of all parties to the Merger Agreement and all other related documents and instruments
that are referred to therein are true and correct;

• each party to such agreements will fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed
by such party;

• the Merger will be consummated pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement without amendments thereto; and

obligations thereunder.

Additionally, Piper assumed that all the necessary regulatory approvals and consents required for the Merger will be obtained in
a manner that will not adversely affect Merchants and Community Bank System or the contemplated benefits of the Merger.

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Piper did not perform any appraisals or valuations of any specific assets or liabilities
(fixed, contingent, derivative, off-balance sheet, or other) of Merchants or Community Bank System, and was not furnished or
provided with any such appraisals or valuations, and did not evaluate the solvency of Merchants or Community Bank System under
any state or federal law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Accordingly, Piper expressed no opinion regarding
the liquidation value of Merchants, Community Bank System or any other entity. Piper assumed that there has been no material
change in the respective assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of Merchants or Community Bank
System since the date of the most recent financial data made available to Piper. Piper also assumed in all respects material to its
analysis that Merchants and Community Bank System would remain as a going concern for all periods relevant to its analysis.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Piper did not conduct a review of:

• any individual credit files of Merchants or Community Bank System, nor evaluate the adequacy of the loan or lease
reserves of Merchants or Community Bank System;

• any credit mark that may be taken in connection with the Merger, nor evaluate the adequacy of any contemplated credit
mark to be so taken; or

• the collectability of any asset or the future performance of any loan of Merchants or Community Bank System.

Piper also assumed, with Merchants’ consent, that the respective allowances for loan and lease losses for both Merchants and
Community Bank System and the credit mark are adequate to cover any losses and will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the
combined company. Accordingly, Piper expressed no opinion with respect to these matters.

In addition, Piper did not make any independent analysis of any pending or threatened litigation, regulatory action, possible
unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities to which Merchants or Community Bank System is a party or may be subject, and
at the direction of Merchants and with its consent, Piper’s opinion makes no assumption concerning, and therefore does not
consider, the possible assertion of claims, outcomes or damages arising out of any such matters. Piper also assumed that neither
Merchants nor Community Bank System is party to any material pending transaction, including without limitation any financing,
recapitalization, acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-off, other than the Merger and the merger of the principal banking
subsidiaries of Merchants and Community Bank System contemplated by the agreement.

The Piper opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions and upon the information made available to
Piper and facts and circumstances as they exist and are subject to evaluation as of the date of the Piper opinion. It should be
understood that events occurring after the date of the Piper opinion could materially affect the assumptions used in preparing the
Piper opinion. Further, Piper expressed no opinion as to the price at which shares of the common stock of Merchants or Community
Bank System may trade following announcement of the Merger or at any future time.

The Piper opinion addresses solely the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Merchants common stock of the
proposed merger consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement and does not address any other terms or agreement relating to the
Merger or any other terms of the Merger Agreement. Piper was

not requested to opine as to, and the Piper opinion does not address: (1) the basic business decision to proceed with or effect the
Merger; (2) the merits of the Merger relative to any alternative transaction or business strategy that may be available to Merchants;
(3) Community Bank System’s ability to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration; (4) any other terms contemplated by the
Merger Agreement; or (5) the fairness of the Merger, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any
other class of securities, any creditor or other constituency of Merchants. Furthermore, Piper expressed no opinion with respect to
the amount or nature of compensation to any officer, director or employee of any party to the Merger, or any class of such persons,
relative to the merger consideration to be received by holders of Merchants common stock in the Merger or with respect to the
fairness of any such compensation, including whether such payments are reasonable in the context of the Merger.

In performing its analyses, Piper made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of Piper, Merchants and Community
Bank System. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by Piper are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future
results, which may be more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or
securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold.
Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, the Piper opinion was
among several factors taken into consideration by the Merchants board in making its determination to approve the Merger
Agreement. The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger were determined solely through negotiation between
Merchants and Community Bank System, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Merchants
board.

Piper’s opinion was necessarily based upon conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on October 22, 2016, the date of
such opinion, and the information made available to Piper through such date. Developments subsequent to the date of Piper’s
opinion may have affected, and may affect, the conclusion reached in Piper’s opinion, and Piper did not and does not have an
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed and presented by Piper to the Merchants board on
October 22, 2016 in connection with its fairness opinion. Each analysis was provided to the Merchants board of directors. The
following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of all the analyses performed and reviewed by Piper
underlying the Piper opinion or the presentation made by Piper to the Merchants board on October 22, 2016, but summarizes the
material analyses performed and presented in connection with such opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
analytic process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances. A fairness opinion is thus not susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Piper did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it
considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor.

The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of the financial analyses. Accordingly, Piper believes that its analyses and the summary of its analyses must
be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented below in
tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a potentially misleading or incomplete view of the process
underlying its analyses and opinion. Also no company or transaction used in Piper’s analysis for purposes of comparison is
identical to Merchants and Community Bank System or the Merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the comparisons is
not mathematical; rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments about differences in the companies and transactions to
which Merchants and Community Bank System and the Merger were compared and other factors that could affect the public
trading value or transaction value of the companies to which they are being compared. Except as otherwise noted, the following
quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data that existed on or before October 22,
2016 (the date of the Piper opinion), and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Summary of Proposal.  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of
Merchants common stock will be converted, at the election of the holder, into the right to receive the following consideration: (i)
the combination of $12.00 in cash and 0.6741 shares of Community Bank System common stock; (ii) 0.9630 shares of Community
Bank System common stock; or (iii) $40.00 in cash, subject to an allocation process intended to result in approximately 70% of the
shares of Merchants common stock being exchanged for shares of Community Bank System. Based on Community Bank System’s
closing price on October 21, 2016 of $47.50, the merger consideration was equivalent to a price of $44.02 per share of Merchants
common stock. Based on this deemed value per share to Merchants stockholders and based on an aggregate of 6,883,644 shares of
Merchants common stock outstanding, 27,020 options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $22.49 per share and
77,999 warrants outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $29.81, the aggregate merger consideration to holders of
Merchants common stock, options and warrants was approximately $304.7 million.

Comparable Transaction Analysis.  Piper reviewed certain publicly available information related to twelve selected acquisitions
of banks and bank holding companies as well as thrifts and thrift holding companies with headquarters in the New England and
Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States announced after January 1, 2013, where transaction value was available and the buyer
was a bank or bank holding company or a thrift or thrift holding company, the seller had assets between $1.0 billion and $3.0
billion and last twelve months return on average assets between 0.25% and 1.25%. The transactions included in the group were:

 
Acquiror  Acquiree
OceanFirst Financial Corp.  Ocean Shore Holding Co.
People's United Financial, Inc.  Suffolk Bancorp

Transaction multiples for the Merger were based on an offer price of $44.02 per share for Merchants based on Community
Bank System’s October 21, 2016 closing price of $47.50. For each precedent transaction, Piper derived and compared, among other
things, the implied ratio of price per common share paid for the acquired company to:

• tangible book value per share of the acquired company based on the latest financial statements of the company available
prior to the announcement of the acquisition;

• tangible equity premium to core deposits (total deposits less time deposits greater than $100,000 and brokered deposits)
based on the latest financial statements of the company available prior to the announcement of the acquisition;

• the last twelve months earnings per share based on the latest financial statements of the company available prior to the
announcement of the acquisition; and

• analyst estimated earnings per share for the forward year at the announcement of the acquisition.

Using the range of multiples representing the 25th and 75th percentiles, the analysis indicated an approximate implied per share
equity value range for Merchants of $29.75 to $47.40 based on the selected transactions.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  Piper performed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate a range of the present values of
after-tax cash flows that Merchants could provide to equity holders through 2020 on a stand-alone basis. In performing this
analysis, Piper used the Projections to derive projected after-tax cash flows. The analysis assumed discount rates ranging from
11.0% to 13.0%, which were assumed deviations, both up and down, as selected by Piper based on the Merchants discount rate of
11.8% as determined by Piper. The range of values for the discounted cash flow analysis was determined by adding (1) the present
value of projected cash flows to Merchants stockholders from fiscal years 2016 to 2020 and (2) the present value of the terminal
value of Merchants common stock. In determining cash flows available to Merchants stockholders, Piper assumed that Merchants
would maintain a tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio of 7.00% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain these
levels. Any earnings in excess of what would need to be retained were assumed to be distributed as dividends to Merchants
stockholders. In calculating the terminal value of Merchants, Piper applied multiples ranging from 13.0 times to 15.0 times fiscal
year 2020 estimated earnings. These multiples were selected based on a review of trading multiples of common stocks of the
selected bank holding companies headquartered in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States with total assets
between $1.0 billion and $3.0 billion specified above. Piper also assumed a pre-tax cost of cash of 1.50% and a marginal tax rate of
35.0%. This resulted in a range of values of Merchants from $29.71 to $35.34 per share.

Piper also performed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate a range of the present values of after-tax cash flows that
Community Bank System could provide to equity holders through fiscal year 2020 on a stand-alone basis and on a pro forma basis,
which included the Synergies and the impact of crossing the $10 billion threshold. In performing this analysis, Piper used publicly
available earnings estimates by research analysts covering Community Bank System, which were discussed with senior
management of Community Bank System, for fiscal years 2016 (EPS of $2.32) and 2017 (EPS of $2.40), and with respect to the
fiscal years 2018 through 2020 applied an earnings growth rate of 5.0% to derive projected after-tax cash flows. The analysis
assumed discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 12.0%, which were assumed deviations, both up and down, as selected by Piper
based on the Community Bank System discount rate of 11.3% as determined by Piper. The analysis also assumed asset growth
based on analyst estimates through 2017 and 3.0% growth thereafter. The range of values for the discounted cash flow analysis was
determined by adding (1) the present value of projected cash flows to Community Bank System’s stockholders from fiscal years
2016 to 2020 and (2) the present value of the terminal value of Community Bank System’s common stock. In determining cash
flows available to stockholders, Piper assumed that Community Bank System would maintain a tangible common equity to tangible
asset ratio of 7.00% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain these levels. Any earnings in excess of what would need to be
retained were assumed to be distributed as dividends to Community Bank System stockholders. In calculating the terminal value of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Community Bank System, Piper applied multiples ranging from 17.0 times to 19.0 times fiscal year 2020 estimated earnings. These
multiples were selected based on a review of trading multiples of the eight publicly traded bank holding companies headquartered
in the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States with total assets between $5.0 billion and $12.0 billion specified
above. Piper also assumed a pre-tax cost of cash of 1.50% and a marginal tax rate of 35.0%. This resulted in a range of values of
Community Bank System on a stand-alone basis from $41.72 to $48.43 per share and on a pro forma basis from $41.60 to $48.58
per share.

Piper stated that the discounted cash flow present value analysis is a widely used valuation methodology but noted that it relies
on numerous assumptions, including asset and earnings growth rates, terminal values and discount rates. The analysis did not
purport to be indicative of the actual values or expected values of Merchants and Community Bank System.

Financial Impact Analysis.  Piper performed pro forma merger analyses that combined projected income statement and balance
sheet information of Merchants and Community Bank System. Assumptions regarding the Synergies were used to calculate the
financial impact that the Merger would have on certain projected financial results of Community Bank System. In the course of this
analysis, Piper used the Projections for Merchants and used assumptions provided by Community Bank System’s management for
the Synergies. For Community Bank System, Piper used publicly available earnings estimates by research analysts covering
Community Bank System for 2016 and 2017 and applied an earnings growth rate of 5.0% thereafter. This analysis indicated that
the Merger is expected to be accretive to Community Bank System’s estimated earnings per share in 2017 and 2018. The analysis
also indicated that the Merger is expected to be dilutive to tangible book value per share for Community Bank System with an
earnback (using the Crossover method) of 4.7 years including the impact of crossing the $10 billion asset threshold, 3.3 years
excluding the impact of crossing the $10 billion asset threshold and dilutive to Community Bank System’s tangible common equity
to tangible assets ratio, leverage ratio and total risk-based capital ratio. For all of the above analyses, the actual results achieved by
Community Bank System following the Merger will vary from the projected results, and the variations may be material.

Other Analyses.  Among other things, Piper also reviewed earnings estimates, balance sheet composition and other financial
data for Merchants and Community Bank System. With respect to Merchants’ public price, Piper reviewed the public price targets
of the three research analysts covering Merchants as provided by SNL Financial, a nationally recognized research price target
consolidator, of which the mean was $33.50. With respect to Community Bank System’s public price, Piper reviewed the public
price targets of the five research analysts covering Community Bank System as provided by SNL, of which the mean was $42.80.
Piper also reviewed the historical trading performances of shares of Merchants and Community Bank System common stock during
the 52-week period ended October 21, 2016. Merchants common stock traded as low as $27.21 per share and as high as $33.99 per
share, and the closing price of Merchants common stock on October 21, 2016 was $32.85 per share. Community Bank System
common stock traded as low as $34.47 per share and as high as $48.67 per share, and the closing price of Community Bank System
common stock on October 21, 2016 was $47.50 per share.

Piper’s Compensation and Other Relationships.  Merchants and Piper entered into an engagement letter dated July 19, 2016
relating to the services to be provided by Piper in connection with the Merger. Pursuant to the engagement letter, Merchants agreed
to pay Piper (a) a fee of $250,000 upon the delivery to the Merchants board of the written Piper opinion, which fee will be credited
against the transaction fee; and (b) contingent upon closing of the Merger, a transaction fee of $1.9 million. Pursuant to the Piper
engagement letter, Merchants also agreed to reimburse Piper for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements incurred in
connection with its retention up to $25,000 without Merchants prior written consent. Merchants has also agreed to indemnify Piper
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement.

Other than Piper’s engagement by Merchants in connection with the Merger, Piper has not provided any other material
investment banking or financial advisory services to Merchants, Community Bank System or their affiliates during the past two
years; however, Piper may do so in the future. In the ordinary course of

Community Bank System or their affiliates.

Certain Prospective Financial Information

Merchants does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or projections of its expected future financial
performance, earnings or other results because of, among other things, the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance
for future periods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be realized. However, Merchants is
including in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus certain unaudited prospective financial information that was prepared based on
publicly available earnings estimates (the “Projections”). The Projections were discussed with Piper and used by Piper in
connection with its financial analyses and opinion to the Merchants board of directors as described above under the heading
“— Opinion of Merchants’ Financial Advisor.” The Projections also were provided to the Merchants board in its consideration of
the Merger.

The Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with
published guidelines of the SEC or established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and
presentation of prospective financial information or generally accepted accounting principles. Merchants’ independent registered
public accounting firm, which is listed as an expert in the section entitled “Experts,” or any other independent accountants, did not
compile, examine, audit, or perform any procedures with respect to such prospective financial information, and has not expressed
any opinion or any other form of assurance on this information or its achievability.

The Projections, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions
that are inherently uncertain and many of which are beyond the control of Merchants’ management. Given that the Projections
cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. The assumptions upon
which the Projections were based necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, market,
competitive and regulatory conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict and many of which are beyond Merchants’
control. Important factors that may affect actual results and the achievability of the Projections include, but are not limited to, the
risks and uncertainties described in Merchants’ annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015,
subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. See “Where You Can Find More Information”
beginning on page 104 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

The Projections also reflect assumptions that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic
revisions based on actual results, revised prospects for Merchants’ business, changes in general business or economic conditions, or
any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated when the Projections were prepared.
In addition, the Projections do not take into account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the dates on which
the Projections were prepared. Accordingly, actual results will differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the
Projections. There can be no assurance that the financial results in the Projections will be realized, or that future actual financial
results will not materially vary from those in the Projections.

The inclusion of a summary of the Projections should not be regarded as an indication that Community Bank System or
Merchants or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives consider the Projections to be
predictive of actual future events, and the Projections should not be relied upon as such. None of Community Bank System or
Merchants or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives gives any stockholder of
Merchants or any other person any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the Projections, and, except as
otherwise required by law, Community Bank System, Merchants and their respective affiliates undertake no obligation to update or
otherwise revise or reconcile the Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the dates on which the Projections were
prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions and estimates underlying
the Projections are shown to be in error.

In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections, Merchants stockholders are cautioned
not to place undue, if any, reliance on such Projections.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The following table presents a summary of the Projections, which has been included solely to give the Merchants stockholders
access to certain prospective financial information that was made available to the Merchants board and used by Piper, and is not
included in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus to influence any decision of Merchants stockholders as to whether to vote to adopt the
Merger Agreement or for any other purpose. The Projections are based on publicly available earnings estimates by research
analysts covering Merchants through 2017, with an earnings growth rate of 5.0% applied to derive fiscal years 2018 through 2020.
The projected financial data provided in this table has not been updated to reflect Merchants’ current views of its future financial
performance, and should not be treated as guidance with respect to projected results for 2016 or any other period.

(1) Based on actual results for the first six months of calendar year 2016, and publicly available earnings estimates of research
analysts for the remainder of the calendar year.

The Projections were used to derive projected after-tax cash flows based on assumptions provided by management, including
(1) asset growth based on analyst estimates through 2017 and 4.0% asset growth thereafter, (2) a tangible common equity to
tangible assets threshold of 7.0%, (3) pre-tax cost of cash of 1.5%, and (4) a marginal tax rate of 35.0%. Based on these
assumptions, the projected after-tax cash flows were: $5.8 million for the second half of 2016; $11.8 million in 2017; $12.3 million
in 2018; $12.8 million in 2019; and $13.2 million in 2020. This information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure,
and actual results may differ materially from these projected amounts.

Stockholder Support Agreements with Directors and Another Principal Stockholder of Merchants

Community Bank System has entered into a stockholder support agreement with each director of Merchants and another
principal stockholder of Merchants with voting power with respect to an aggregate of 739,146 shares of Merchants common stock,
or approximately 11% of the shares of Merchants common stock outstanding as of the record date. Pursuant to the agreements, each
director and the principal stockholder of Merchants have agreed to vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement all of the
shares of Merchants common stock that they are entitled to vote.

Interests of Merchants Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendation of the Merchants board of directors with respect to its approval of the Merger Agreement,
Merchants stockholders should be aware that certain of Merchants’ directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger
that are different from, or in addition to, those of Merchants stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of
interest. The Merchants board of directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in reaching its
decision to approve, and declare advisable, the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement. The material interests are summarized below.

Effect of the Merger Agreement on Equity Awards

In connection with the Merger, the Merchants’ equity awards held by Merchants’ directors and executive officers will be treated
the same as all outstanding Merchants’ equity awards, except as noted below under the header titled “Equity Awards of Certain
Directors and Executive Officers”.

Cash Payment for Outstanding Merchants Stock Options.  Consistent with the terms of Merchants’ 2008 Stock Incentive Plan,
the Merger Agreement provides that, at the effective time of the Merger, each Merchants stock option outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, whether or not vested or exercisable, will be cancelled and automatically
converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the aggregate number of shares of Merchants common stock subject to
such option multiplied by the excess of the value of the mixed election consideration over the exercise price of such option.

Vesting of Merchants Restricted Stock Awards.  Consistent with the terms of Merchants’ 2008 Stock Incentive Plan, the Merger
Agreement provides that, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Merchants common stock subject to vesting or forfeiture restrictions and granted under any Merchants benefit plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether or not vested, will automatically vest in full, and any restrictions
thereon will lapse, and such Merchants restricted share shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount of cash
equal to the value of the mixed election consideration plus dividends, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the effective time with
respect to such restricted share.

Treatment of Merchants Warrants.  Each organizers’ warrant to purchase Merchants common stock outstanding as of the
effective time will be converted at the effective time into a warrant to acquire, upon payment of the amount determined by dividing
the per share exercise price immediately prior to the effective time by the stock election consideration of 0.9630, the number of
shares of Community Bank System common stock determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Merchants common stock
which may be acquired upon exercise of such organizers’ warrant immediately prior to the effective time by (ii) the stock election
consideration of 0.9630. As of January 15, 2017, Don Chase held organizers’ warrants for 1,208 shares with an exercise price of
$41.39 per share.

Equity Awards of Certain Directors and Executive Officers

For certain executive officers, Merchants accelerated the vesting of outstanding equity awards that would otherwise have vested
at the effective time of the Merger, so that such awards vested in December 2016 in order to mitigate the impact of Section 4999 of
the Code, as discussed in more detail below. In connection with such acceleration, each executive officer agreed to (i) hold such
accelerated shares through the earlier of his or her termination of employment with Merchants or the closing of the Merger and (ii)
repay to Merchants an amount, in cash, equal to the compensation recognized by such executive officer, less applicable
employment and income taxes, for the accelerated shares should he or she terminate employment prior to closing of the Merger.

Outstanding stock options held by Mr. Tuttle were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2016 if they had not been exercised as
of such date. Due to the pendency of the Merger, Merchants extended the exercise period with respect to Mr. Tuttle’s stock options
until the earlier of (i) the closing of the Merger, and (ii) the original expiration date of the options. As of January 15, 2017, Mr.
Tuttle held options to purchase 26,520 shares of Merchants stock with a weighted average exercise price of $22.50.

Retention Incentives for Executive Officers

In order to incentivize and motivate certain executives who are not expected to be retained on a long-term basis following the
closing of the Merger to provide critical services during the pendency of the Merger, Community Bank System has entered into
retention agreements with each of Messrs. Cataldo and Watson and Mses. Thresher, Abbott, and Dragon. Under these retention
agreements, an amount equal to 40% of the executive’s 2016 base salary (or 50% of base salary, in the case of Ms. Thresher) will
become payable upon the closing of the Merger, subject to the executive’s continued service through the closing of the Merger and
completion of certain activities and other items prior to the closing of the Merger related to the integration of Merchants with
Community Bank System. In the event that the retention bonus (together with any other payments to the executive officers) would
constitute a “parachute payment” and would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of Code, such amounts would be
reduced to the largest payment possible without the imposition of an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.

In addition, for performance in 2016, Merchants granted restricted stock awards under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan in early
2017 to these executive officers (the “2017 Restricted Stock Awards”). The value of each restricted stock award was approximately
15% of each executive officer’s respective 2017 base salary and has terms and conditions consistent with Merchants’ past practice,
which include three-year cliff vesting subject to acceleration upon a change in control of Merchants, including as a result of the
Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Quantification of Equity Acceleration and Retention Incentives

The following table quantifies the payments and benefits that Merchants’ executive officers may receive in connection with the
Merger due to the accelerated vesting of unvested restricted shares held as of January 15, 2017 and the payment of retention
incentives. As of January 15, 2017, none of Merchants’ executive officers held any stock options and none of Merchants’ directors
held unvested restricted shares or unvested stock options or had received, or were expected to receive, any retention incentives.

(1) Amounts based upon multiplying the number of shares of restricted stock held by the executive officer by $42.80 (the average
closing price of a share of Merchants stock over the first five business days following the public announcement of the Merger).

(2) As discussed above in “Equity Awards of Certain Directors and Executive Officers”, Merchants accelerated the restricted stock
held by certain executive officers as of December 27, 2016 in order to mitigate the impact of Section 4999 of the Code.
Accordingly, the value of the stock recognized upon such acceleration by each such executive is as follows: Ms.
Abbott — $47,862; Mr. Cataldo — $18,622; Ms. Dragon — $79,660; Ms. Thresher — $173,260; and Mr. Watson — $47,862.
The value is based upon the closing price of a share of Merchants stock of $54.45 as of December 27, 2016. In accordance with
the terms of the applicable restricted stock agreements, Merchants withheld a number of shares upon vesting in order to satisfy
the minimum tax withholding due. Accordingly, the actual number of shares to be exchanged in the merger by each executive is
less than the number of shares set forth in the table above and the amount ultimately recognized in the merger by each executive
may be more or less than the amount recognized upon the acceleration.

(3) Amounts reflect the actual value of the 2017 Restricted Stock Award granted on January 18, 2017 (calculated as a percentage of
each executive officer’s current base salary). The number of shares subject to the 2017 Restricted Stock Awards granted to each
executive is as follows: Ms. Abbott — 474 shares; Mr. Cataldo — 451 shares; Ms. Dragon — 448 shares; Ms. Thresher — 904
shares; and Mr. Watson — 507 shares. The actual value the executive officers may receive in the Merger with respect to such
2017 Restricted Stock Award may be more or less than this amount depending upon the difference between the value of
Merchants stock as of January 18, 2017 and the actual per share merger consideration.

Severance Arrangements with Merchants

Merchants has an existing employment agreement with each of its executive officers (other than Richard Donovan and Eric
Segal), which provides that if, within 24 months following a change in control, an executive is terminated without cause or resigns
for good reason, the executive will be paid a lump sum amount equal to the sum of (i) a prorated bonus and (ii) three times (for Mr.
Hesslink) or two times (for the other executives) the executive’s then-current base salary. Furthermore, Merchants will continue to
pay its share of the cost of health insurance for the executive for up to 18 months following such termination. The prorated bonus
portion of the cash severance shall be calculated as the amount payable under Merchants’ annual incentive compensation plan
based on the extent to which the applicable performance criteria for the year of termination of employment have been achieved, as
measured through the end of the most recently

TABLE OF CONTENTS

completed calendar quarter, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days the executive was
employed by Merchants in the year of termination of employment and the denominator of which shall be 365.

In the event that any payments to the executive officers would constitute a “parachute payment” and would be subject to the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, such amounts would be reduced to the largest payment possible without the
imposition of an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. As noted above, Merchants has accelerated the vesting of certain
equity awards that would otherwise have vested at the effective time of the Merger, so that such awards vested in December 2016
in order to mitigate the impact of Section 4999 of the Code.

In December 2016, Merchants entered into an employment agreement with Richard Donovan as interim Principal Accounting
Officer, interim Principal Financial Officer, and interim Treasurer. The employment agreement provides that Mr. Donovan’s
employment will automatically terminate upon the closing of the Merger. If Mr. Donovan’s employment is terminated without
cause prior to the closing of the Merger, he shall receive the base salary he otherwise would have received had he remained
employed until the earliest of (1) the end of the 90 day period following his termination date, (2) the closing of the Merger, or (3)
the date that Merchants determines to be the end of the merger process. Mr. Donovan could receive severance in the form of base
salary continuation for up to 90 days, or approximately $56,250.

As described below, Community Bank System has entered into employment agreements with each of Messrs. Hesslink and
Bernier, and Ms. Bourgeois, which agreements will become effective upon the closing of the Merger and will supersede the
employment agreements each executive is currently party to with Merchants.

Community Bank System has confirmed its intention to honor the terms of the employment agreements with Messrs. Cataldo
and Watson and Mses. Thresher, Abbott, and Dragon. Community Bank System further acknowledged that these executive officers
would have good reason to resign following the closing of the Merger. The following table quantifies the potential payments and
benefits that these executive officers may receive under their employment agreements, assuming a termination without cause or
resignation for good reason following the Merger. As noted above, such amounts may be subject to reduction to the extent
necessary to avoid the imposition of an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.

assuming a termination of employment on January 15, 2017. Because the actual termination date is expected to occur on or
following the effective time of the Merger, which is expected to occur in late second quarter or early third quarter of 2017, the
actual prorated bonus may be more than this amount.

New Employment Agreements with Community Bank System

Community Bank System entered into employment agreements with each of Messrs. Hesslink and Bernier, and Ms. Bourgeois,
which agreements will become effective upon the closing of the Merger and will supersede the employment agreements each
executive is currently party to with Merchants. Mr. Hesslink has accepted a position with Community Bank System as Regional
President, New England, Mr. Bernier has accepted a position with Community Bank System as Senior Lender for Vermont, and
Ms. Bourgeois has accepted a position with Community Bank System as the Vice President of Retail and Municipal Banking for
New England, in each case, effective upon and following the closing of the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Under the new agreements, each executive will receive a signing bonus payable upon the first payroll date following the
effective date of the Merger in the following amount: Mr. Hesslink, $1,281,000; Mr. Bernier, $500,000; and Ms. Bourgeois,
$360,000. Mr. Hesslink’s base salary will be $350,000 with target incentive compensation of 25% of base salary; Mr. Bernier’s
base salary will be $160,000 with target incentive compensation of 25% of base salary; and Ms. Bourgeois’ base salary will be
$160,000 with target incentive compensation of 20% of base salary. If the executive is terminated without cause or resigns for good
reason during the term of the employment agreement (which is two years for Mr. Bernier and Ms. Bourgeois, and three years for
Mr. Hesslink) or within 12 months after the term of the agreement expires (or 24 months for Mr. Hesslink), the executive will be
entitled to accelerated vesting of equity awards and severance in an amount equal to the sum of the executive’s base salary and
most recent bonus amount (or target bonus if no payment has yet been made or if such bonus was for a partial year). Upon a
termination for any reason other than for cause within two years after a change in control, Mr. Hesslink shall receive the greater of
(i) two times the sum of his base salary and any payments made under the management incentive plan in the previous 12 months, or
(ii) base salary plus expected payments to be made under the management incentive plan. The agreements contain restrictive
covenants, including non-solicitation and non-competition covenants.

In the event that any payments to the executive officers under the employment agreements (together with any other payments)
would constitute a “parachute payment” and would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, such amounts
would be reduced to the largest payment possible without the imposition of an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code unless
payment of the full amount despite payment of the excise tax would be a greater net amount.

Regulatory Requirements

Notwithstanding the foregoing, all payments and benefits under the Merchants plans and arrangements are subject to any
required regulatory approval or satisfaction of a condition in any regulatory approval, as applicable.

Director Deferred Compensation

Certain of Merchants’ directors have deferred compensation under Merchants’ director deferred compensation plans. All such
deferred compensation is fully vested. Community Bank System will honor the terms and obligations of Merchants’ director
deferred compensation plans, unless such plans are terminated prior to the effective time of the Merger by mutual agreement of
Merchants and Community Bank System.

Retained Directors

At the effective time of the Merger, Community Bank System will expand the size of its board of directors by two seats and
appoint two directors of Merchants to the board of directors of Community Bank System and Community Bank. Each appointed
director will qualify as an “Independent Outside Director” of Community Bank System under ISS Guidelines and will meet all
legal and regulatory requirements for serving on the board of directors of Community Bank System. One appointed director will be
appointed to the class of directors of Community Bank System with terms expiring at the second annual meeting of stockholders
occurring after the effective time of the Merger and the other appointed director will be appointed to the class of directors of
Community Bank System with terms expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders occurring after the effective time of the
Merger. It is currently expected that Jeffrey L. Davis and Raymond C. Pecor III will be the members of the Merchants board of
directors who will be appointed to the board of directors Community Bank System.

Indemnification

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Community Bank System has agreed that it will, from and after the effective time of the
Merger, indemnify and hold harmless the present and former directors, officers and employees of Merchants and its subsidiaries
against any costs or expenses, judgments, settlements effected with the prior written consent of Community Bank System, fines,
losses, taxes, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising before or
after the effective time of the Merger, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of Merchants or its subsidiaries, or otherwise in connection with any action taken or not

taken at the request of Merchants or its subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of Merchants or its subsidiaries as a director,
officer employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at
or prior to the effective time of the Merger, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Community Bank
System has also agreed to advance expenses as incurred by any indemnified party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law
within thirty days after a written request setting forth such expenses in reasonable detail, provided that such indemnified party to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately decided that such indemnified party
is not entitled to indemnification.

Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

Community Bank System has further agreed that for a period of six years after the effective time of the Merger, it will cause to
be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Merchants with respect to
claims against them arising from matters, acts or omissions occurring at or before the effective time of the Merger (including the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement). Community Bank System will not be obligated to expend, on an annual
basis, an amount in excess of three hundred percent of the current annual premium paid as of the date of the Merger Agreement by
Merchants for such directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (the “premium cap”) and if such premiums at any time exceed the
premium cap, then Community Bank System shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which will provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to the premium cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Merchants in consultation with
Community Bank System may obtain at or prior to the effective time a substitute policy for a price that in the aggregate does not
exceed the premium cap.

Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Merchants’ Named Executive Officers

The table below sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation that is based
on or otherwise relates to the Merger for Merchants’ named executive officers who are receiving compensation relating to the
Merger, assuming that (i) a change of control of Merchants occurred on January 15, 2017, the latest practicable date prior to the
filing of this proxy/prospectus, (ii) the price per share of Merchants common stock is $42.80 (the average closing market price of
Merchants’ common stock on NASDAQ over the first five business days following the October 24, 2016 public announcement of
the Merger Agreement), (iii) the named executive officer’s base salary rates and annual target bonuses remain unchanged from
those in place as of such date, and (iv) no named executive officer receives any additional equity grants on or prior to the effective
time of the Merger other than the 2017 Restricted Stock Grant to Ms. Thresher as described above under “Retention Incentives for
Executive Officers”. Amounts set forth in the table may be subject to reduction to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of an
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.

As described above, Merchants has entered into employment agreements with Mr. Hesslink and Ms. Thresher. At the time of
the execution of the merger agreement, Mr. Hesslink entered into a new employment agreement with Community Bank System that
will supersede his existing employment agreement with Merchants effective upon the closing of the Merger. Ms. Thresher remains
subject to her employment agreement with Merchants. For Mr. Hesslink, the table presents the terms of his new employment
agreement with Community Bank System and assumes he will not be terminated and will be employed by Community Bank
System following the closing of the merger. For Ms. Thresher, it is assumed that she is terminated without cause or resigns for good
reason immediately following the closing of the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(1) Amount equals the total cash severance upon a qualifying termination of employment. The cash severance payment is “double-
trigger” (i.e., it is contingent upon a qualifying termination of employment following the effective time of the Merger). The
severance amount will be paid in a lump sum. For purposes of this table, the prorated bonus portion of the severance was
calculated based upon target bonus opportunity, and assuming a termination of employment on January 15, 2017. Because the
actual termination date is expected to occur on or following the effective time of the Merger, which is expected to occur in late
second quarter or early third quarter of 2017, the actual prorated bonus may be less than this amount.

(2) Amount equals the value of the single-trigger vesting for the unvested equity held by the executive upon the consummation of
the Merger. The value is based upon a price per share of $42.80, which is the average closing price of Merchants stock on
NASDAQ over the first five business days following the public announcement of the Merger Agreement. For Ms. Thresher, the
amount includes the value of the 2017 Restricted Stock Award awarded in 2017. For a discussion of the treatment of unvested
equity and the assumptions with respect to such 2017 Restricted Stock Award, see “Retention Incentives for Executive Officers”
above.

(3) Amount equals the signing bonus that Mr. Hesslink will receive from Community Bank System and the cash retention bonus
that Ms. Thresher will receive from Community Bank System upon the closing of the Merger. Each such payment will be paid
in a lump sum.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following discussion, subject to the limitations and qualifications described herein, insofar as it presents legal conclusions
with respect to matters of U.S. federal income tax law, constitutes the opinion of Goodwin Procter as to the material U.S. federal
income tax consequences to U.S. holders of Merchants common stock that exchange their shares of Merchants common stock in
the Merger, and is based on, and subject to, the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, existing
interpretations, court decisions, and administrative rulings, all of which are in effect as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the
continuing validity of the discussion.

This summary only addresses the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to the Merchants stockholders
that hold Merchants common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This summary does not
address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to Merchants stockholders in light of their particular
circumstances or to Merchants stockholders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law, such as:

• stockholders who are not U.S. holders;

• pass-through entities or investors in pass-through entities;

• financial institutions;

• insurance companies;

• tax-exempt organizations;

• brokers, banks or dealers in securities or currencies;

• traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting;

• persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

• persons who purchased or sell their shares of Merchants common stock as part of a wash sale;

• stockholders who hold their shares of Merchants common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion
transaction; and

• stockholders who acquired their shares of Merchants common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or
otherwise acquired shares as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In addition, the discussion does not address any alternative minimum tax or any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the
Merger, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the
Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

U.S. Holders

For purposes of this summary, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial holder of Merchants common stock that is:

• a citizen or resident of the U.S.; or

• a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under
the laws of the U.S. or any of its political subdivisions; or

• an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.

If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) holds Merchants common stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the
partners and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and partners in such a partnership should consult their tax advisers about
the tax consequences of the Merger to them.

The Merger

It is a condition to Merchants’ obligation to complete the Merger that Merchants receive an opinion from Goodwin Procter,
dated as of the closing date of the Merger, to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. It is a condition to Community Bank System’s obligation to complete the Merger that Community
Bank System receive an opinion from Cadwalader, dated as of the closing date of the Merger, to the effect that the Merger will
qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In addition, in connection with the filing of the
registration statement of which this document is a part, Goodwin Procter has delivered an opinion to Merchants to the same effect
as the opinion described above. These opinions will be based on representation letters provided by Merchants and Community
Bank System and on customary factual assumptions. None of the opinions described above will be binding on the Internal Revenue
Service. Merchants and Community Bank System have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
regarding any matters relating to the Merger, and as a result, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not
assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth below. In addition, if any of the
representations or assumptions upon which those opinions are based are inconsistent with the actual facts, the United States federal
income tax consequences of the Merger could be adversely affected. Based on factual representations contained in the
representation letters provided by Merchants and Community Bank System, and on certain customary factual assumptions, all of
which representations and assumptions must continue to be true and accurate as of the effective time of the Merger, in the opinion
of Goodwin Procter, the Merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

The tax consequences of the Merger to a U.S. holder of Merchants common stock will generally depend upon the form of
consideration such U.S. holder receives in the Merger.

Exchange for Solely Community Bank System Common Stock.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon exchanging all of
your shares of Merchants common stock for solely Community Bank System common stock (and cash instead of fractional shares
of Community Bank System common stock), you will generally not recognize gain or loss, except with respect to cash received
instead of fractional shares of Community Bank System common stock (see “Cash Instead of Fractional Shares” below).

Exchange for Solely Cash.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon exchanging all of your shares of Merchants common stock
for solely cash, you will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash you receive and your
cost basis in your Merchants common stock.

Exchange for Community Bank System Common Stock and Cash.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon exchanging all of
your shares of Merchants common stock for a combination of Community Bank System common stock and cash, you will
generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of: (1) the amount of cash treated as received in exchange
for Merchants common stock in the Merger

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(excluding any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Community Bank System common stock); and (2) the excess, if any, of
(a) the sum of the amount of cash treated as received in exchange for Merchants common stock in the Merger (excluding any cash
received in lieu of fractional shares of Community Bank System common stock) plus the fair market value of Community Bank
System common stock (including the fair market value of any fractional share) received in the Merger, over (b) your cost basis in
the Merchants common stock exchanged. If you acquired different blocks of Merchants common stock at different times or at
different prices, you should consult your individual tax advisor regarding the manner in which gain or loss should be determined.

Except as described in the section entitled “Dividend Treatment” below, any recognized gain will generally be long-term capital
gain if, as of the effective date of the Merger, your holding period with respect to the surrendered Merchants common stock
exceeds one year. The aggregate tax basis of the Community Bank System common stock you receive as a result of the Merger
(including any fractional shares of Community Bank System common stock deemed received) will be the same as your aggregate
tax basis in Merchants common stock you surrender in the Merger, decreased by the amount of cash you receive that is treated as
received in exchange for Merchants common stock (excluding any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Community Bank
System common stock) and increased by the amount of gain, if any, you recognize in the exchange (excluding any gain resulting
from cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Community Bank System common stock). The holding period of the Community
Bank System common stock you receive as a result of the exchange will include the holding period of Merchants common stock
you surrendered in the Merger.

Cash Instead of Fractional Shares.  If you receive cash in the Merger instead of a fractional share interest in Community Bank
System common stock, you will be treated as having received such fractional share in the Merger, and then as having received cash
in exchange for such fractional share. Gain or loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of
cash received and your adjusted tax basis allocable to such fractional share. Except as described in the section entitled “Dividend
Treatment” below, this gain or loss will generally be a capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the
effective date of the Merger, you have held your shares of Merchants common stock for more than one year.

Dividend Treatment.  There are certain circumstances in which all or part of the gain you recognize will be treated as a dividend
rather than as capital gains. In general, this determination depends upon whether, and to what extent, the Merger reduces your
deemed percentage share ownership interest in Community Bank System. Because the possibility of dividend treatment depends
primarily upon your particular circumstances, including the application of certain constructive ownership rules, you should consult
your own tax advisor regarding the potential tax consequences of the Merger to you.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

In general, information reporting requirements may apply to the cash payments made to a U.S. holder in connection with the
Merger, unless an exemption applies. Backup withholding may be imposed on the above payments if a U.S. holder (1) fails to
provide a taxpayer identification number or appropriate certificates or (2) otherwise fails to comply with all applicable
requirements of the backup withholding rules.

Any amounts withheld from payments to a U.S. holder under the backup withholding rules are not an additional tax and will be
allowed as a refund or credit against the U.S. holder’s applicable U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required
information is furnished to the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of backup
withholding based on their particular circumstances and the availability and procedure for obtaining an exemption from backup
withholding.

The foregoing discussion is for general information purposes only and is not intended to be a complete analysis or
description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. The discussion does not address tax
consequences which may vary with, or are contingent on, your individual circumstances. Moreover, the discussion does not
address any non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the Merger. Accordingly, you are strongly
encouraged to consult with your own tax advisor as to the tax consequences of the Merger in your particular circumstances,
including the applicability and effect of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the alternative minimum tax and any state, local or foreign and
other tax laws and of changes in those laws.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger

The Merger will be accounted for as a “business combination,” as that term is used under generally accepted accounting
principles, for accounting and financial reporting purposes, with Community Bank System treated as the acquirer. Under the
acquisition method of accounting, the assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities (including executory contracts
and other commitments) of Merchants as of the effective time of the Merger will be recorded at their respective fair values and
added to those of Community Bank System. Any excess of purchase price over the fair values is recorded as goodwill.
Consolidated financial statements of Community Bank System issued after the Merger would reflect these fair values and would
not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Merchants.

Restrictions on Sales of Community Bank System Common Stock by Certain Affiliates

The shares of Community Bank System common stock to be issued in the Merger will be freely transferable under the
Securities Act, except for shares issued to any stockholder who is an “affiliate” of Community Bank System as defined by Rule 144
under the Securities Act. Affiliates consist of individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control
with Community Bank System and include the executive officers and directors of Community Bank System and may include
significant stockholders of Community Bank System.

New York Stock Exchange Listing

Community Bank System has agreed to make an application to list the shares of its common stock to be issued in the Merger on
the NYSE. The stock must be authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, for the Merger to be
completed.

Regulatory Approvals and Notices for the Merger

Pursuant the Merger Agreement, Community Bank System will submit applications for all necessary regulatory approvals and
will give all requisite notices to governmental agencies regarding both the Merger and the Bank Merger. Certain approvals must be
obtained from, or other filings made with, various bank regulatory and other authorities, including the OCC, the Federal Reserve
Board, and state banking regulators.

The closing of the Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of all approvals of regulatory authorities required for the Merger and
the Bank Merger, the expiration of all notice periods and waiting periods after the grant of regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction
of all conditions contained in any regulatory approvals or consents.

The Comptroller of the Currency.  The Bank Merger is subject to approval by the OCC. Community Bank filed an application
on December 7, 2016. Following the OCC approval, the Bank Merger Act imposes a waiting period of up to 30 days after the OCC
approval in order to permit the United States Department of Justice to file any objections to the Bank Merger under the federal
antitrust laws. This waiting period may be reduced to 15 days if the Department of Justice has not provided any adverse comments
relating to the competitive factors of the transaction, which the parties expect to occur.

Federal Reserve Board.  The Federal Reserve Board is Community Bank System’s primary federal banking regulator. The
Merger is subject to approval by the Federal Reserve Board. Community Bank System filed an application with the Federal
Reserve Board on December 7, 2016 requesting approval of the Merger. In determining whether to approve the proposed
transaction, the Federal Reserve Board will consider factors such as financial and managerial resources, future prospects, the
convenience and needs to the community and competitive factors.

You should be aware that any governmental agency approval issued:

• reflects only the agency’s views that the transaction does not contravene applicable competitive standards imposed by law
and is consistent with regulatory requirements and policies; and

• is not an endorsement of or recommendation for the transaction.

Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights

Holders of shares of Merchants common stock who meet certain requirements are entitled to seek appraisal rights.

Under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the “DGCL,” holders of shares of Merchants common stock
who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section
262 of the DGCL (which we refer to as “Section 262”) will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and to receive payment in cash for the “fair value” of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, determined as described below.

Failure to follow precisely any of the statutory requirements could result in the loss of your appraisal rights.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified
in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus as Annex C. The following
summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation that Merchants stockholders
exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of Merchants common stock is entitled to
demand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock of
Merchants held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, fiduciary, depositary or other nominee, must act promptly
to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you
hold your shares of Merchants common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights,
you should consult with your broker, bank or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand
for appraisal by the nominee.

Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not
less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders as of the record date that appraisal rights are available,
and must include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall constitute such notice, and the full text
of Section 262 is attached to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of
Merchants common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should
review the following discussion and Annex C carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures
specified may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right
to seek appraisal of shares of common stock, Merchants believes that if a stockholder is considering exercising such rights such
stockholder should consider seeking legal and financial advice.

Filing Written Demand

Any holder of shares of Merchants common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Merchants, before the
vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Merchants special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of the
stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder must not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A holder of shares of
Merchants common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold the shares of record on the date the written demand for
appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time of the Merger. A proxy that is submitted
and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and will
constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal.
Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing
instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
Voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement will not by itself constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The
written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement.
The demand must reasonably inform Merchants of the identity of the holder, as well as the intention of the holder to demand an

TABLE OF CONTENTS

appraisal of the “fair value” of the shares held by the holder. A stockholder’s failure to deliver the written demand prior to the
taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Merchants special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal
rights.

Only a holder of record of shares of Merchants common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in
that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Merchants common stock should be executed by or on behalf of
the holder of record. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution
of the demand should be made in that capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy
and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an
agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must
identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record
owner or owners. Stockholders who hold their shares in bank, brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise
appraisal rights are urged to consult with their bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the
making of a demand for appraisal by such nominee.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be delivered to the Corporate Secretary of Merchants at
Merchants Bancshares, Inc., 275 Kennedy Drive, South Burlington, Vermont 05403.

Any holder of shares of Merchants common stock who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding
as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger
Agreement by delivering to the surviving corporation of the Merger a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal and an
acceptance of the Merger; however, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective date of
the Merger will require written approval of the surviving corporation of the Merger. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court
of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned
upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, that this restriction will not affect the right of any former
Merchants stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw
such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective date of the
Merger.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation

If the Merger is completed, within ten days after the effective time of the Merger, the surviving corporation of the Merger will
notify each holder of shares of Merchants common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262,
and who has not voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of the Merger Agreement, that the Merger has become effective and
the effective date thereof.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

Within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation of the Merger or any holder
of shares of Merchants common stock who has so complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262
may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all holders
who have properly demanded appraisal of their shares. The surviving corporation of the Merger is under no obligation to file a
petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of Merchants common stock. Community Bank System,
which will be the surviving corporation of the Merger, has no present intention to, and holders of Merchants common stock should
assume that Community Bank System will not, file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of shares of
Merchants common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of Merchants common stock who desire to have their shares
appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of Merchants common stock within
the time prescribed in Section 262.

Within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger, any holder of shares of Merchants common stock who has complied
with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving
corporation of the Merger a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Merchants common stock not voted in favor
of the adoption of the merger and with respect to which

TABLE OF CONTENTS

demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The statement must be mailed to the
stockholder within ten days after a written request therefor has been received by the surviving corporation of the Merger or within
ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares
held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking
appraisal or request the foregoing statement. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder
of record.

If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a holder of shares of Merchants common stock and a copy thereof is served upon
the surviving corporation of the Merger, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days of service to file with the
Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded
appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice is provided
to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to
determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder.
The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock
certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceeding, and if any stockholder
fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.

Judicial Determination of Fair Value

After determining the holders of shares of Merchants common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
appraise the “fair value” of their shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors.

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the “fair value” of their shares as so determined could be more
than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal
of their shares. Although the parties to the Merger Agreement believe that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is
made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and Merchants
stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as,
the value of the merger consideration. Stockholders should be aware that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not
otherwise address, fair value under Section 262. Neither Merchants nor Community Bank System anticipate offering more than the
merger consideration to any Merchants stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Merchants and Community Bank
System reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of
Merchants common stock is less than the value of the merger consideration, and that the methods that are generally considered
acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court should be considered in the appraisal proceedings. If a
petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the action (which do not include
attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the
parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. The Delaware Court of Chancery may also
order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.

Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger
through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Merchants common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the Merger into the right to receive the
merger consideration applicable to such shares. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or lose or withdraw, the holder’s right to appraisal
if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the Merger or if the stockholder delivers to the
surviving corporation of the Merger a written withdrawal of the holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the merger
consideration in accordance with Section 262.

From and after the effective time of the Merger, no dissenting stockholder shall have any rights of a stockholder of Merchants
with respect to that holder’s shares for any purpose, except to receive payment of fair value and to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions on the holder’s shares of Merchants common stock, if any, payable to Merchants stockholders of record as of a
time prior to the effective time of the Merger; provided, however, that if a dissenting stockholder delivers to the surviving
corporation of the Merger a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal within 60 days after the effective time of the Merger
and acceptance of the Merger, or subsequently with the written approval of the surviving corporation of the Merger, then the right
of that dissenting stockholder to an appraisal will cease and the dissenting stockholder will be entitled to receive the merger
consideration in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court
of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any former Merchants stockholder without the approval
of the court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just; provided, that such restriction shall
not affect the right of any former Merchants stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined the proceeding
as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after
the effective time of the Merger.

Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory
appraisal rights. Consequently, any Merchants stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is urged to consult legal and
financial advisors before attempting to exercise those rights.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. This summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is included as Annex A to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus and is incorporated
herein by reference. You should read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the legal document governing the
Merger.

The Merger and the Bank Merger

The boards of directors of Community Bank System and Merchants have each unanimously approved and adopted the Merger
Agreement, which provides for the merger of Merchants with and into Community Bank System, with Community Bank System as
the surviving company in the Merger.

The Merger Agreement also provides that, unless otherwise determined by Community Bank System in its sole discretion,
immediately after the effective time of the Merger, Merchants Bank, a Vermont-based commercial bank and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Merchants, will merge with and into Community Bank, a national banking association and wholly-owned subsidiary
of Community Bank System, with Community Bank as the surviving bank of such merger. The terms and conditions of the merger
of Merchants Bank and Community Bank are set forth in a separate plan of merger and merger agreement, the form of which is
attached as Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement, included as Annex A to this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. We refer to the merger of
Merchants Bank and Community Bank as the “Bank Merger.”

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

The closing of the Merger will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date which shall be no later than three
business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions to completion of the
Merger (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Community Bank System and Merchants. Simultaneously
with the closing of the Merger, Community Bank System and Merchants will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware. The Merger will become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is filed or such other time as
may be specified in the certificate of merger.

We currently expect that the Merger will be completed in late second quarter or early third quarter of 2017, subject to the
adoption of the Merger Agreement by Merchants stockholders, regulatory approvals, and other conditions. However, completion of
the Merger could be delayed if there is a delay in satisfying any other conditions to the Merger. No assurance is made as to whether,
or when, Community Bank System and Merchants will complete the Merger. See “— Conditions to Completion of the Merger” on
page 78 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Board of Directors

At the effective time of the Merger, Community Bank System and Community Bank will each expand the size of its board of
directors by two seats and appoint two directors of Merchants to serve on the boards of directors of Community Bank System and
Community Bank. The two directors have not been determined yet, but will be mutually agreed upon by Community Bank System
and Merchants. Each appointed director will qualify as an “Independent Outside Director” under ISS Guidelines and will meet all
legal and regulatory requirements for serving on the boards of directors of Community Bank System and Community Bank. With
respect to the Community Bank System board of directors, one appointed director will be appointed to the class of directors with
terms expiring at the second annual meeting of stockholders occurring after the effective time of the Merger and the other
appointed director will be appointed to the class of directors with terms expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders
occurring after the effective time of the Merger.

Merger Consideration

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Merchants common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger (excluding certain shares held by Merchants, Community Bank System and their wholly-owned
subsidiaries, which are referred to as “excluded shares,” and dissenting shares described below) will be converted into the right to
receive, at the election of the holder thereof

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(subject to the proration procedures described below): (a) the mixed election consideration, which is a combination of $12.00 in
cash and 0.6741 shares of Community Bank System common stock; (b) the cash election consideration of $40.00 in cash; or (c) the
stock election consideration of 0.9630 shares of Community Bank System common stock.

No fractional shares of Community Bank System common stock will be issued in connection with the Merger. Instead, each
Merchants stockholder who would otherwise receive a fractional share of Community Bank System common stock will receive a
cash payment, without interest, equal to: (i) the fractional share amount multiplied by (ii) the volume-weighted average trading
price per share of Community Bank System common stock on the NYSE during the 20 trading day period ending on and including
the third trading day immediately preceding the date of the closing of the Merger.

A Merchants stockholder also has the right to obtain the fair value of his or her shares of Merchants common stock in lieu of
receiving the merger consideration by strictly following the appraisal procedures under Section 262 of the DGCL, attached as
Annex C. Shares of Merchants common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and which are held
by a stockholder who does not vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and who properly demands the fair value of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies with, the appraisal procedures under the DGCL are referred to as “dissenting shares.” See “Proposal
I — The Merger — Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 58 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

If Community Bank System or Merchants changes the number of shares of Community Bank System common stock or
Merchants common stock outstanding prior to the effective time of the Merger as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or similar recapitalization with respect to the Community Bank
System common stock or Merchants common stock and the record date for such corporate action is prior to the effective time of the
Merger, then the merger consideration shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted.

Based upon the closing sale price of the Community Bank System common stock on the NYSE of $57.67 on February 2, 2017,
the last practicable trading date prior to the printing of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the value of the mixed election
consideration was approximately $50.88.

The value of the shares of Community Bank System common stock to be issued to Merchants stockholders in the Merger will
fluctuate between now and the closing date of the Merger. We make no assurances as to whether or when the Merger will be
completed, and you are advised to obtain current sale prices for the Community Bank System common stock. See “Risk
Factors — The value of the stock consideration will vary with changes in Community Bank System’s stock price” on page 15 of
this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Election and Proration Procedures

Election Materials and Procedures

An election form will be mailed to each holder of record of Merchants common stock as of the close of business on the fifth
business day prior to such mailing date (the “election form record date”), on a date to be mutually agreed by Community Bank
System and Merchants that is not more than 45 days nor less than 30 days prior to the anticipated closing date of the Merger or on
such other date as Community Bank System and Merchants mutually agree (the “mailing date”). Community Bank System will
make available one or more election forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who become holders or
beneficial owners of Merchants common stock between the election form record date and the close of business on the business day
prior to the 25th day following the mailing date (the “election deadline”).

Each election form will permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and
instructions) to specify (i) the number of shares of such holder’s Merchants common stock with respect to which such holder makes
a mixed election, (ii) the number of shares of such holder’s Merchants common stock with respect to which such holder makes a
cash election and (iii) the number of shares of such holder’s Merchants common stock with respect to which such holder makes a
stock election. Any shares of Merchants common stock with respect to which the exchange agent has not received an effective,
properly completed election form accompanied by related stock certificates or book-entry shares on

TABLE OF CONTENTS

or before the election deadline will be deemed to be “no election shares,” and the holders of such no election shares will be deemed
to have made a mixed election with respect to such no election shares.

Any election form may be revoked or changed by the authorized person properly submitting such election form, by written
notice received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline. In the event an election form is revoked prior to the election
deadline, the shares of Merchants common stock represented by such election form will become no election shares, except to the
extent a subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or all of such shares of Merchants common stock prior to the
election deadline. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the election form, the exchange agent will have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial
defects in the election forms, and any good faith decisions of the exchange agent regarding such matters shall be binding and
conclusive. None of Community Bank System, Merchants or the exchange agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person
of any defect in an election form.

Proration Procedures

A stockholder’s ability to elect to receive cash or shares of Community Bank System stock in exchange for shares of Merchants
common stock in the Merger is subject to proration procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement. These procedures are designed
to ensure that the total amount of cash paid, and the total number of shares of Community Bank System common stock issued, in
the Merger to the holders of shares of Merchants common stock, as a whole, will equal as nearly as practicable the total amount of
cash and number of shares that would have been paid and issued if all shares of Merchants common stock were converted into the
mixed election consideration.

Whether you receive the amount of cash and/or stock you request in your election form will depend in part on the elections of
other Merchants stockholders. You may not receive the form of consideration that you elect in the Merger, and you may instead
receive a pro-rata amount of cash and/or Community Bank System common stock.

The greater the oversubscription of the stock election, the less stock and more cash a Merchants stockholder making the stock
election will receive. Reciprocally, the greater the oversubscription of the cash election, the less cash and more stock a Merchants
stockholder making the cash election will receive. However, in no event will a Merchants stockholder who makes the cash election
or the stock election receive less cash and more shares of Community Bank System common stock, or fewer shares of Community
Bank System common stock and more cash, respectively, than a stockholder who makes the mixed election.

Set forth below are illustrative examples of how the proration and adjustment procedures will work in the event there is an
oversubscription of the cash election or the stock election.

Example A — Proration if Too Many Merchants Stockholders Elect to Receive All Cash. For purposes of this example, assume the
following:

• There are 6,883,644 outstanding shares of Merchants common stock.

• Merchants stockholders make a mixed election with respect to 688,364 shares (or 10%) of Merchants common stock.

• Merchants stockholders make a cash election with respect to 3,441,822 shares (or 50%) of Merchants common stock.

• Merchants stockholders make a stock election with respect to the remaining 2,753,458 shares (or 40%) of Merchants
common stock.

• There are no shares of Merchants common stock outstanding subject to vesting or forfeiture restrictions, and no dissenting
shares.

• You hold 1,000 shares of Merchants common stock and have made an effective cash election with respect to those shares.
In this example, proration would be required with respect to the Merchants stockholders who made a cash election.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Step 1.  Derive the cash election amount. The cash election amount equals the number of shares with respect to which cash
elections have been made multiplied by the cash election consideration of $40.00.

In this example, the cash election amount is calculated as follows:

3,441,822 * $40.00 = $137,672,880.00

Step 2.  Derive the available cash election amount. The available cash election amount equals (a) the product of $12.00
multiplied by the total number of shares of Merchants common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of the Merger, minus (b) the product of the total number of shares with respect to which a mixed election has been made multiplied
by $12.00, minus (c) the product of the total number of dissenting shares and shares of Merchants common stock subject to vesting
or forfeiture restrictions as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger multiplied by the value of the mixed election
consideration. The value of the mixed election consideration is equal to the sum of (i) $12.00 and (ii) the product of (a) 0.6741 and
(b) the volume-weighted average trading price of Community Bank System common stock on the NYSE during the 20 trading day
period ending on and including the third trading day immediately preceding the effective date of the Merger.

In this example, the available cash election amount is calculated as follows:

(6,883,644 * $12.00) – (688,364 * $12.00) = $74,343,360.00

Step 3.  Determine the pro rata cash consideration to be received by each share of Merchants common stock with respect to
which a cash election is made. The pro rata cash consideration is calculated by multiplying $40.00 by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the available cash election amount and the denominator of which is the cash election amount (such fraction, the “cash
fraction”).

In this example, the pro rata cash consideration is calculated as follows:

$40.00 *
$74,343,360.00

$137,672,880.00
 = $40.00 * 0.54 = $21.60

Step 4.  Determine the pro rata stock consideration to be received by each share of Merchants common stock with respect to
which a cash election is made. The pro rata stock consideration is a number of shares of Community Bank System common stock
equal to the stock election consideration of 0.9630 multiplied by one minus the cash fraction.

In this example, the pro rata stock consideration is calculated as follows:

0.9630 * (1 – 0.54) = 0.4430

Thus, in this example, if you own 1,000 shares of Merchants common stock and make a cash election with respect to those
shares, you would receive:

• $21,600 in cash; and

• 443 shares of Community Bank System common stock.

Example B — Proration if Too Many Merchants Stockholders Elect to Receive All Stock. For purposes of this example, assume the
following:

• There are 6,883,644 outstanding shares of Merchants common stock.

• Merchants stockholders make the mixed election with respect to 688,364 shares (or 10%) of Merchants common stock.

• Merchants stockholders make the cash election with respect to 688,364 shares (or 10%) of Merchants common stock.

• Merchants stockholders make the stock election with respect to the remaining 5,506,915 shares (or 80%) of Merchants
common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• There are no shares of Merchants common stock outstanding subject to vesting or forfeiture restrictions, and no dissenting
shares.

• You hold 1,000 shares of Merchants common stock and have made an effective stock election with respect to those shares.
In this example, proration would be required with respect to the Merchants stockholders who made a stock election.

Step 1.  Derive the cash election amount. In this example, the cash election amount is calculated as follows:

688,364 * $40.00 = $27,534,560.00

Step 2.  Derive the available cash election amount. In this example, the available cash election amount is calculated as follows:

(6,883,644 * $12.00) – (688,364 * $12.00) = $74,343,360.00

Step 3.  Determine the pro rata cash consideration to be received by each share of Merchants common stock with respect to
which a stock election is made. The pro rata cash consideration is calculated by dividing the difference between the available cash
election amount and the cash election amount by the number of Merchants shares with respect to which a stock election was made.

In this example, the pro rata cash consideration is calculated as follows:

  
$74,343,360.00 - $27,534,560.00

5,506,915
 = $8.50

Step 4.  Determine the pro rata stock consideration to be received by each share of Merchants common stock with respect to
which a stock election is made. The pro rata stock consideration is a number of shares of Community Bank System common stock
equal to the stock election consideration of 0.9630 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference between the
cash election consideration of $40.00, and $8.50 (the cash amount calculated in Step 3), and the denominator of which is the cash
election consideration of $40.00.

In this example, the pro rata stock consideration is calculated as follows:

0.9630 *
($40.00 – $8.50)

$40.00
 = 0.7584

Thus, in this example, if you own 1,000 shares of Merchants common stock and make a stock election with respect to those
shares, you would receive:

• $8,500 in cash; and

• 758 shares of Community Bank System common stock, plus cash in lieu of the additional 0.4 fractional share.

No Recommendation Regarding Elections

Neither Merchants nor Community Bank System is making any recommendation as to which merger consideration election a
Merchants stockholder should make. If you are a Merchants stockholder, you must make your own decision with respect to these
elections and may wish to seek the advice of your own attorneys or accountants.

Information About the Merger Consideration Elections

The mix of consideration payable to Merchants stockholders who make the cash election or the stock election will not be
known until the results of the elections made by Merchants stockholders are tallied, which will not occur until near or after the
closing of the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Procedures for Converting Shares of Merchants Common Stock into Merger Consideration

Exchange Agent

Prior to the effective time of the Merger, Community Bank System will designate a bank or trust company that is reasonably
acceptable to Merchants to act as the exchange agent in connection with the Merger (such agent is referred to in this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus as the “exchange agent”). The exchange agent shall also act as the agent for Merchants stockholders for the
purpose of receiving and holding their election forms and Merchants certificates and book-entry shares and shall obtain no rights or
interests in the shares represented thereby. At or prior to the closing of the Merger, Community Bank System will deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the exchange agent the aggregate amount of cash and number of shares of Community Bank System common
stock necessary to satisfy the aggregate merger consideration payable, and any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto.

Transmittal Materials and Procedures

Promptly (but not more than five business days) after the effective time of the Merger, Community Bank System will cause the
exchange agent to send transmittal materials, which will include the appropriate form of letter of transmittal, to holders of record of
shares of Merchants common stock (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) providing instructions on how to effect the
transfer and cancellation of shares of Merchants common stock in exchange for merger consideration.

After the effective time of the Merger, when a Merchants stockholder delivers a properly executed letter of transmittal and any
other documents as may reasonably be required by the exchange agent, the holder of shares of Merchants common stock will be
entitled to receive (i) the number of shares of Community Bank System common stock and an amount in cash that such holder is
entitled to receive as a result of the Merger (after taking into account all of the shares of Merchants common stock held
immediately prior to the Merger by such holder, and such holder’s merger consideration election) and (ii) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and in respect of dividends or other distributions to which the holder is entitled.

No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon cancellation of shares of Merchants common stock. The shares
of Community Bank System common stock issued and cash amount paid in accordance with the Merger Agreement upon
conversion of the shares of Merchants common stock (including any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) will be deemed to have
been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Merchants common stock.

If any portion of the merger consideration is to be delivered to a person or entity other than the holder in whose name any
surrendered certificate is registered, it will be a condition of such exchange that (i) the certificate surrendered must be properly
endorsed or must be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (ii) the person or entity requesting such payment pays any transfer or
other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the merger consideration to a person or entity other than the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered or will establish to the satisfaction of Community Bank System that such tax has been paid or
is not required to be paid. Payment of the applicable merger consideration with respect to book-entry shares will only be made to
the person or entity in whose name such book-entry shares are registered. The shares of Community Bank System common stock
constituting the stock portion of the merger consideration may be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is
otherwise required by any applicable law.

Treatment of Merchants Equity Awards and Warrants

Each Merchants stock option outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, whether or not
vested or exercisable, will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the aggregate
number of Merchants shares subject to such option multiplied by the excess of the value of the mixed election consideration over
the exercise price of such option. The value of the mixed election consideration is equal to the sum of (i) $12.00 and (ii) the product
of (a) 0.6741 and (b) the volume-weighted average trading price of Community Bank System common stock on the NYSE during
the 20 trading day period ending on and including the third trading day immediately preceding the effective date of the Merger.

Each share of Merchants common stock subject to vesting or forfeiture restrictions and granted under any Merchants benefit
plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, whether or not vested, will

automatically vest in full, and any restrictions thereon will lapse, and such Merchants restricted share shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the value of the mixed election consideration plus dividends, if any,
accrued but unpaid as of the effective time with respect to such restricted share.

Each organizers’ warrant to purchase Merchants common stock outstanding as of the effective time will be converted at the
effective time into a warrant to acquire, upon payment of the amount determined by dividing the per share exercise price
immediately prior to the effective time by the stock election consideration of 0.9630, the number of shares of Community Bank
System common stock determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Merchants common stock which may be acquired
upon exercise of such organizers’ warrant immediately prior to the effective time by (ii) the stock election consideration of 0.9630.

Each 2013 warrant to purchase Merchants common stock outstanding as of the effective time will be converted into the right to
receive, at the holder’s election, either (i) a cash payment in cancellation of such 2013 warrant equal to the number of shares of
Merchants common stock which may be acquired upon exercise of such 2013 warrant multiplied by the excess, if any, of the cash
election consideration of $40.00 over the per share 2013 warrant exercise price immediately prior to the effective time or (ii) a
replacement 2013 warrant certificate issued by Community Bank System and representing the right to acquire prior to the
expiration date of the original 2013 warrant, upon payment of the amount determined by dividing the per share exercise price
immediately prior to the effective time by the stock election consideration of 0.9630, that number of shares of Community Bank
System common stock equal to the number of shares of Merchants common stock which may be acquired upon exercise of such
2013 warrant immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by the stock election consideration of 0.9630.

Conduct of Business Pending the Merger

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merchants agreed to certain restrictions on its activities until the effective time of the
Merger. In general, Merchants has agreed that, except as otherwise permitted by the Merger Agreement, or as required by
applicable law, it will:

• conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice;

• use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve intact its business organization, employees and advantageous
business relationships; and

• maintain its books, accounts and records in the usual manner on a basis consistent with that previously employed.

Each of Merchants and Community Bank System have agreed to take no action that would adversely affect or materially delay
the receipt of regulatory or governmental approvals required for the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the
timing of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement of which this Proxy Statement/Prospectus is a part, or to perform its
covenants and agreements or to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Community Bank System has agreed that except as otherwise permitted by the Merger Agreement or as required by applicable
law, it will not (i) amend any provision of its organizational documents in a manner that would adversely affect the economic
benefits of the Merger to the stockholders of Merchants or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or (ii) take any action or knowingly fail to take any action where such action or failure to act would reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

Merchants has also agreed that except as otherwise permitted by the Merger Agreement, as required by applicable law, or with
the prior written consent of Community Bank System (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) it will not:

• amend or propose to amend its organizational documents or any resolution or agreement concerning indemnification of its
directors or officers;

Regulatory Matters

This Proxy Statement/Prospectus forms part of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 which Community Bank System has filed
with the SEC. Each of Community Bank System and Merchants has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective as promptly as practicable after its filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective for as long
as necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Each of Community Bank System and
Merchants has agreed to furnish the other with all information concerning themselves, their subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of either
party or any of their respective subsidiaries to any governmental authority in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Community Bank System has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or “blue sky”
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and Merchants has agreed to
furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such action.

Community Bank System and Merchants have agreed to use all respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
in good faith, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable laws, to permit
the consummation of the Merger as promptly as practicable.

Community Bank System and Merchants each have the right to review and consult in advance on all the information relating to
such party which appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any governmental authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, provided that each party has agreed to act reasonably
and promptly in exercising the foregoing right. Community Bank System and Merchants will consult with each other with respect
to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and governmental authorities necessary

or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and each party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Each of Community
Bank System and Merchants has agreed to consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any governmental
authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and, to the extent permitted by such governmental
authority, Merchants will give Community Bank System and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences.

Additionally, each of Community Bank System and Merchants has agreed to cooperate fully with and furnish information to the
other party, and obtain all consents of, and give all notices to and make all filings with, all governmental authorities and other third
parties that may be or become necessary for the performance of its obligations under the Merger Agreement and the consummation
of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Further, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each of
Community Bank System and Merchants has agreed to promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication, whether in
writing or oral, from any governmental authority whose consent is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any required approval will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any approval will be materially delayed.

Further, each of Community Bank System and Merchants has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order by a governmental authority that
would restrain, prevent or delay the closing of the Merger.

In connection with seeking regulatory approval for the Merger, neither Community Bank System nor any of its subsidiaries is
required take, or agree to take, any actions, or to accept any restriction, requirement or condition, that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Community Bank System, Merchants and their
respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by Merchants or any of its
subsidiaries, or Community Bank System or any of its subsidiaries, of all or any material portion of the business or assets of
Merchants and its subsidiaries or Community Bank System and its subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole, or compel
Community Bank System or any of its subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of the business or
assets of Merchants and its subsidiaries or Community Bank System and its subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole.

NYSE Listing

Community Bank System has agreed to cause the shares of Community Bank System common stock to be issued to the holders
of Merchants common stock in the Merger to be authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to
the effective time of the Merger.

Merchants Debt

Community Bank System will execute and deliver at or prior to the effective time of the Merger any instruments required for
the due assumption of Merchants’ outstanding fixed and floating rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2034 and other
agreements to the extent reasonably required by the terms of such debentures. Merchants has agreed to take all actions reasonably
required by Community Bank System in order to facilitate Community Bank System’s assumption of the aforementioned
Merchants debentures.

Employee Matters

Under the Merger Agreement, with respect to employees of Merchants who are employed by Community Bank following the
Merger (each, a “continuing employee”), Community Bank will: (i) recognize service with Merchants prior to the Merger for
purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and level of benefits under its health, welfare, paid time off and severance plans, except
for pension benefit accrual purposes or to the extent that such recognition would result in duplication of benefits; (ii) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to waive pre-existing condition exclusions to the extent these exclusions were waived under the
analogous Merchants benefit plan; and (iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to recognize for purposes of annual deductible
and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses

paid by continuing employees in the calendar year in which the effective time of the Merger occurs. Further, during the 12 months
after the effective date of the Merger, Community Bank will make available to continuing employees and their dependents
employer-provided health coverage under Merchants plans or on the same basis as Community Bank provides such coverage to
similarly situated employees of Community Bank and its Subsidiaries, and Community Bank will provide COBRA coverage to
former Merchants employees.

Community Bank will honor employment agreements and severance arrangements of Merchants specified in a disclosure
schedule to the Merger Agreement, except to the extent such arrangements are superseded or terminated as of or following the
effective time of the Merger. In the event the employment of a continuing employee without an individual agreement is terminated
without cause during a specified period following the effective time of the Merger, Community Bank will provide certain severance
benefits based on length of service. Community Bank will honor the terms and obligations of Merchants director deferred
compensation plans, unless such plans are terminated prior to the effective time of the Merger by mutual agreement of Merchants
and Community Bank. Upon the request of Community Bank, prior to the effective time of the Merger Merchants will terminate,
continue or merge its benefit plans, other than employment agreements and severance arrangements specified in a disclosure
schedule to the Merger Agreement and its director deferred compensation plans.

The Merger Agreement does not amend or modify any benefit plan or limit the rights of Community Bank to amend, terminate
or otherwise modify any benefit plan.

Indemnification and Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

From and after the effective time of the Merger, Community Bank System has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the
present and former directors, officers and employees of Merchants and its subsidiaries against any costs or expenses, judgments,
settlements effected with the prior written consent of Community Bank System, fines, losses, taxes, damages or liabilities incurred
in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising before or after the effective time of the Merger,
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Merchants or
its subsidiaries, or otherwise in connection with any action taken or not taken at the request of Merchants or its subsidiaries or is or
was serving at the request of Merchants or its subsidiaries as a director, officer employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another
person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time of the Merger, including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Community Bank System has also agreed to advance expenses as incurred
by any indemnified party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law within 30 days after a written request setting forth such
expenses in reasonable detail, provided that such indemnified party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately decided that such indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification.

For a period of six years after the effective time of the Merger, Community Bank System will cause to be maintained in effect
the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Merchants with respect to claims against them
arising from matters, acts or omissions occurring at or before the effective time of the Merger (including the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement). Community Bank System will not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount
in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date of the Merger Agreement by Merchants for such directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance (the “premium cap”) and if such premiums at any time exceed the premium cap, then Community Bank
System shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which will provide the maximum coverage available at an annual
premium equal to the premium cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Merchants in consultation with Community Bank System may obtain
at or prior to the effective time a substitute policy for a price that in the aggregate does not exceed the premium cap.

No Solicitation

Merchants has agreed that it will not, and will cause its subsidiaries and its subsidiaries’ directors, officers, employees and
representatives and affiliates not to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries
or proposals with respect to, (ii) continue, engage or

TABLE OF CONTENTS

participate in any negotiations concerning, (iii) provide to any person any confidential or nonpublic information or data or have or
participate in any discussions with any person relating to, or (iv) approve, recommend, agree to or accept, any acquisition proposal.

An “acquisition proposal” is defined as any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i)
any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Merchants and its subsidiaries or 15%
or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Merchants or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of Merchants, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in a third party beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of Merchants or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the
consolidated assets of Merchants, or (iii) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving Merchants or any of its subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of Merchants.

If Merchants receives an unsolicited bona fide acquisition proposal that was not received in violation of the provisions
described above, and the Merchants board of directors concludes in good faith that such acquisition proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a superior proposal (as defined below) and that failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Merchants may, and may permit its directors, officers, employees and representatives
to: (i) enter into a confidentiality agreement with the third party making the acquisition proposal with terms and conditions no less
favorable to Merchants than the confidentiality agreement entered into by Merchants and Community Bank System prior to the
execution of the Merger Agreement; (ii) furnish non-public information or data to the third party making the acquisition proposal
pursuant to such confidentiality agreement (and provide to Community Bank System any information not previously provided to
Community Bank System); and (iii) participate in such negotiations or discussions with the third party making the acquisition
proposal regarding such proposal.

A “superior proposal” means any bona fide, unsolicited, written acquisition proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of Merchants common stock on terms that the Merchants board of directors concludes in good faith to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to its stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement (including taking into account the terms, if any, proposed by Community Bank System to amend or modify the terms of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in response to such proposal), (i) after receiving the advice of its financial
advisor, (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii) after
taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal),
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the above, Merchants (without any determination by its board of directors or consultation with outside counsel
or its financial advisor) may, following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide acquisition proposal, contact such third party solely in
order to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such acquisition proposal and/or to direct such third party to the Merger
Agreement.

Merchants must promptly advise Community Bank System within 24 hours following receipt of any acquisition proposal, any
request for information, discussion or negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates an acquisition proposal, or
any inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to, an acquisition proposal. Merchants must furnish a copy of, or a
description of the terms and conditions of such acquisition proposal and must keep Community Bank System informed of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations within 24 hours of any such event or occurrence. Merchants must also promptly
(within 24 hours) notify Community Bank System if it determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal and shall not provide such information or engage in such discussions prior to
providing such notice to Community Bank System.

The Merger Agreement generally prohibits Merchants’ board of directors from (i) withdrawing, modifying or qualifying in a
manner adverse to Community Bank System the approval, recommendation or declaration

of advisability by the Merchants board of directors set forth in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus that the Merchants stockholders
vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) recommending, endorsing or otherwise declaring as advisable the adoption of any
acquisition proposal, (iii) resolving, agreeing or proposing to take any such actions or (iv) submitting the Merger Agreement to
Merchants’ stockholders without recommendation, in each case prior to the date of the special meeting of stockholders (any such
action, an “adverse recommendation change”).

The Merchants board of directors may effect an adverse recommendation change in response to (i) an acquisition proposal that
constitutes a superior proposal, or (ii) an intervening event (as defined below), if the board of directors concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that the failure to effect
such adverse recommendation change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law.

An “intervening event” means any material event or development or material change in circumstance with respect to Merchants
that arises or occurs after the date of the Merger Agreement and was neither known by nor reasonably foreseeable to the Merchants
board of directors as of or prior to the date of the Merger Agreement and does not relate to any acquisition proposal or any required
regulatory approval.

In addition, solely in the case of a superior proposal that did not result from a breach by Merchants of its nonsolicitation
obligations under the Merger Agreement, the Merchants board of directors may cause Merchants to terminate the Merger
Agreement and authorize Merchants to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such superior proposal, if the board of
directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisor) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law,
provided that no such termination will be effective until Merchants pays to Community Bank System the termination fee of
$10,720,000.00. See “— Termination,” beginning on page 78 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus and “— Termination Fee”
beginning on page 80 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

The board of directors of Merchants may not effect an adverse recommendation change or terminate the Merger Agreement in
response to a superior proposal without providing Community Bank System with at least four business days’ prior written notice of
its intention to take such action and with a reasonably detailed description of the acquisition proposal or intervening event giving
rise to its determination to take such action, and without taking into account in good faith, at the end of such notice period, any
amendment or modification of the Merger Agreement proposed by Community Bank System and determining, after taking into
account the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, that failure to take such action
would nevertheless be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Merchants has further agreed to, and to cause its
financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Community Bank System in good faith (to the extent Community Bank System seeks
to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the Merger Agreement proposed by Community Bank System during such four business
day period. Any material amendment to any acquisition proposal or any material development with respect to any intervening
event, as the case may be, will require a new notice period as referred to above, except that any reference to four business days
shall instead be three business days.

If the Merchants board of directors effects an adverse recommendation change and Community Bank System determines to
terminate the Merger Agreement, Merchants will be required to pay Community Bank System a termination fee of $10,720,000 in
cash. See “— Termination,” beginning on page 78 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus and “— Termination Fee” beginning on page
80 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Notwithstanding any superior proposal, intervening event or anything contained in the Merger Agreement, unless the Merger
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Merchants special meeting shall be convened for the purpose of
submitting the Merger Agreement to the Merchants stockholders to vote on the adoption of such and any other matters
contemplated thereby.

• the inapplicability to the Merger of state takeover laws;

• material contracts;

• environmental matters;

• intellectual property;

• real and personal property;

• loan and investment portfolio matters;

• adequacy of allowances for losses;

• maintenance of insurance policies;

• privacy of customer information;

• technology systems;

• administration of trust accounts;

• liquidity of investment securities;

• receipt of a fairness opinion from its financial advisor; and

• transactions with insiders and affiliates.

Certain of the representations and warranties of Merchants and Community Bank System are qualified as to “materiality” or
“material adverse effect.” For purposes of the Merger Agreement, the term “material adverse effect” means, with respect to
Merchants or Community Bank System, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the financial condition, property,
business, assets (tangible or intangible), liabilities or results of operations of such party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii)
the ability of such party and its subsidiaries to perform their obligations under the Merger Agreement or to timely consummate the
Merger, the Bank Merger, or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that “material
adverse effect” does not include (x) for purposes of (i) above, (A) changes after the date of the Merger Agreement in GAAP or
regulatory accounting requirements generally applicable to banks and their holding companies, (B) changes after the date of the
Merger Agreement in laws, rules or regulations or interpretations of laws, rules or regulations by governmental authorities of
general applicability to banks and their holding companies, (C) changes after the date of the Merger Agreement in general
economic or market conditions in the United States or any state or territory thereof, in each case generally affecting banks and their
holding companies, (D) changes after the date of the Merger Agreement in market interest rates, (E) changes resulting from the
announcement or pendency of the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the impact
thereof on relationships with customers, service providers or partners) or actions or inactions expressly required by the Merger
Agreement, (F) changes resulting from any stockholder litigation, and (G) changes after the date of the Merger Agreement resulting
from any failure to meet internal projections or forecasts or estimates of revenues or earnings for any period (it being understood
that the circumstances giving rise to such failure that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of material adverse effect may
be taken into account in determining whether there has been a material adverse effect), except with respect to clauses (A), (B), (C)
and (D) to the extent that the effects of such changes are disproportionately adverse to the financial condition, property, business,
assets (tangible or intangible), liabilities or results of operations of such party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, as compared to
other banks and their holding companies; or (y) for purposes of (ii) above, the impact of actions and omissions of a party (or any of
its subsidiaries) taken with the prior informed written consent of the other party.

Regulation and/or the Massachusetts Division of Banks, and any other regulatory approval that is necessary to consummate

• the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement on the date of the Merger
Agreement and as of the closing date of the Merger (or such other date specified in the Merger Agreement) other than, in

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• by Community Bank System or Merchants if the Merger is not consummated by July 22, 2017; provided, that neither party
has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement if such party was in breach of its obligations under the Merger Agreement
and such breach was the cause of the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such date, and provided further that, if on
the expiration date all conditions to the Merger have been satisfied or waived or are capable of being satisfied by the closing
other than the condition relating to the receipt of required regulatory approvals, then either party has the right to extend the
expiration date by an additional three month period;

• by Community Bank System if any governmental authority has denied or rescinded any required regulatory approval or
imposed a materially burdensome regulatory condition on Community Bank System in connection with granting any
regulatory approval;

• by Community Bank System in the event that (i) the Merchants board of directors or any committee thereof has effected an
adverse recommendation change (see “— No Solicitation” beginning on page 73 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus), (ii)
Merchants has failed to comply in all material respects with its obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to
third party acquisition proposals or by failing to call, give notice of, convene and hold the special meeting; (iii) a tender
offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Merchants common stock is commenced and
Merchants shall not have sent to its stockholders, within ten business days after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer, a statement that the Merchants board of directors recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer, or
(iv) an acquisition proposal (other than a tender or exchange offer covered by clause (iii) above) with respect to Merchants
is publicly announced and, upon Community Bank System’s request, Merchants fails to issue a press release announcing its
opposition to such acquisition proposal and reaffirming the Merchants board of directors’ recommendation that Merchants
stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement within five business days after such request;

• by Merchants, if its board of directors so determines by a majority vote of the members of its entire board, at any time
during the five business day period commencing on the latest of the date, which is referred to as the determination date, on
which (i) all regulatory approvals have been received, and (ii) the approval of the merger agreement by the Merchants
stockholders is obtained, if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

º the volume-weighted average trading price of Community Bank System’s common stock on the NYSE for the 20 trading
days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the determination date is less than $35.77; and

º Community Bank System’s common stock underperforms a peer group index (the SNL Midcap U.S. Bank Index) by
more than 20%.

If the Merchants board of directors exercises the termination right described above, Community Bank System will have the
option to increase the amount of Community Bank System common stock to be provided to Merchants stockholders such
that the implied value of the exchange ratio would be equivalent to the minimum implied value that would have avoided
triggering the termination right described above. If Community Bank System elects to increase the exchange ratio pursuant
to the preceding sentence, no termination will occur.

• by Merchants, prior to the receipt of the approval of the Merger Agreement by Merchants stockholders, in order to accept a
superior proposal in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, provided that
Merchants shall substantially concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
superior proposal and that concurrently with or prior to such termination Merchants shall pay to Community Bank System
the termination fee of $10,720,000. See “— Termination Fee” below.

Amendment; Waiver

The Merger Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time. However, after adoption of the Merger Agreement by the
Merchants stockholders, no amendment of the Merger Agreement may be made which by law requires further approval of the
Merchants stockholders without obtaining that approval.

At any time prior to the effective time of the Merger, the parties may, to the extent legally allowed, waive or extend the time for
compliance or fulfillment of the obligations of the other party; and waive any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations
contained in the Merger Agreement on the part of the other party. A waiver must be in writing signed by a duly authorized officer.

Expenses

Regardless of whether the Merger is completed, all expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger, the
Merger Agreement and other transactions contemplated thereby will be paid by the party incurring the expenses, except that
Community Bank System and Merchants shall bear and pay 50% of all printing and mailing costs associated with this Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial information combines the historical
consolidated financial position and results of operations of Community Bank System and its subsidiaries and Merchants and its
subsidiaries, as an acquisition by Community Bank System of Merchants using the acquisition method of accounting and giving
effect to the related pro forma adjustments described in the accompanying notes. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the
assets and liabilities of Merchants will be recorded by Community Bank System at their respective fair values as of the date the
merger is completed. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information should be read in conjunction with Community
Bank System’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016, and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, which are incorporated in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus by reference, and Merchants’ Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016, and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015, which are incorporated in this Proxy Statement/Prospectus by reference. See “Where You Can Find More Information” on
page 104 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not
indicate the financial results of the combined company had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of each period
presented, nor the impact of possible business model changes. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
information also does not consider any potential effects of changes in market conditions on revenues, expense efficiencies, asset
dispositions, and share repurchases, among other factors. In addition, as explained in more detail in the accompanying notes
beginning on page 85 of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the preliminary allocation of the pro forma purchase price reflected in
the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial information is subject to adjustment and may vary
significantly from the actual purchase price allocation that will be recorded upon completion of the Merger.

The Merchants merger was announced on October 24, 2016 and provides that the stockholders of Merchants will have the
option to receive, at their election, consideration per share equal to (i) 0.9630 shares of Community Bank System common stock,
(ii) $40.00 in cash or (iii) the combination of 0.6741 shares of Community Bank System common stock and $12.00 in cash, with
both, (i) and (ii) subject to proration and adjustment procedures to ensure that the total amount of cash paid, and the total number of
shares of Community Bank System common stock issued in the Merger to Merchants stockholders, as a whole, will equal as nearly
as practicable to the total amount of cash and number of shares that would have been paid and issued if all of the Merchants
stockholders received the consideration in (iii). The cash and stock consideration would be equivalent to $44.02 for each share of
Merchants common stock based upon the closing price of Community Bank System common stock as of October 21, 2016, the last
trading day prior to the public announcement of the signing of the merger agreement. The transaction is intended to qualify as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet gives effect to the merger as if the transaction had occurred on
September 30, 2016. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed income statements for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 give effect to the merger as if the transaction had become effective on January 1,
2015.

Notes to the Combined Condensed Financial Statements

Note 1 — Basis of Presentation

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial information and notes have been prepared to illustrate the
effects of the merger transaction involving Community Bank System and Merchants using the acquisition method of accounting
with Community Bank System treated as the acquirer. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily indicate the financial results of the combined
companies had the companies actually been combined at the beginning of each period presented, nor does it necessarily indicate the
results of operations in future periods or the future financial position of the combined entities. Under the acquisition method of
accounting, the assets and liabilities of Merchants, as of the effective date of the merger, will be recorded by Community Bank
System at their respective fair values and the excess of the merger consideration over the fair value of the net assets will be
allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.

The Merchants merger is currently expected to close in late second quarter or early third quarter of 2017 and is subject to
customary closing conditions, including the approval by the stockholders of Merchants and required regulatory approvals. The
Merchants merger provides that the stockholders of Merchants will have the option to receive, at their election, consideration per
share equal to (i) 0.9630 shares of Community Bank System common stock, (ii) $40.00 in cash or (iii) the combination of 0.6741
shares of Community Bank System common stock and $12.00 in cash, with both, (i) and (ii) subject to proration and adjustment
procedures to ensure that the total amount of cash paid, and the total number of shares of Community Bank System common stock
issued in the Merger to Merchants stockholders, as a whole, will equal as nearly as practicable to the total amount of cash and
number of shares that would have been paid and issued if all of the Merchants stockholders received the consideration in (iii). The
cash and stock consideration would be equivalent to $44.02 for each share of Merchants common stock based upon the closing
price of Community Bank System common stock as of October 21, 2016, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of
the signing of the merger agreement. The transaction is intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

The pro forma allocation of purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
information is subject to adjustment and may vary from the actual purchase price allocation that will be recorded at the time the
merger transaction is completed. Adjustments may include, but not be limited to, changes in (i) Merchants’ balance sheet through
the effective date of the merger; (ii) the aggregate value of merger consideration paid if the price of Community Bank System’s
shares vary from the estimated price per share, which represents the closing share price of Community Bank System common
shares; (iii) total merger related expenses if consummation and/or implementation costs vary from currently estimated amounts; and
(iv) the underlying values of assets and liabilities if market conditions differ from current assumptions.

The accounting policies of Community Bank System and Merchants are in the process of being reviewed in detail. Upon
completion of such review, conforming adjustments or financial statement reclassification may be determined.

Note 2 — Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation

The pro forma adjustments include the estimated accounting entries to record the merger transaction under the acquisition
method of accounting for business combinations. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is
allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Estimated fair value adjustments included in the pro forma financial statements
are based upon available information and certain assumptions considered reasonable, and may be revised as additional information
becomes available. The purchase price is contingent on the Community Bank System price per common share at the date of close
of the transaction, which has not yet occurred.

Note 3 — Pro Forma Adjustments

The following pro forma adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated
financial information. All taxable adjustments were calculated using a 38.2% tax rate to arrive at deferred tax asset or liability
adjustments. All adjustments are based on current assumptions and valuations, which are subject to change.

A. Adjustments to cash to reflect the estimated cash of $83.2 million used to purchase Merchants and an additional $7.7 million
in after-tax merger costs associated with the Merchants transaction.

B. Adjustment to record Merchants held-to-maturity securities at fair value.

C. Adjustments to loans to reflect the estimated fair value adjustments to acquired loans of $13.1 million for net credit
deterioration based on historical loss factors and certain qualitative factors, an estimated write-up of $4.6 million related to
the difference in loan portfolio interest rates and current market interest rates, and the reversal of Merchants' allowance for
loan losses of $12.5 million. Prior to the completion of the Merchants transaction, Community Bank System will finalize its
determination of the fair values of the acquired loans which could significantly change from the amount and the composition
of the estimated fair value adjustments for acquired loans.

D. Adjustments to eliminate the Merchants goodwill of $7.0 million and record estimated goodwill of $172.5 million associated
with the Merchants transaction. The following depicts the sensitivity of the purchase price and resulting goodwill to changes
in Community Bank System’s common stock price.

E. Adjustments to eliminate Merchants core deposit intangible asset of $1.2 million and record estimated $20.4 million in core
deposit intangibles associated with the Merchants transaction.

F. Prior to the completion of the Merchants transaction, Community Bank System will obtain independent third party
appraisals of all significant premises and equipment owned by Merchants. Such appraisals could result in further
adjustments to the carrying values of the acquired premises and equipment.

G. Adjustment to Merchants time deposits of $0.3 million to reflect a current market rate of interest.

H. Adjustment to Merchants subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts of $5.1 million to reflect a current
market rate of interest.

I. Adjustment to Merchants long-term debt to reflect a current market rate of interest.

J. Adjustment to other liabilities to record a deferred tax liability of $7.8 million associated with the Merchants transaction
core deposit intangible asset adjustment.

K. Adjustments to eliminate Merchants common stock of $72,000 and record the issuance of 4.64 million Community Bank
System shares to Merchants stockholders.

Note 3 — Pro Forma Adjustments  – (continued)

N. Adjustment to eliminate Merchants accumulated other comprehensive loss of $2.3 million.

O. Adjustment to eliminate Merchants treasury stock balance of $13.4 million.

P. Adjustments to Community Bank System common shares outstanding to eliminate shares of Merchants common stock of
6.89 million and record Community Bank System share issues of 4.64 million for the Merchants transaction.

Q. Net adjustments to interest and fees on loans of $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2015 to record estimated amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on acquired
loans of Merchants using a weighted average maturity of approximately 9.7 years. The estimated amortization of premiums
and accretion of discounts on acquired loans of Merchants is approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2015, $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $0.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018, $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $2.5 million thereafter.

R. Prior to the completion of the Merchants transaction, Community Bank System will evaluate the subordinated debt held by
unconsolidated subsidiary trusts to finalize the necessary fair value adjustment to reflect current interest rates for similar
instruments. The fair value adjustment associated with the Merchants subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary
trusts will then be amortized into earnings as an increase in interest expense. This adjustment includes Community Bank
System’s estimate of the expected amortization of $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $0.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2015 based on the remaining term of the subordinated debt held by unconsolidated
subsidiary trusts. The estimated amortization of the fair value adjustment for subordinated debt held by unconsolidated
subsidiary trusts is approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, $0.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $0.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $4.1 million thereafter.

S. Prior to the completion of the Merchants transaction, Community Bank System will evaluate the assumed time deposits to
finalize the necessary fair value adjustment to reflect current interest rates for comparable deposits. The fair value
adjustment associated with Merchants time deposits will then be accreted into earnings as a reduction in the cost of such
time deposits. This adjustment includes Community Bank System’s estimate of the expected accretion of $0.3 million that
would be recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 using a weighted-average maturity of approximately one year.

T. Net adjustments to amortization of intangible assets of $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $4.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to eliminate Merchants core deposit intangible amortization and record
estimated amortization of core deposit intangible on acquired deposits from Merchants using the Sum of the Years Digit
method over an estimated eight year life. The estimated amortization of the core deposit intangible on acquired deposits
from Merchants is approximately $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, $4.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $2.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $3.4 million thereafter.

U. Adjustment to eliminate $0.5 million in acquisition expenses recorded on Merchants associated with the transaction with
Community Bank System.

Note 3 — Pro Forma Adjustments  – (continued)

V. Adjustment to income tax expense to record income tax effect of pro forma adjustments at the estimated statutory tax rate of
38.2%.

W. Adjustments to weighted-average Community Bank System common shares outstanding to eliminate Merchants common
stock outstanding and record Community Bank System common shares outstanding based on the total estimated Community
Bank System share issue of 4.64 million for the Merchants transaction. See Note 2 to unaudited pro forma combined
condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note 4 — Estimated Cost Savings and Merger Integration Costs

Community Bank System expects to realize approximately $10.6 million, or approximately 22.7% of Merchants’ noninterest
expense base, in annual pre-tax cost savings following the merger. Estimated cost savings is expected to be fully realized in fiscal
year 2018 and is excluded from this pro forma analysis.

Merger- and integration-related costs are not included in the pro forma combined statements of income since they will be
recorded in the combined results of income as they are incurred prior to, or after completion of, the merger and are not indicative of
what the historical results of the combined company would have been had the companies been actually combined during the
periods presented. Merger- and integration-related costs are estimated to be $12.5 million pre-tax for the Merchants transaction.

On February 2, 2017, the closing price of Community Bank System common stock reported on the NYSE was $57.67.

Community Bank System has historically paid regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock, and the board of directors
of Community Bank System presently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends, subject to the need for
those funds for other purposes. However, because substantially all of the funds available for the payment of dividends by
Community Bank System are derived from Community Bank, future dividends will depend upon the earnings of Community Bank,
its financial condition, its need for funds and applicable governmental policies and regulations. In addition, the indentures
pertaining to the subordinated junior debentures Community Bank System issued in connection with its trust preferred offerings
would generally restrict its ability to pay cash dividends if Community Bank System defers interest payments on the subordinated
junior debentures.

Merchants common stock, held of record by approximately 856 holders. On February 2, 2017, the closing price of Merchants
common stock reported on NASDAQ was $50.40.

Merchants has historically paid regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock, and the board of directors of Merchants
presently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends, subject to the need to use those funds for other
purposes. However, because substantially all of the funds available for the payment of dividends by Merchants are derived from
Merchants Bank, future dividends will depend upon the earnings of Merchants Bank, its financial condition, its need for funds and
applicable governmental policies and regulations. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, other than regular quarterly dividends
consistent with past practices, Merchants is not permitted to declare, set aside or pay any cash dividends while the Merger is still
pending.

The following table presents the closing price of a share of Community Bank System, as reported on the NYSE, and Merchants
common stock, as reported on NASDAQ, on October 21, 2016, the last full trading day prior to the public announcement of the
Merger, and on February 2, 2017, the last practicable trading day prior to the date of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The
following table also presents the equivalent per share value of the Community Bank System common stock that Merchants
stockholders would receive for each share of their Merchants common stock if the Merger was completed on those dates:

PROPOSAL II — MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

As required by Regulation 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Merchants is providing its stockholders
with the opportunity to cast an advisory, non-binding vote on the compensation that may become payable to its named executive
officers in connection with the completion of the Merger, as disclosed in the section of this Proxy Statement/Prospectus captioned
“The Merger — Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Merchants’ Named Executive Officers,” beginning on page 53, and
the related table and narratives. Merchants’ board of directors encourages you to review this information carefully.

Your vote is requested.  This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall
compensation that may become payable to Merchants’ named executive officers in connection with the completion of the Merger.
In addition, this vote is separate and independent from the vote of stockholders to approve the completion of the Merger. Merchants
asks that its stockholders vote “FOR” the following resolution:

RESOLVED, that the compensation that may become payable to Merchants’ named executive officers in connection with the
completion of the Merger, as disclosed in the section captioned “The Merger —  Interests of Merchants Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” (beginning on page 48 of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus dated February 7, 2017) and the related table
and narratives, is hereby APPROVED.

Approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. Additionally, this vote is advisory and, therefore, it
will not be binding on Merchants, nor will it overrule any prior decision or require Merchants’ board of directors (or any committee
thereof) to take any action. Merchants’ board of directors will consider the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the
matter “FOR” the foregoing resolution as advisory approval of the compensation that may become payable to Merchants’ named
executive officers in connection with the completion of the Merger.

MERCHANTS’ BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE
APPROVAL OF THE ADVISORY, NON-BINDING PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE MERGER-RELATED
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

PROPOSAL III — ADJOURNMENT OF THE MEETING

Merchants is also submitting a proposal for consideration at the special meeting to authorize the named proxies to approve one
or more adjournments of the special meeting if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the
special meeting. Even though a quorum may be present at the special meeting, it is possible that Merchants may not have received
sufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement by the time of the special meeting. In that event, Merchants would need to adjourn
the special meeting in order to solicit additional proxies.

To allow the proxies that have been received by Merchants at the time of the special meeting to be voted for an adjournment, if
necessary, Merchants is submitting a proposal to approve one or more adjournments, and only under those circumstances, to you
for consideration. If the new date, time and place is announced at the special meeting before the adjournment, Merchants is not
required to give notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting, unless the board of directors fixes a new record date for the
special meeting.

The adjournment proposal relates only to an adjournment of the special meeting occurring for purposes of soliciting additional
proxies for adoption of the Merger Agreement proposal in the event that there are insufficient votes to approve that proposal. The
Merchants board of directors retains full authority to the extent set forth in the Merchants bylaws and Delaware law to adjourn the
special meeting for any other purpose, or to postpone the special meeting before it is convened, without the consent of any
Merchants stockholders.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MERCHANTS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS
VOTE “FOR” THE PROPOSAL TO ADJOURN THE SPECIAL MEETING, IF NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE,
INCLUDING TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL PROXIES TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

OTHER MATTERS

As of the date of this document, management of Merchants knows of no other matters which may be brought before the special
stockholders’ meeting other than as described in this document. However, if any matter other than the Merger or related matters
should properly come before the special meeting, the proxies will be deemed to confer authority to the individuals named as
authorized therein to vote the shares represented by the proxy as to any matters that fall within the purposes set forth in the notices
of special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK OF COMMUNITY BANK SYSTEM

Merchants stockholders who receive shares of Community Bank System common stock in the Merger will become stockholders
of Community Bank System. Community Bank System is a Delaware corporation subject to the provisions of Delaware law. Given
below is a summary of the material features of the Community Bank System common stock. This summary is not a complete
discussion of the charter documents and other instruments of Community Bank System that create the rights of the stockholders.
You are urged to read carefully those documents and instruments, which have been incorporated by reference as exhibits to the
registration statement of which this document is a part. Please see “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 104 of this
Proxy Statement/Prospectus for information on how to obtain copies of those documents and instruments.

General

Community Bank System is authorized to issue 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share. As of February
2, 2017, 44,541,412 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. Community Bank System’s certificate of incorporation
also authorizes the board of directors, without stockholder approval (subject to the rules of the NYSE, if applicable), to issue up to
500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, and to establish the relative rights, designations, preferences and
limitations or restrictions of the preferred stock. As of the date of this document, there were no shares of preferred stock issued and
outstanding.

Common Stock

Voting Rights.  The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders.
No stockholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.

Dividends.  Community Bank System may pay dividends as declared from time to time by the board of directors out of funds
legally available for dividends, subject to certain restrictions. The holders of Community Bank System common stock will be
entitled to receive any dividends on the common stock in proportion to their holdings.

Rights in Liquidation.  In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Community Bank System, each holder of
Community Bank System common stock would be entitled to receive, after payment of all debts and liabilities of Community Bank
System and after any required distribution to holders of any issued and outstanding preferred stock, a pro rata portion of all
remaining assets of Community Bank System.

No Preemptive Rights; No Redemption.  Holders of shares of Community Bank System common stock are not entitled to
preemptive rights with respect to any shares of any capital stock of Community Bank System that may be issued. Community Bank
System common stock is not subject to call or redemption.

Certain Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws Provisions

There are provisions in Community Bank System’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws which are intended to discourage
non-negotiated takeover attempts. These provisions are intended to avoid costly takeover battles and lessen Community Bank
System’s exposure to coercive takeover attempts at an unfair price, and are designed to maximize stockholder value in connection
with unsolicited takeover attempts. These provisions, however, could reduce the premium that potential acquirers might be willing
to pay in an acquisition, which may in turn reduce the market price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of
Community Bank System common stock.

Community Bank System’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue, without further stockholder
approval, up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those of its common stock, except as may be required with
respect to a particular transaction by applicable law or by regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over Community Bank System.
The board of directors of Community Bank System is permitted to establish from time to time the relative rights, designations,
preferences and limitations or restrictions of the preferred stock. The preferred stock could be used to deter future attempts to gain
control of Community Bank System.

Community Bank System has a classified board which provides for the board to be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in
number as possible, with approximately one-third of the directors to be elected

TABLE OF CONTENTS

annually for three-year terms. A classified board helps to assure continuity and stability of corporate leadership and policy by
extending the time required to elect a majority of the directors to at least two successive annual meetings. This extension of time
may also discourage a tender offer or takeover bid by making it more difficult for a majority of stockholders to change the
composition of the board of directors.

In addition, Community Bank System’s certificate of incorporation contains a provision which requires that certain business
combinations be approved by the affirmative vote of either (a) the holders of three-fourths of the outstanding shares of Community
Bank System common stock and a majority of the board of directors; or (b) the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of
Community Bank System common stock and two-thirds of the continuing Directors. These “supermajority” requirements could
result in Community Bank System’s board exercising a stronger influence over any proposed takeover (subject to its fiduciary
duties) by refusing to approve a proposed business combination and by obtaining sufficient additional votes, including votes
obtained through the issuance of additional shares to parties friendly to their interests, to preclude the two-thirds or three-fourths
stockholder approval requirement.

Community Bank System’s certificate of incorporation also provides that the above described provisions designed to protect
Community Bank System from unfriendly takeover attempts can only be amended by the affirmative vote of (a) holders of at least
three-fourths of the outstanding shares of Community Bank System common stock and a majority of the board of directors, or (b)
holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Community Bank System common stock and two-thirds of the continuing
directors.

Under the certificate of incorporation of Community Bank System, the stockholders of the company are prohibited from
approving corporate actions by a written consent in lieu of a meeting. Instead, any corporate action to be approved by Community
Bank System stockholders must be so approved at a stockholders’ meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF MERCHANTS COMMON STOCK AND COMMUNITY BANK
SYSTEM COMMON STOCK

Merchants is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. The rights of Merchants stockholders derive from
Merchants’ certificate of incorporation and bylaws and from the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”).

Community Bank System is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. The rights of Community Bank System
stockholders derive from Community Bank System’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and from the DGCL.

Thus, following the Merger, the rights of Merchants stockholders who become Community Bank System stockholders in the
Merger will no longer be governed by the Merchants’ certificate of incorporation and Merchants’ bylaws, but instead will be
governed by Community Bank System’s certificate of incorporation and Community Bank System’s bylaws.

Set forth below is a summary of material differences between the rights of Merchants stockholders under the Merchants articles
of incorporation and the Merchants bylaws, and the rights of Community Bank System stockholders under the Community Bank
System certificate of incorporation and Community Bank System bylaws. The summary set forth below is not intended to provide a
comprehensive discussion of each company’s governing documents. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of the Merchants certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the Community Bank System certificate of incorporation and
Community Bank System bylaws.

Authorized Capital Stock

Community Bank System.  Under its certificate of incorporation, Community Bank System is authorized to issue 75,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share. At February 2,
2017, there were 44,541,412 shares of Community Bank System common stock issued and outstanding. Although no shares of
preferred stock are currently outstanding, the board of directors may, without stockholder approval (subject to the rules of the
NYSE, if applicable), issue shares of preferred stock with the relative rights, designations, preferences and limitations or
restrictions established by the board. The ability of Community Bank System to issue shares of preferred stock could have an anti-
takeover effect.

Merchants.  Merchants’ authorized capital stock consists of (i) 10,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.01
per share; (ii) 200,000 shares of Class A non-voting preferred stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share; and (iii) 1,500,000 shares
of Class B voting preferred stock, with a par value of $0.01 per share. The Merchants certificate of incorporation authorizes
Merchants’ board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the designations, powers,
preferences, and rights of the shares of preferred stock in each series. At February 2, 2017, there were 6,898,903 shares of common
stock issued and outstanding. No shares of Merchants preferred stock were issued and outstanding as of that date.

Quorum of Stockholders

Community Bank System.  In order to have a quorum for the transaction of business at any stockholders’ meeting, the holders of
at least one-third of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy, unless a greater
number is required by the DGCL.

Merchants.  In order to have a quorum for the transaction of business at any stockholders’ meeting, the holders of at least a
majority of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy.

Nomination of Directors and Stockholder Proposals

Community Bank System.  Community Bank System’s bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the board of
directors may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the board of directors, or by any stockholder entitled to
vote at the election who gives advanced written notice to the Secretary not less than 60 days or more than 90 days prior to the
meeting (provided that if Community Bank System gives less than 60 days’ notice of the meeting date, the nominating
stockholder’s notice must be given

within ten days following the mailing date of the Community Bank System notice). Each such notice must contain specified
information concerning the nominee, the nominating stockholder and certain related interests of the nominating stockholder.

Community Bank System’s bylaws provide that for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder,
the stockholder must give timely written notice to the Secretary at least 45 days prior to the date of the annual meeting, provided,
however, that if less than 60 days’ notice of the annual meeting is given, then the stockholder’s written notice of the business to be
brought before the annual meeting must be so received not later than the close of business on the 15th day following the date on
which such notice of the date of annual meeting was mailed. Each such notice must contain specified information concerning the
proposed business, the proposing stockholder and certain related interests of the proposing stockholder.

Merchants.  Merchants’ bylaws provide that stockholders of Merchants may nominate one or more persons for election as
director only if such nominations are delivered to the secretary of Merchants at the principal executive offices of the corporation
not later than the close of business on the 90th day and not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more
than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, notice
by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the
scheduled date of such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such
meeting is first made. Each such notice must contain specified information concerning the nominee, the nominating stockholder
and certain related interests of the nominating stockholder.

Merchants’ bylaws provide that a proposal by a stockholder for submission of a matter to a vote of stockholders at an annual
meeting must be delivered to the secretary of Merchants within the same time frame as stockholder nominations for directors
described above. Each such notice must contain specified information concerning the proposal, the proposing stockholder and
certain related interests of the proposing stockholder.

In addition, the stockholder must provide specified updates or supplements to the foregoing information.

Election of Directors

Community Bank System.  Community Bank System’s bylaws provide that directors shall, except as otherwise required by law
or by the certificate of incorporation, be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders by the holders of shares
entitled to vote in the election. No stockholder has the right of cumulative voting in the election of directors.

Merchants.  Merchants’ bylaws provide that any election of directors by stockholders shall be determined by a plurality of the
votes properly cast on the election of directors. No stockholder has the right of cumulative voting in the election of directors.

Qualification of Directors

Community Bank System.  Delaware law provides that a director need not be a stockholder unless so required by the certificate
of incorporation or the bylaws. The Community Bank System certificate of incorporation and the Community Bank System bylaws
do not contain further qualifications for directors. Currently, each director of Community Bank System also serves as a director of
Community Bank, which is a national banking association. The National Bank Act and the related regulations require that a
director of a national banking association must be a citizen of the United States and must own shares of capital stock of the
association or its parent company, the aggregate par value, stockholders’ equity or fair market value of which shares is not less than
$1,000. Generally, at least a majority of the directors of a national banking association must have resided in the state in which the
association is located, or within 100 miles of the location of the office of the association, for at least one year immediately before
the election as a director and must continue to reside within those areas during the term of office. Community Bank System has a
mandatory retirement policy and under its bylaws, directors must retire at December 31 of the year in which the director reaches
age 70.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Merchants.  Delaware law provides that a director need not be a stockholder unless so required by the certificate of
incorporation or the bylaws. The Merchants certificate of incorporation and the Merchants bylaws do not contain further
qualifications for directors. There are no residency requirements to serve as a director of Merchants, nor do the Merchants
certificate of incorporation or bylaws specify any disqualifications from serving as a director. Currently, Merchants’ board of
directors consists of 11 directors. Each Merchants director also serves as a director of Merchants Bank, a Vermont chartered
commercial bank. Vermont law does not impose any stock ownership requirements on Merchants Bank directors. Merchants does
not have a mandatory retirement policy for its directors.

Number of Directors

Community Bank System.  The total number of directors on the board of directors may be changed from time to time by the
board or the stockholders. Neither the certificate of incorporation nor the bylaws imposes any limitation on the total number of
directors of Community Bank System. The Community Bank System board of directors is currently composed of 12 directors and
divided into three classes. After consummation of the Merger, the board will be composed of 14 directors.

Merchants.  The Merchants bylaws provide that the number of directors constituting the board of directors will be fixed solely
and exclusively by resolution of the board of directors or by the stockholders at the annual meeting, subject to the limitation
contained in the Merchants certificate of incorporation that the number of directors shall not be less than nine. The Merchants board
of directors is currently composed of 11 directors and is divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible, with
approximately one-third of the directors elected by the stockholders each year at the annual meeting of stockholders. Directors hold
office until the third annual meeting following their election or until a successor has been duly elected and qualified or until a
director’s earlier death, resignation or removal.

Removal of Directors

Community Bank System.  Under Delaware law, directors of a corporation with a classified board (like Community Bank
System) may be removed by the holders of a majority of shares then entitled to vote at the election of directors, but only for cause,
unless the certificate of incorporation of the corporation provides that they can also be removed without cause. The bylaws of
Community Bank System permit the stockholders representing a majority of the shares then entitled to vote to remove directors
with or without cause. The board of directors is not authorized to remove a director.

Merchants.  Under Delaware law, directors of a corporation with a classified board (like Merchants) may be removed by the
holders of a majority of shares then entitled to vote at the election of directors, but only for cause, unless the certificate of
incorporation of the corporation provides that they can also be removed without cause. Under the Merchants bylaws, any director,
or the entire board of directors, may be removed from office for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares then entitled to vote in the election of directors. The board of directors is not authorized to remove a director.

Vacancies on the Board of Directors

Community Bank System.  Community Bank System’s bylaws provide that all vacancies on the board of directors may be filled
by vote of a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, or may be filled
by a plurality of the votes cast by stockholders of Community Bank System entitled to vote in the election at a special meeting of
stockholders called for that purpose.

Merchants.  Merchants’ certificate of incorporation provides that in case of any vacancy on the board of directors or any
increase in the number of directors constituting the whole board, such vacancy shall be filled by the directors or by the stockholders
at the time having voting power.

Voting and Proxies

Community Bank System.  Holders of Community Bank System are entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock standing
in their name on the record of stockholders.

At any meeting of stockholders (at which a quorum was present to organize the meeting), all matters, except as otherwise
provided by law or by certificate of incorporation or by the bylaws, shall be decided by a

majority of the votes cast at such meeting by the holders of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote
thereon, whether or not a quorum is present when the vote is taken. Every stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders
may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy. The validity and enforceability of any proxy shall be determined
in accordance with Section 212 of the DGCL.

Merchants.  Holders of Merchants are entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock standing in their name on the record of
stockholders.

At any meeting of stockholders (at which a quorum was present to organize the meeting), any matter before any such meeting
(other than an election of a director or directors), except as otherwise provided by law or by certificate of incorporation or by the
bylaws, shall be decided by a majority of the votes cast at such meeting by the holders of shares present in person, represented by
written proxy, or by a transmission permitted by Section 212(c) of the DGCL, whether or not a quorum is present when the vote is
taken. Every stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him by
proxy. The validity and enforceability of any proxy shall be determined in accordance with Section 212 of the DGCL.

Payment of Dividends

Community Bank System.  Delaware law provides that dividends may be paid either out of a corporation’s surplus or, in the
event that no surplus exists, from its net profits, if any, from either the year the dividends were declared or the prior year. Capital
surplus is the excess of the net assets of the corporation over the stated capital of the corporation. There are certain other regulatory
and contractual restrictions on Community Bank System’s ability to pay cash dividends.

Merchants.  Delaware law provides that dividends may be paid either out of a corporation’s surplus or, in the event that no
surplus exists, from its net profits, if any, from either the year the dividends were declared or the prior year. Capital surplus is the
excess of the net assets of the corporation over the stated capital of the corporation. There are certain other regulatory and
contractual restrictions on Merchants’ ability to pay cash dividends.

Special Meeting of Stockholders

Community Bank System.  Under the DGCL, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by a corporation’s board of
directors or by the persons authorized to do so in the corporation’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Community Bank
System’s bylaws provide that a special meeting may be called by the Chairman of the Board or the President or the Secretary or by
any three or more Directors.

At any special meeting of stockholders, only such business may be transacted as is related to the purpose or purposes of such
meeting set forth in the notice thereof given pursuant to the bylaws or in any waiver of notice thereof given pursuant to the bylaws.

Merchants.  Under the DGCL, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by a corporation’s board of directors or by the
persons authorized to do so in the corporation’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Merchants’ bylaws provide that a special
meeting of stockholders may be called by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution approved by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the directors then in office, except as otherwise required by statute and subject to the rights of the holders of any series
of undesignated preferred stock.

Only those matters set forth in the notice of the special meeting may be considered or acted upon at a special meeting of
stockholders of Merchants.

Rights of Stockholders to Dissent

Community Bank System.  Under Delaware law, appraisal rights are generally available for the shares of any class or series of
stock of a corporation involved in a merger or consolidation. However, no appraisal rights are available for any stock, which on the
record date of the stockholder meeting to approve the transaction, is listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ, or held
of record by more than 2,000 stockholders. Also, no appraisal rights are available to stockholders of the surviving corporation in a
merger if

their approval is not required. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appraisal rights are available for the class or series if the holders
thereof receive in the merger or consolidation anything except:

• shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation;

• shares of stock of any other corporation that, at the effective date of the merger or consolidation, are either listed on a
national securities exchange or NASDAQ, or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders;

• cash in lieu of fractional shares; or

• any combination of the foregoing.

Merchants.  Holders of Merchants common stock are subject to the same appraisal rights under Delaware law described directly
above.

Indemnification and Limitation of Liability

Community Bank System.  The Community Bank System certificate of incorporation provides that a director shall not be
personally liable to Community Bank System or its stockholders for monetary damages for a breach of fiduciary duty, except for
liability:

• for a breach of the duty of loyalty;

• for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

• under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or

• for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

Community Bank System will indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law any person against liabilities and
expenses incurred by reason of the fact that he or she was acting as a director or officer of Community Bank System. Community
Bank System may also provide indemnification to its employees and agents.

Merchants.  The Merchants certificate of incorporation provides that no director of Merchants shall be personally liable to
Merchants or to any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any
provision of law imposing such liability; provided, however, that the liability of a director shall not be limited or eliminated for any
of the following:

• any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to Merchants or its stockholders;

• acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

• unlawful distributions under the DGCL; or

• for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

The Merchants certificate of incorporation provides that Merchants must indemnify each director and officer of the corporation,
his or her heirs, executors and administrators, and may indemnify each employee and agent of Merchants, his or her heirs,
executors, administrators and all other persons whom Merchants is authorized to indemnify under the DGCL, to the extent
permitted by law (i) against all expenses (including attorney’s fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by the indemnified person in connection with any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, or in connection with any appeal therein, or otherwise, and (ii) against all expenses (including
attorney’s fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnified person in connection with the defense or settlement of any
derivative action or suit or in connection with any appeal or otherwise; and no provision of the Merchants certificate of
incorporation is to be construed as limiting any of the rights conferred by the DGCL with respect to indemnification of officers and
directors.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Certain Voting Rights and Restrictions with Respect to Mergers

Community Bank System.  Under Delaware law, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a
corporation requires approval by a majority of the outstanding shares, unless the corporation’s certificate of incorporation requires a
higher percentage. Where approval of stockholders is required by Delaware law, the Community Bank System certificate of
incorporation requires a higher percentage with respect to “business combinations” with “interested stockholders” as discussed
below.

An interested stockholder is the beneficial owner of common stock representing three percent or more of the votes entitled to be
cast, an affiliate or associate of Community Bank System who was an interested stockholder at any time during the preceding two
years, or an assignee or successor in interest of shares which were owned at any time during the preceding two years by an
interested stockholder.

A business combination between Community Bank System and an interested stockholder requires the approval of a majority of
the board of directors and at least three-fourths of the votes entitled to be cast, or at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast
and two-thirds of the continuing directors. A “business combination” includes:

• any merger or consolidation with Community Bank System or any of its subsidiaries with (i) any interested stockholder or
(ii) any other corporation (whether or not itself an interested stockholder) which is or after such merger or consolidation
will be an affiliate or associate of an interested stockholder;

• any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions) to or
with any interested stockholder or any affiliate or associate of any interested stockholder involving any assets or securities
of Community Bank System or any of its subsidiaries having an aggregate fair market value of $3,000,000 or more;

• the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of Community Bank System proposed by or on behalf
of an interested stockholder or any affiliate or associate of any interested stockholder;

• any reclassification of securities (including any reverse stock split), or recapitalization, any merger or consolidation of
Community Bank System with one of its subsidiaries, or any other transaction (whether or not with or otherwise involving
an interested stockholder) which has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportion of the outstanding shares
of any class of equity or convertible securities which is beneficially owned by an interested stockholder or any affiliate or
associate of any interested stockholder; and

• any agreement, contract, or other arrangement providing for any one or more of the actions specified in the foregoing.

In addition, Section 203 of the DGCL applies to Delaware corporations with a class of voting stock listed on a national
securities exchange, authorized for quotation on NASDAQ, or held of record by 2,000 or more persons, and restricts transactions
which may be entered into by a corporation and certain of its stockholders. Community Bank System has not elected to “opt out” of
Section 203, as permitted by that section.

Section 203 provides, in essence, that an “interested stockholder,” defined as a stockholder acquiring more than 15%, but less
than 85%, of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation subject to the statute and its affiliates and associates, may not engage in
certain “business combinations” with the corporation for a period of three years subsequent to the date on which the stockholder
became an interested stockholder unless:

• prior to that date, the corporation’s board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction in which
the stockholder became an interested person, or

• the business combination is approved by the corporation’s board of directors and authorized at a stockholders’ meeting by a
vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation not owned by the interested person.

Section 203 defines the term “business combination” to include a wide variety of transactions with or caused by an interested
person in which the interested person receives or could receive a benefit on other than

TABLE OF CONTENTS

a pro rata basis with other stockholders, including mergers, certain asset sales, certain issuances of additional shares to the
interested person, transactions with the corporation which increase the proportionate interest of the interested person or transactions
in which the interested person receives certain other benefits.

Merchants.  The Merchants certificate of incorporation generally requires that specified business combination transactions be
approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of Merchants voting stock, unless the transaction is approved by the
unanimous vote of all of Merchants’ directors then in office. This vote requirement applies to any of the following: (i) any plan of
merger or consolidation to which Merchants is a party and which requires stockholder approval, or (ii) any sale, lease, exchange,
mortgage, pledge or other disposition of all, or substantially all of Merchants’ assets not made in the usual and regular course of
business, or (iii) a combination or majority share acquisition in which Merchants is the acquiring corporation and a majority of its
voting shares is issued or transferred to another corporation or entity, or person, or to stockholders of another corporation or entity.
If the business combination is unanimously approved by the directors, the required stockholder vote to approve the transaction is
reduced to two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the outstanding shares of voting capital stock.

Merchants has not elected to “opt out” of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as permitted by that section
(see description of Section 203 above).

Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation

Community Bank System.  Under Delaware law, the Community Bank System certificate of incorporation may be amended only
if the amendment is first proposed by the Community Bank System board of directors and is approved by a majority of outstanding
shares entitled to vote thereon. Where the rights of a certain class of shares is affected by the amendment, a majority of that class of
shares must also approve the amendment, regardless if such class is otherwise entitled to vote on the amendment. Under
Community Bank System’s certificate of incorporation, amendments to provisions relating to the election and classification of
directors, the limitation of director’s liability, a business combination with an interested stockholder or an amendment to the
certificate require the approval of a majority of the board of directors and at least three-fourths of the votes entitled to be cast by the
holders of Community Bank System common stock, or at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast and two-thirds of the
continuing directors.

Merchants.  Under Delaware law, the Merchants certificate of incorporation may be amended only if the amendment is first
proposed by the Merchants board of directors and is approved by a majority of outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. Where
the rights of a certain class of shares is affected by the amendment, a majority of that class of shares must also approve the
amendment, regardless if such class is otherwise entitled to vote on the amendment. The Merchants certificate of incorporation
provides that any amendment to the certificate of incorporation requires the vote of two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the outstanding shares
entitled to vote. In addition, the Merchants certificate of incorporation provides that amendments to certain sections of the
Merchants certificate of incorporation that have an antitakeover effect require the affirmative vote of 80% or more of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote.

Amendment to Bylaws

Community Bank System.  The board of directors of Community Bank System may adopt, amend or repeal Community Bank
System’s bylaws by a majority vote, provided that the bylaws may also be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders of
Community Bank System by the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote on the subject matter.

Merchants.  The Merchants bylaws authorize the board of directors to amend or repeal the bylaws by vote of a majority of the
board of directors at a meeting. The Merchants bylaws also may be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least 75% percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such amendment or repeal, voting together as a single class;
provided, however, that if the board of directors recommends that stockholders approve the amendment or repeal, its adoption will
only require the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such amendment or repeal, voting
together as a single class.

by Community, and Merchants agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as Community may reasonably request in
order to give effect to such restructuring; provided, however, that no such change or amendment shall (a) alter or change the

with respect to Merchants’ stockholders or prevent the rendering of the opinions contemplated in Sections 5.2(d) and 5.3(d), (c) be
reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be prevented or materially delayed or the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to
be prevented or materially delayed or (d) require submission to or approval of the Merchants stockholders after the plan of merger
set forth herein has been adopted by the Merchants stockholders.

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 Treatment of Common Stock. (a) Treatment of Merchants Common Stock.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of any securities of Merchants or of Community, subject to
Section 2.1(c) and any applicable withholding Tax, each share of Merchants Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Merchants Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b), Merchants Restricted
Shares and other than any Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive, at the election of
the holder thereof in accordance with, and subject to, the terms, conditions and procedures set forth in this Article 2 (including the
proration procedures in Section 2.2(c)) and subject to potential adjustment as provided in Section 6.1(h), the following
consideration (collectively, the “Merger Consideration”), in each case without interest: (i) the combination (such election, a “Mixed
Election”) of (A) $12.00 in cash (the “Mixed Cash Consideration”) and (B) 0.6741 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
Community Shares (the “Mixed Stock Consideration” and, together with the Mixed Cash Consideration, the “Mixed Election
Consideration”); (ii) (such election, a “Cash Election”) $40.00 in cash (the “Cash Election Consideration”); or (iii) (such election, a
“Stock Election”) 0.9630 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Community Shares (such number of Community Shares, the
“Stock Election Consideration”), without interest. From and after the Effective Time, all such Merchants Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Merchants Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of
such Merchants Shares in accordance with Section 2.2(c) or Section 2.3(b) or in accordance with Section 2.5, as applicable,
including the right to receive, pursuant to Section 2.7, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Community Common Stock, if any, into
which such Merchants Shares have been converted pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) (the “Fractional Share Consideration”), together
with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f).

(b) Cancellation of Merchants Common Stock.  At the Effective Time, all Merchants Shares owned by any of the Parties or by
any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than any such shares owned in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously
contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Adjustment to Merger Consideration.  The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Merchants
Common Stock or Community Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of shares of Merchants Common Stock or Community Common
Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Community Common Stock.  At and after the Effective Time, each share of Community Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of Community Common Stock
and shall not be affected by the Merger.

Section 2.2 Election and Proration Procedures.  (a) An election form in such form as Community shall reasonably specify and
as shall be reasonably acceptable to Merchants (the “Election Form”) shall be mailed on a date to be mutually agreed by the Parties
that is not more than forty-five (45) days nor less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date or on such other date as
the Parties shall mutually agree (the “Mailing Date”) to each holder of record of Merchants Common Stock as of the close of
business on the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Mailing Date (the “Election Form Record Date”).

(b) Community shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all
Persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Merchants Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the
close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election Deadline, and Merchants shall provide to the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

(c) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and
instructions) to specify (x) the number of shares of such holder’s Merchants Common Stock with respect to which such holder
makes a Mixed Election (each such share, a “Mixed Election Share”), (y) the number of shares of such holder’s Merchants
Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election (each such share, a “Cash Election Share”), and (z) the
number of shares of such holder’s Merchants Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Stock Election (each such
share, a “Stock Election Share”). Any Merchants Shares with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective,
properly completed Election Form (including duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form), accompanied
by any Merchants Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which such Election Form relates, or by an appropriate customary guaranty
of delivery of the related Merchants Certificates from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial
bank or trust company in the United States, on or before 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the twenty-fifth (25th) day following the
Mailing Date (or such other time and date as the Parties shall agree) (the “Election Deadline”) (other than Merchants Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b), Merchants Restricted Shares and Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed to be
“No Election Shares,” and the holders of such No Election Shares shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election with respect to
such No Election Shares. The Parties shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the
date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) Business Days before, and at least five (5) Business Days prior to, the
Election Deadline. Not later than ten (10) Business Days after the Election Deadline, unless the Effective Time has not yet
occurred, in which case as soon after the Effective Time as is reasonably practicable, Community shall cause the Exchange Agent
to effect the following prorations to the Merger Consideration:

(i) If the Cash Election Amount is greater than the Available Cash Election Amount, then each Cash Election Share shall,
instead of being converted into the Cash Election Consideration, be converted into the right to receive (A) an amount of cash
(without interest) equal to the product of the Cash Election Consideration, multiplied by a fraction, (1) the numerator of which
shall be the Available Cash Election Amount and (2) the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such
fraction, the “Cash Fraction”), and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Community Shares equal to the
product of the Stock Election Consideration multiplied by a fraction equal to one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

(ii) If the Available Cash Election Amount is greater than the Cash Election Amount, then each Stock Election Share shall,
instead of being converted into the right to receive the Stock Election Consideration, be converted into the right to receive (A)
an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the amount of such excess divided by the number of Stock Election Shares, and
(B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Community Shares equal to the product of the Stock Election
Consideration multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the difference between (I) the Cash Election
Consideration minus (II) the amount calculated in clause (A) of this paragraph, and the denominator of which shall be the Cash
Election Consideration.

(d) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed
Election Form (including duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form), accompanied by any Merchants
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which such Election Form relates, or by an appropriate customary guaranty of delivery of the
related Merchants Certificates from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust
company in the United States, by the Election Deadline. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the authorized Person
properly submitting such Election Form, by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the
event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Merchants Common Stock represented by such
Election Form shall become No Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or
all of such shares of Merchants Common Stock prior to the Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has
been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith

decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Community, Merchants, or the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

Section 2.3 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Merchants Certificates.

(a) Exchange Fund.  Prior to the Effective Time, Community shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
Merchants to act as the exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the “Exchange Agent”). The Exchange Agent shall also act
as the agent for Merchants’ stockholders (other than with respect to Merchants Restricted Shares) for the purpose of receiving and
holding their Election Forms and Merchants Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares
represented thereby. At or prior to the Closing, Community shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i)
evidence of Community Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in book-entry form equal to the aggregate Community
Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately
available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share
Consideration and any dividends under Section 2.3(f) (such evidence of book-entry shares of Community Common Stock and cash
amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, the “Exchange Fund”), in each case, for the sole
benefit of the holders of shares of Merchants Common Stock. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the
aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under Section 2.3(f),
Community shall promptly deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the
amount required to make such payment. Community shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make,
delivery of the Merger Consideration, including payment of the Fractional Share Consideration, and any amounts payable in
respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Community Common Stock (other than with respect to Merchants
Restricted Shares) in accordance with Section 2.3(f) out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund
shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Community; provided, however, that (x) no such investment or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Merchants Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article 2
and (y) no such investment shall have maturities that would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay payments to be made
pursuant to this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Community on the
earlier of (A) one (1) year after the Effective Time or (B) the full payment of the Exchange Fund.

(b) Procedures for Surrender.  Promptly (but no more than five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Community shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Merchants Shares (the “Merchants Certificates”)
or non-certificated Merchants Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) and whose Merchants Shares were
converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and who has not theretofore submitted its
Merchants Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with an Election Form (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Merchants Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Merchants Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Community
may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Merchants Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration into which such Merchants Shares have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.1, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.7, and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Community Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3(f).
Upon surrender of a Merchants Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Community, together with such letter of transmittal or
Election Form duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Merchants Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2,

any Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.7, and any
amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Community Common
Stock in accordance with Section 2.3(f) for each Merchants Share formerly represented by such Merchants Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, to be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder) within five (5)
Business Days following the later to occur of (x) the completion of the prorations to the Merger Consideration as described in
Section 2.2(c) and (y) the Exchange Agent’s receipt of such Merchants Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share, and the Merchants Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent
shall accept such Merchants Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Merchants Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (A) the Merchants Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Merchants Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Community that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Merchants Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article
2, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with Section 2.7, and any dividends or
other distributions on shares of Community Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3(f), without interest thereon.

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Merchants Shares.  At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
Merchants shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Merchants Shares on the records of
Merchants. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Merchants Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Merchants Restricted Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Merchants Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, Merchants Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Merchants Restricted Shares) are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability.  At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time,
Community shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Exchange Agent’s routine administrative procedures, to holders of Merchants Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to Community (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.7, and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Community Common Stock in
accordance with Section 2.3(f), payable upon due surrender of their Merchants Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance
with the procedures in Section 2.3(b), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Community nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Merchants Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other
amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Merchants Certificates.  In the event that any Merchants Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Merchants Certificates, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section
2.1 hereof, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with Section 2.7, and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Community Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3(f).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(f) Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Community Common Stock.  No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Community Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Merchants
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Community Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all such
dividends and other distributions shall be paid by Community to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund,
in each case until the surrender of such Merchants Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Merchants Certificate or Book-Entry
Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Community Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Community Common Stock.

Section 2.4 Dissenters’ Rights.  (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Merchants Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of record who did not vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement (or consent thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Merchants Shares
(“Dissenting Shares”) pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Appraisal Rights”) shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1, but instead at the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Merchants Shares in accordance with the
Appraisal Rights (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto other than the right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by the Appraisal Rights);
provided, however, that if any such holder (including any holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under the Appraisal Rights, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive,
without interest or duplication, the Mixed Election Consideration. “Proposed Dissenting Shares” means shares of Merchants
Common Stock whose holders provide demands for appraisal to Merchants prior to the Merchants Stockholder Meeting and do not
vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with the Appraisal Rights.

(b) Merchants shall give prompt notice to Community of any demands received by Merchants for appraisal of any Merchants
Shares, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by Merchants
relating to Appraisal Rights, and Community shall have the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, Merchants shall not, without the prior written consent of Community,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

Section 2.5 Treatment of Merchants Equity Awards.  (a) As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase Merchants Common
Stock granted under any Merchants Benefit Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
“Merchants Stock Option”), whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall, automatically and without any action on behalf of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into a right of the former holder of such Merchants Stock Option to receive the
applicable Merchants Stock Option Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, the “Merchants Stock Option Consideration”

accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and (D) have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such
statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of Community and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and
reflect only actual transactions. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not resigned (or informed Community that it intends to
resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Community as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with Community on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure.

(iv) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Community, neither Community nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liability (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due) required by GAAP to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of Community,
except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Community included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016 (including any notes thereto), and for liabilities
incurred (A) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2016, or (B) in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(v) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Community and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained
and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are
under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Community or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Community. Community (A) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information relating to Community, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of Community by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Community’s outside auditors
and the audit committee of Community’s Board of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the

reasonably likely to adversely affect Community’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(y) to the Knowledge of Community, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in Community’s internal controls over financial reporting. To the Knowledge of Community, there is no
reason to believe that Community’s outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to
give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(vi) Since December 31, 2013, (A) neither Community nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Community,

accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Community or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Community or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (B) no attorney representing Community or any of its Subsidiaries, whether

Section 4.3 Litigation.  Each of Community and Merchants shall promptly notify each other in writing of any Litigation issued,

matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that, because of (x) the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a
Superior Proposal or (y) the occurrence of an Intervening Event, failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Merchants may (A) make an Adverse Recommendation Change (although

Directors of Merchants may communicate the basis for its Adverse Recommendation Change to Merchants’ stockholders in the

agreed that no such termination shall be effective unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination Merchants pays or
causes to be paid to Community the Termination Fee and otherwise complies with Section 6.1(i) and Section 6.2(c)); provided
further, that the Board of Directors of Merchants (including any committee thereof) may not take any actions under the foregoing
proviso unless (i) it gives Community at least four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a
reasonably detailed description of the Acquisition Proposal or Intervening Event giving rise to its determination to take such action
(including, in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in any
such Acquisition Proposal (including an unredacted copy of all proposed agreements and other documents with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal) or any amendment or modification thereof) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors
of Merchants takes into account in good faith any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Community and after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that

Business Day notice period referred to in clause (i) above, Merchants shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to,
negotiate with Community in good faith (to the extent Community seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Community. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal or
material development with respect to any Intervening Event will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal or Intervening Event,
as the case may be, for purposes of this Section 4.5(a) and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 4.5(a),
except that any reference to four (4) Business Days shall instead be three (3) Business Days.

(b) Subject to applicable Law, Merchants shall adjourn or postpone the Merchants Stockholder Meeting if, as of the time for

has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Merchants Stockholder Approval, and,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Merchants shall continue to use all reasonable best efforts, together with its
proxy solicitor, to solicit proxies from Merchants stockholders in favor of the Merchants Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Merchants Stockholder
Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of Merchants at the Merchants Stockholder
Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Merchants of such obligation.

issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

Section 4.7 Reasonable Best Efforts.  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Section 4.8, the
Parties will use all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to permit consummation of the Merger as promptly as practicable and
otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and each will cooperate fully with and furnish
information to the other Party to that end, and obtain all consents of, and give all notices to and make all filings with, all
Governmental Authorities and other third parties that may be or become necessary for the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that Merchants shall not agree to make any
payments or modifications to agreements in connection therewith without the prior written consent of Community, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; and provided further, that nothing contained herein shall preclude any
Party from exercising its rights under this Agreement.

necessary to consummate the Bank Merger.

to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing.

Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection

respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Community and Merchants shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication, whether in writing or oral, from any Governmental Authority whose Consent is required for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any
Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such Consent will be materially delayed.

(g) As used in this Agreement, the “Requisite Regulatory Approvals” shall mean all regulatory authorizations, Consents, Orders
or approvals from, to or with (x) the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC, the FDIC, the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation
and/or the Massachusetts Division of Banks that are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger and the Bank Merger, and (y) any other Governmental Authority that are necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, except in the case of this clause (y) for
any such authorizations, Consents, Orders or approvals the failure of which to be obtained or made would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Merchants or Community, as the case may be.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall require Community or its
Subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any actions, or to accept any restriction, requirement or condition, that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Community, Merchants and their respective
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by Merchants or any of its Subsidiaries, or
Community or any of its Subsidiaries, of all or any material portion of the business or assets of Merchants and its Subsidiaries or
Community and its Subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole, or compel Community or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or
hold separate all or any material portion of the business or assets of Merchants and its Subsidiaries or Community and its
Subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole (a “Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition”).

such other Party informed on a current basis) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact, event, change,
circumstance or effect that (a) is reasonably likely to result in any Material Adverse Effect on it, or (b) would cause or constitute a
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements contained herein; provided, that any failure to give notice
in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute the failure of any condition set forth
in Section 5.2(a) or 5.2(b), or Section 5.3(a) or 5.3(b), as the case may be, to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by such Party due to its failure to give such notice unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure
of the conditions set forth in Section 5.2(a) or 5.2(b), or Section 5.3(a) or 5.3(b), as the case may be, or give rise to a termination
right under Section 6.1.

Section 4.10 Investigation and Confidentiality.  (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, Merchants shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other Representatives of
Community, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of their properties, books,
Contracts, commitments, personnel, information technology systems and records, and, during such period, Merchants shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Community such information concerning their respective businesses, properties
and personnel as Community may reasonably request. Community shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
interference with Merchants’ regular business operations during any such access. Neither Merchants nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of Merchants (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar
agreement between the Parties) or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. No investigation by Community shall affect the representations and warranties of Merchants or the right of
Community to rely thereon.

of Community or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (“Continuing Employees”) shall be given, subject to applicable Law,

Employees participate following the Effective Time and for purposes of determining length of vacation, sick time, paid time off and

addition, under the welfare plans of Community and its Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees participate, Community shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause to be waived, for each participating Continuing Employee, any

immediately preceding the Effective Time or for benefit accruals and entitlements to cease as of or following the date immediately
preceding the Effective Time, (ii) causing the continuation on and after the Effective Time of any Contract, arrangement or

(f) As of the Effective Time, Community shall assume the Merchants Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan for
Directors, the Merchants 1996 Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, the Merchants Salary Continuation Plan and the
Merchants and Subsidiaries Amended and Restated 2008 Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors and Trustees
(collectively, the “Director Deferred Compensation Plans”) and shall continue to honor the terms and obligations thereunder unless
the Director Deferred Compensation Plans are terminated prior to the Effective Time by mutual agreement of the Parties.

(g) The provisions of this Section 4.14 are solely for the benefit of the parties hereto, and no Service Provider or any other
Person shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing herein, expressed or implied, shall
be construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan for any purpose or confer upon any Continuing Employee or any other Person
any right to employment or continued employment with any of the parties hereto or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates for any
period. Nothing in this Section 4.14 shall be construed to limit the right of Community or any of its Subsidiaries (including,

benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this
Section 4.14 be construed to require Community or any of its Subsidiaries to retain the employment of any particular Continuing
Employee for any fixed period of time following the Effective Time.

Section 4.15 Certain Policies.  Following receipt of all Requisite Regulatory Approvals and adoption of this Agreement at the
Merchants Stockholder Meeting:

(a) Merchants shall, consistent with GAAP and applicable Law and on a basis mutually satisfactory to it and Community,
modify and change its accounting, investment, loan, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan
classifications, content and size of investment portfolio, and levels of reserves and accruals) so as to be applied, in all material
respects, on a basis that is consistent with that of Community;

(b) Merchants and Community shall review the adequacy of reserves for loan losses currently established by Merchants and, if
deemed warranted by both parties under GAAP, Merchants shall make mutually acceptable changes to such reserves; and

(c) Merchants shall consult with Community with respect to determining the amount and timing of recognizing, for financial
accounting and income Tax reporting purposes, Merchants’ expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, subject to GAAP and applicable Law, Merchants shall recognize its costs
and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby at such time or times as are reasonably requested by
Community.

Section 4.16 Indemnification.  (a) From and after the Effective Time, Community shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each present and former director, officer or employee of Merchants and its Subsidiaries
(in each case, when acting in such capacity) (each, an “Indemnified Party”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and disbursements), judgments, settlements effected with the prior written consent of Community (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), fines, losses, taxes, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with or
arising out of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whether formal or informal, and whether arising before or after the Effective Time (regardless of whether the
Indemnified Party is as a named party or a participant other than as a named party, including as a witness), arising in whole or in
part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Merchants or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise in connection with any action taken or not taken at the request of Merchants or any of its Subsidiaries or
is or was serving at the request of Merchants or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of
another Person (including in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan) and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions

Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Community shall also advance expenses as incurred by such Indemnified Party
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law within thirty (30) days after a written request setting forth such expenses in
reasonable detail; provided that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable
and customary form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with Community in the Indemnified Party’s defense of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Community shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies
of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Merchants (provided, that Community may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no
less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors of Merchants or any of
its Subsidiaries arising from matters, acts or omissions which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, that Community shall not be
obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premium paid
as of the date hereof by Merchants for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any
time exceed the Premium Cap, then Community shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in Community’s good
faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the
foregoing, Merchants in consultation with Community, may (and at the request of Community, Merchants shall use its reasonable
best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6) year “tail” policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in
the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the
Premium Cap. If Merchants obtains such a “tail policy,” Community shall maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor its obligations thereunder for such six (6) year period.

(c) Subject to applicable Law, the obligations of Community and Merchants under this Section 4.16 shall not be terminated or
modified after the Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party or any other Person entitled to the
benefit of this Section 4.16 without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Party or affected Person (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 4.16).

(d) The provisions of this Section 4.16 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification, advancement, exculpation or contribution that any such individual may have under the Bylaws
of Merchants or its Subsidiaries, or by indemnification agreement, resolution, contract or otherwise. If Community or any of its
successors or assigns will consolidate with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar
transaction, then in each case to the extent the obligations set forth in this Section 4.16 are not otherwise transferred and assumed
by such successors and assigns by operation of Law or otherwise, Community will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Community will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 4.16.

Section 4.17 Merchants Debt.  (a) Community will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf
of Merchants, at or prior to the Effective Time, any supplements, amendments or other instruments required for the due assumption
of Merchants’ outstanding fixed and floating rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2034 (the “Merchants Debentures”) and (to
the extent informed of such requirement by Merchants) other agreements to the extent reasonably required by the terms of the
Merchants Debentures.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Merchants shall, and shall causes its Subsidiaries to, take all such actions reasonably requested
by Community or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merchants Debentures (i) to the extent required by the terms of the
Merchants Debentures or under applicable Law to be taken prior to the

and assist Community, upon Community’s reasonable request, in connection with an electronic and systems conversion of all
applicable data of Merchants and its Subsidiaries concerning the Loans, deposits and other assets and Liabilities of Merchants and
its Subsidiaries to the Community systems. Merchants and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate with Community in connection with the
planning for the efficient and orderly combination of the parties and the operation of Community Bank (including the former
operations of Merchants Bank) after the Bank Merger, and in preparing for the consolidation of appropriate operating functions to
be effective at the Effective Time or such later date as Community may decide. After the execution of this Agreement, Merchants
and Community shall each designate an individual to serve as liaison concerning the transfer of data processing information and
other similar operational matters. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, (i) neither Community nor
Community Bank shall be permitted to exercise control of Merchants or Merchants Bank prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
neither Merchants nor Merchants Bank shall be under any obligation to act in a manner that could reasonably be deemed to
constitute anti-competitive behavior under federal or state antitrust Laws.

the declaration of any dividends in respect of Community Common Stock and Merchants Common Stock and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the Parties that holders of Merchants Common Stock shall not receive two

have the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration and such right shall be enforceable by such holder of Merchants
Common Stock.

precedent to its obligations under this Agreement, except any condition which, if not satisfied, would result in the violation of any
Law. No waiver by a Party shall be effective unless in writing signed by a duly authorized officer of such Party.

(b) The failure of any Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the
right of such Party at a later time to enforce the same or any other provision of this Agreement. No waiver of any condition or of
the breach of any term contained in this Agreement in one or

(iv) Non-Contravention.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Stockholder does not, and the performance
by the Stockholder of his or her obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Stockholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other
obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which the Stockholder is a party or by which the Stockholder
is bound, or to the knowledge of the Stockholder, any statute, rule or regulation to which the Stockholder is subject. Except as

reliance upon the Stockholder’s execution and delivery of this Agreement and the representations and warranties of the

obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Community. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns,

Stock consistent with this Agreement, the transferor shall remain liable for the performance of all obligations of such transferor
under this Agreement.

(e) No Third Party Beneficiaries.  Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person,
other than the parties to this Agreement, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or
any provision of this Agreement except for such rights as may inure to a successor or permitted assignee under Section 6(d).

(f) No Partnership, Agency, or Joint Venture.  This Agreement is intended to create, and creates, a contractual relationship and

hereto.

(g) Entire Agreement.  This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter.

(h) Severability.  If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
or law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to
any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible

performance or injunction or such other relief as such court may deem just and proper in order to enforce this Agreement or prevent
any violation hereof and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief.
All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be
cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude the
simultaneous or later exercise of any other such rights, powers or remedies by such party.

otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto with his, her or its
obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver by
such party of his, her or its right to exercise any such right, power or remedy or to demand such compliance.

(k) Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

matters is vested in the Federal courts, any Federal court located in the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any

Board of Directors

South Burlington, VT 05403

Members of the Board:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the “Company Common Stock”), of Merchants Bancshares, Inc. (the “Company”), of the Merger Consideration
(as defined below) to be received pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), to be entered into between the
Company and Community Bank System, Inc. (the “Acquiror”). The Agreement provides for, among other things, the merger (the
“Merger”) of the Company with and into the Acquiror, pursuant to which, upon the effective time of the Merger, each share of
Company Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, except for certain shares of
Company Common Stock as specified in the Agreement, will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of each holder of
Company Common Stock, the following consideration: (i) the combination of $12.00 in cash (the “Mixed Cash Consideration”)
and 0.6741 shares (the “Mixed Stock Consideration” and, together with the Mixed Cash Consideration, the “Mixed Election
Consideration”) of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Acquiror (the “Acquiror Common Stock”); (ii) 0.963 shares of
Acquiror Common Stock (the “Stock Election Consideration”); or (iii) $40.00 in cash (the “Cash Election Consideration” and
together with the Mixed Election Consideration and the Stock Election Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). Cash will be
paid in lieu of any fractional shares. The holders of the Company Common Stock will be offered the opportunity to elect to receive
the Merger Consideration in the form of the Mixed Election Consideration, the Stock Election Consideration or the Cash Election
Consideration in exchange for each of their shares of Company Common Stock. All elections will be subject to allocation and
proration procedures described in the Agreement that are intended to ensure that 70% of the shares of Company Common Stock at
the time of the Merger are exchanged for Acquiror Common Stock and the remainder for cash. The terms and conditions of the
Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this letter have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement.

Piper Jaffray & Co., as part of its investment banking business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and
their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions. In arriving at our opinion, we have: (i)
reviewed and analyzed the financial terms of a draft of the Agreement dated October 22, 2016; (ii) reviewed and analyzed certain
financial and other data with respect to the Company and the Acquiror that was publicly available or made available to us by the
Company and by the Acquiror; (iii) reviewed and analyzed certain forward-looking information relating to the Company and the
Acquiror that was publicly available, as well as that was furnished to us by the Company and the Acquiror, including internally
prepared forecasts of the Company’s expected operating results on a stand-alone basis; (iv) reviewed and analyzed materials
detailing the Merger prepared by the Company, the Acquiror and their affiliates and by their respective legal and accounting
advisors, including the estimated amount and timing of the cost savings and related expenses and purchase accounting adjustments
expected to result from the Merger (the “Synergies”); (v) conducted discussions with members of senior management and
representatives of the Company and the Acquiror concerning the matters described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, as well as
their respective businesses and prospects before and after giving effect to the Merger and the Synergies; (vi) reviewed the current
and historical reported prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock and the Acquiror Common Stock and similar
information for certain other publicly traded companies deemed by us to be comparable to the Company and the Acquiror; (vii)
compared the financial performance of the Company and the Acquiror with that of certain other publicly traded companies that we
deemed relevant; (viii) performed certain financial analyses for the Company and the Acquiror on a pro forma combined basis
giving effect to the Merger based on assumptions relating to the Synergies; (ix) analyzed the Merger Consideration relative to the
historical trading price of Company Common Stock and the Company’s tangible book value, core deposits (deposits less all jumbo
time deposits and brokered deposits) and last twelve months earnings as of June 30, 2016 as well as analyst estimated earnings for
2017; (x) considered the current market environment generally and the commercial banking environment in particular; and (xi)
reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain business combination transactions in the depository
banking industry that we deemed relevant. In addition, we have conducted such other analyses, examinations and inquiries and
considered such other financial, economic and market criteria as we have deemed necessary in arriving at our opinion.

In arriving at our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed, without assuming liability or responsibility for independent
verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished, or otherwise made
available, to us or discussed with or reviewed by us. We have further relied upon the assurances of the management of the
Company and the Acquiror that the financial information provided has been prepared on a reasonable basis in accordance with
industry practice, and that they are not aware of any information or facts that would make any information provided to us
incomplete or misleading. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for the purpose of this opinion, we have assumed that
with respect to financial forecasts, estimates and other forward-looking information (including the Synergies) reviewed by us, that
such information has been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the management of the Company and the Acquiror as to the expected future results of operations and financial
condition of the Company and the Acquiror, respectively, to which such financial forecasts, estimates and other forward-looking
information (including the Synergies) relate and we have assumed that such results would be achieved. We express no opinion as to
any such financial forecasts, estimates or forward-looking information (including the Synergies) or the assumptions on which they
were based. We have further assumed that the Merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax
purposes. We express no opinion as to any of the legal, accounting and tax matters relating to the Merger and any other transactions
contemplated in connection therewith and have relied, with your consent, on advice of the outside legal counsel and the
independent accountants to the Company, and on the assumptions of the management of the Company and the Acquiror, as to all
accounting, legal, tax and financial reporting matters with respect to the Company, the Acquiror and the Agreement.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed that the executed Agreement will be in all material respects identical to the last
draft reviewed by us. We have relied upon and assumed without independent verification, that (i) the representations and warranties
of all parties to the Agreement and all other related documents and instruments that are referred to therein are true and correct, (ii)
each party to such agreements will fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by such
party, (iii) the Merger will be consummated pursuant to the terms of the Agreement without amendments thereto and (iv) all
conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver by any party of any conditions or obligations
thereunder. Additionally, we have assumed that all the necessary regulatory approvals and consents required for the Merger will be
obtained in a manner that will not adversely affect the Company, the Acquiror or the contemplated benefits of the Merger.

In arriving at our opinion, we have not performed any appraisals or valuations of any specific assets or liabilities (fixed,
contingent, derivative, off-balance sheet, or other) of the Company or the Acquiror, and have not been furnished or provided with
any such appraisals or valuations, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal
law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Accordingly, we express no opinion regarding the liquidation value of the
Company, the Acquiror or any other entity. We have assumed that there has been no material change in the respective assets,
financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of the Company or the Acquiror since the date of the most recent
financial data made available to us. We have also assumed in all respects material to our analysis that the Company and the
Acquiror would remain as a going concern for all periods relevant to our analysis. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
we have not: (i) conducted a review of any individual credit files of the Company or the Acquiror, nor have we evaluated the
adequacy of the loan or lease reserves of the Company or the Acquiror, (ii) conducted a review of any credit mark that may be
taken in connection with the Merger, nor have we evaluated the adequacy of any contemplated credit mark to be so taken, or (iii)
conducted a review of the collectability of any asset or the future performance of any loan of the Company or the Acquiror. We
have assumed, with your consent, that the respective allowances for loan and lease losses for the Company and the Acquiror, and
the credit mark are adequate to cover such losses and will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the Acquiror. Accordingly, we
express no opinion with respect to the foregoing. Again, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we have undertaken no
independent analysis of any pending or threatened litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other contingent
liabilities, to which the Company or the Acquiror is a party or may be subject, and at the direction of the Company and with your
consent, our opinion makes no assumption concerning, and therefore does not consider, the possible assertion of claims, outcomes
or damages arising out of any such matters. We have also assumed that neither the Company nor the Acquiror is party to any
material pending transaction, including without limitation any financing, recapitalization, acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-
off, other than the Merger and the merger of the principal banking subsidiaries of the Company and Acquiror contemplated by the
Agreement.

No company or transaction used in any analysis for purposes of comparison is identical to the Company, the Acquiror or the
Merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the comparisons is not solely mathematical; rather, it involves complex
considerations and judgments about differences in the companies and transactions to which the Company, the Acquiror and the
Merger were compared and other factors that could affect the public trading value or transaction value of the companies.

This opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions and upon the information available to us and facts
and circumstances as they exist and are subject to evaluation on the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof could
materially affect the assumptions used in preparing this opinion. We are not expressing any opinion herein as to the price at which
shares of Company Common Stock or Acquiror Common Stock may trade following announcement of the Merger or at any future
time. We have not undertaken to reaffirm or revise this opinion or otherwise comment upon any events occurring after the date
hereof and do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

We have been engaged by the Company to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger and we will receive a
transaction fee from the Company for providing our services, a significant portion of which is contingent upon the consummation
of the Merger. We will also receive a fee for rendering this opinion, which opinion fee will be credited in full towards the
transaction fee becoming payable to us upon closing of the Merger. Our opinion fee is not contingent upon the consummation of the
Merger or the conclusions reached in our opinion. The Company has also agreed to indemnify us against certain liabilities and
reimburse us for certain expenses in connection with our services. Other than our engagement by the Company in connection with
the Merger, we have not provided investment banking services to the Company, the Acquiror or entities that are affiliated with the
Company or the Acquiror over the past three years; however, we may do so in the future. In addition, in the ordinary course of our
business, we and our affiliates may actively trade securities of the Company or the Acquiror for our own account or the account of
our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. We may also, in the future, provide
investment banking and financial advisory services to the Acquiror or entities that are affiliated with the Acquiror, for which we
would expect to receive compensation.

Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, Piper Jaffray has adopted policies and procedures to establish and
maintain the independence of its Research Department and personnel. As a result, Piper Jaffray’s research analysts may hold
opinions, make statements or recommendations, and/or publish research reports with respect to the Acquiror and the Merger and
other participants in the Merger that differ from the views of Piper Jaffray’s investment banking personnel.

This opinion is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the Merger and is not
intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should act
or vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter. Except with respect to the use of this opinion in connection with the proxy
statement relating to the Merger in accordance with our engagement letter with the Company, this opinion shall not be disclosed,
referred to, published or otherwise used (in whole or in part), nor shall any public references to us be made, without our prior
written approval. This opinion has been approved for issuance by the Piper Jaffray Opinion Committee.

This opinion addresses solely the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Company Common Stock of the
proposed Merger Consideration set forth in the Agreement and does not address any other terms or agreement relating to the
Merger or any other terms of the Agreement. We were not requested to opine as to, and this opinion does not address: (i) the basic
business decision to proceed with or effect the Merger; (ii) the merits of the Merger relative to any alternative transaction or
business strategy that may be available to the Company; (iii) the Acquiror’s ability to fund the Mixed Cash Consideration and the
Cash Consideration; (iv) any other terms contemplated by the Agreement; or (v) the fairness of the Merger, or any consideration
received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities or any creditor or other constituency of the
Company. Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of compensation to any officer, director or
employee of any party to the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of
Company Common Stock in the Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation, including whether such payments
are reasonable in the context of the Merger.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and based upon such other factors as we consider relevant, it is our opinion that the
Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the date hereof.

Sincerely,

PIPER JAFFRAY & CO.

ANNEX C
 

Provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law relating to Appraisal Rights

Section 262 Appraisal rights.

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to §228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court
of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of
this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock”
and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other
instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in one or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a
corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to §251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to §251(g) of this title and, subject to
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, §251(h) of this title), §252, §254, §255, §256, §257, §258, §263 or §264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in §363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record
date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of
merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000
holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation
surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as
provided in §251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of
merger or consolidation pursuant to §§251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock
anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in
respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be
either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b.
of this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under §251(h), §253 or §267
of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the
subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by §363(a) of this title,
appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by §363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set
forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply

as nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted for the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word
“corporation” substituted for the words “constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting corporation.”

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for
the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or
consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance
with §255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this
section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such
notice a copy of this section and, if one of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of §114 of this title.
Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the
taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand
will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein
provided. Within ten days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall
notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or
consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to §228, §251(h), §253, or §267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within
ten days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are
entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all
shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section
and, if one of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of §114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given
on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the
merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such
notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by §251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving
or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the
corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s
shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such
constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the
holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of
the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on
or within ten days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following
the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, later than the later of the
consummation of the offer contemplated by §251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such
second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such
holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the

secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice
has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining
the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be
not more than ten days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior
to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is
given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any
stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights,
may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the
stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall
have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or
consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation
surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor
of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of
holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within ten days after such stockholder’s written
request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within ten days after expiration of the period for
delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of
this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of
such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this
subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was
filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and
with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition
shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register
in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or
certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such
notice shall also be given by one or more publications at least one week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the
notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting
corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who
have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares
and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon
of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of
the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall
dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of
shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the
consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was
approved pursuant to §253 or §267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in
accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such
proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair
value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger
through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger
and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation
may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided
herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by
the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation
or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the
appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the
list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of
the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be
enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder
in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as
provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to
the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the
time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written
withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days
after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written
approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the
right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw
such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving
or resulting corporation.
