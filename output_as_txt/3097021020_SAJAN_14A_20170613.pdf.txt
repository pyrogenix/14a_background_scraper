TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF SAJAN, INC.:

You are invited to attend a special meeting of the stockholders of Sajan, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Sajan,” the “Company,”
“we,” “our” or “us”), which we will hold at our offices, 625 Whitetail Boulevard, River Falls, Wisconsin 54022 (at the intersection
of South U.S. 35 and Whitetail Boulevard), on Wednesday, July 19, 2017 at 9:00 a.m. local time. We refer to such meeting,
including any adjournment or postponement thereof, as the “Special Meeting.”

At the Special Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of April 25, 2017 (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Sajan,
Amplexor USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Amplexor”), and Amplexor Falcon, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Amplexor (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Sajan (the “Merger”),
the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and Sajan will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Amplexor. In connection with the Merger, you will also be asked to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to approve,
on a non-binding and advisory basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in
connection with the Merger; and (2) a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the proposal to approve the Merger
and adopt the Merger Agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

If the Merger Agreement is adopted and the Merger is completed, Sajan will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amplexor,
and, at the effective time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger (other than shares held in Sajan’s treasury immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, which will be cancelled
and retired without payment, and any dissenting shares) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration of $5.83 per share in cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes, if any.

Our Board of Directors has unanimously adopted resolutions (i) declaring the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement fair to and in the best interests of Sajan and its stockholders, (ii) approving and
declaring advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (iii)
recommending that Sajan’s stockholders approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement and (iv) directing that the approval
of the Merger and the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Company. Accordingly, our Board
of Directors unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote (1) FOR the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the
Merger Agreement, (2) FOR the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become
payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and (3) FOR the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting,
if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum.

Your vote is very important. The Merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our
common stock vote in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement. A failure to vote your shares
of our common stock on the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement will have the same effect as a vote
AGAINST the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement.

advisory basis, certain compensation that may be paid or payable to Sajan’s named executive officers in connection with the
Merger; and (3) to consider and vote on the proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the
proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

Who Can Vote at the Meeting.  You can vote at the Special Meeting, in person or by proxy, all of the shares of Common Stock
you own of record as of June 12, 2017, which is the record date for the Special Meeting. If you own shares of Common Stock that
are registered in someone else’s name, for example, a broker, you need to direct that person to vote those shares or obtain a legal
proxy from them and vote the shares yourself at the Special Meeting. As of the record date, there were 4,796,383 shares of
Common Stock outstanding held by approximately 147 holders of record.

What Vote is Required for Approval of the Merger Agreement.  Approval of the Merger and adoption of the Merger Agreement
requires that stockholders holding a majority of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the record
date for the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on such proposal vote FOR the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the
Merger Agreement. A failure to vote your shares of Common Stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote
AGAINST the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement. If your shares are held in street name by your
broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, such failure to instruct your nominee
will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement.

Quorum.  A quorum will be present if holders of record of a majority of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding at the
close of business on the record date are present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present
at the Special Meeting, the Special Meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained.

Procedure for Voting.  You can vote shares you hold of record by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person or by
mailing the enclosed proxy card or voting by telephone or through the internet. If your shares are held in street name by a broker,
bank or other nominee, you should instruct such nominee on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by such
nominee. If you do not instruct such nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as
a vote AGAINST the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement.

How to Revoke Your Proxy.  You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
Special Meeting. To revoke your proxy, you must (a) submit a new proxy with a more recent date than that of the first proxy by (1)
following the internet voting instructions, (2) following the telephone voting instructions or (3) completing, signing, dating and
returning a new proxy card to us, which must be received by us before the time of the Special Meeting; (b) providing written notice
of revocation dated after the date of the proxy to our Corporate Secretary at Sajan, Inc., 625 Whitetail Boulevard, River Falls,
Wisconsin 54022, Attn: Corporate Secretary; or (c) if you are a registered stockholder, attending the Special Meeting in person and
delivering a proper written notice of revocation of your proxy. Attendance at the Special Meeting will not by itself revoke a
previously granted proxy. Unless you decide to vote your shares in person, you should revoke your prior proxy in the same way you
initially submitted it — that is, by internet, telephone or mail.

Recommendation of the Special Committee and the Board of Directors (page 22); Reasons for the Merger (page 22)

The Sajan Board of Directors (the “Board”) and a special committee of the Board (the “Special Committee”) have unanimously
approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Special
Committee and Board unanimously recommend that Sajan stockholders vote FOR the proposal to approve the Merger and
adopt the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For a description of the reasons considered by the Special Committee and the Board in deciding to recommend approval of the
Merger Agreement, see the section entitled “Proposal No. 1 — The Merger — Reasons for the Special Committee’s and our Board’s
Recommendation in Favor of the Merger.”

Opinion of Sajan’s Financial Advisor (page 30)

The Special Committee has retained Dougherty & Company, LLC (“Dougherty”) as its financial advisor in connection with the
potential sale of Sajan. Dougherty delivered an opinion to the Special Committee to the effect that, as of April 25, 2017 and based
on and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and
qualifications to the review undertaken, the consideration to be received in connection with the Merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of our Common Stock. The full text of Dougherty’s written opinion, which is attached as Annex B to
this Proxy Statement and which you should read carefully and in its entirety, is subject to the assumptions, limitations,
qualifications and other conditions contained in such opinion and is necessarily based on economic, capital markets and other
conditions, and the information made available to Dougherty, as of the date of such opinion.

Dougherty’s opinion was provided to the Special Committee (in its capacity as such) for its information and assistance in
connection with its evaluation of the consideration to be received in connection with the Merger. Dougherty’s opinion and any
materials provided in connection therewith did not constitute a recommendation to the Special Committee with respect to the
Merger, nor does Dougherty’s opinion constitute advice or a recommendation to any holder of our Common Stock as to how to
vote or act in connection with the Merger or otherwise. Dougherty’s opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of
view and as of the date of such opinion, of the consideration to be received in connection with the Merger by holders of our
Common Stock to the extent expressly specified in such opinion and does not address any other term, aspect or implication of the
Merger, the Merger Agreement (including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger) or any other agreement,
transaction document or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or to be entered into or amended in connection with
the Merger or any financing or other transactions related thereto.

For a description of the opinion that the Special Committee received from Dougherty, see “The Merger — Opinion of Sajan’s
Financial Advisor.”

Certain Effects of the Merger on Sajan (page 18)

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Sajan, with Sajan surviving the
Merger. Throughout this Proxy Statement, the term “Surviving Corporation” refers to Sajan as the surviving corporation following
the Merger. If the Merger is consummated, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by Sajan and Amplexor in writing and specified in the Certificate
of Merger in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”).

Effect on Sajan if the Merger is Not Completed (page 18)

If the Merger Agreement is not approved by our stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, our
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Common Stock. Instead, we will remain a public company, the
Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, a listing tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC
(“NASDAQ”), and registered under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and we will
continue to file periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Under specified circumstances,
we may be required to pay Amplexor a termination fee upon or following the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fee.”

When the Merger Becomes Effective (page 43)

The Merger Agreement provides that the closing of the Merger will occur within three business days after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to the Merger, unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated or another time or date is agreed to in
writing by the parties to the Merger Agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

As of the date of this document, the parties expect to complete the Merger during the summer of 2017. However, completion of
the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the Merger, and factors outside the control
of Sajan or Amplexor may delay the completion of the Merger, or prevent it from being completed at all. There can be no
assurances as to whether or when the Merger will be completed.

Treatment of Sajan Stock Options (page 44)

At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Common Stock that is outstanding, whether vested or unvested, shall
immediately accelerate and vest and become exercisable and will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (a) the aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock subject to such stock option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (b) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise
price of such stock option, less any taxes required to be withheld.

No Solicitation; Alternative Proposals (page 48)

The Merger Agreement restricts our ability to solicit or engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party regarding
competing transactions and the Board’s ability to change or withdraw its recommendation in favor of the Merger Agreement.
Notwithstanding these restrictions, subject to the procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Board may respond to bona
fide competing proposals, withdraw its recommendation in favor of the Merger Agreement and terminate the Merger Agreement in
order to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement — No Solicitation; Takeover Proposals”). Any action by the Board would be preceded by a recommendation of the
Special Committee.

Change in Board Recommendation (page 49)

The Special Committee and the Board unanimously recommend that our stockholders vote FOR the proposal to approve the
Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement. Nevertheless, the Board may make a change of recommendation or terminate the Merger
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement — No Solicitation; Takeover Proposals”) if, subject to the procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement, Sajan receives
a bona fide, unsolicited competing proposal that the Board, after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors, concludes
constitutes a Superior Proposal (taking into account any adjustments made by Amplexor to adjust the terms of the Merger
Agreement) or if, subject to the procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement, there has been an intervening event unrelated to a
competing proposal and, in any event, failure to take such action would be in breach of the Board’s fiduciary duties under
applicable law. Any action by the Board would be preceded by a recommendation of the Special Committee.

Interests of Sajan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 37)

When considering the recommendation by the Special Committee and the Board in favor of the Merger Agreement and the
Merger, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in
addition to, yours, including the following:

• payments in connection with stock options at the closing of the Merger, as described in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement — Treatment of Sajan Stock Options;”

• the entitlement of certain of our executive officers to receive severance payments and benefits under their respective
executive employment agreements in the event the executive officer’s employment is terminated in connection with the
Merger either by the Surviving Corporation without cause or by the executive officer for good reason;

• the expectation that Shannon Zimmerman will enter into a new employment agreement with the Surviving Corporation in
connection with closing of the Merger, as described in the section entitled “Proposal No. 1 — The Merger — Interests of
Sajan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Employment Agreements;” and

• continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the Surviving Corporation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

See the section entitled “Proposal No. 1 — The Merger — Interests of Sajan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

If the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by our stockholders and the Merger closes,
any shares of our Common Stock held by our directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding
shares of our Common Stock held by all of our other stockholders (other than Dissenting Shares or Treasury Shares).

The members of the Special Committee and the Board were aware of these interests of Sajan’s directors and executive officers
and considered them, among other matters, when approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and determining to recommend
that its stockholders vote FOR the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 40)

If you are a U.S. holder (as defined under the section entitled “Proposal No. 1 — The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will
generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable
state, local or foreign income or other tax laws. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular tax consequences
to you of the exchange of shares of our Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger in light of your particular circumstances
(including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws).

Financing of the Merger (page 37)

Amplexor’s and Merger Sub’s obligations under the Merger Agreement are not subject to any financing condition. The parent
company of Amplexor, Amplexor International S.A., has guaranteed the obligations of Amplexor under the Merger Agreement.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (page 52)

The conditions to each party’s obligations to complete the Merger include the following:

• the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders at the Special Meeting;

• no governmental entity having jurisdiction over any party to the Merger Agreement having enacted or otherwise issued any
orders or laws that make illegal, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the Merger;

• the receipt of all required consents, approval or other authorizations;

• the execution of the employment agreement with Shannon Zimmerman;

• the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement, subject to certain qualifications;
and

• the other party’s performance in all material respects of its covenants and obligations under the Merger Agreement.

In addition, the conditions to Amplexor’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to complete the Merger also include the absence of a
material adverse effect with respect to Sajan.

Termination (page 53)

The Merger Agreement may be terminated (subject, in each case, to certain limitations)

• by the mutual written consent of Sajan and Amplexor;

• by either Sajan or Amplexor, if:

• the Merger has not occurred on or before October 25, 2017;

• any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has enacted or otherwise issued any orders or laws that make illegal,
permanently enjoin or otherwise permanently prohibit the consummation of the Merger, and such order or law is final
and non-appealable;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• the required vote of our stockholders is not obtained at the Special Meeting; or

• the other party has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the Merger Agreement
such that the closing conditions would not be satisfied and such breach is incapable of being cured by October 25, 2017;

• we have entered into any agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, other than a confidentiality agreement;

• we have breached or failed to perform any of the covenants and agreements related to our non-solicitation obligations

Agreement, provided that Sajan pays the termination fee concurrently with such termination.

Termination Fee (page 54)

Following termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances generally relating to a competing transaction,
Sajan may be required to pay Amplexor a termination fee of $1.5 million.

Regulatory Approvals (page 42)

The Merger is not subject to any required regulatory approvals.

Market Prices and Dividend Data (page 58)

Our Common Stock is traded on NASDAQ, under the symbol “SAJA.” The closing sale price of our Common Stock on April
25, 2017, which was the last trading day before the Merger Agreement was executed and the Merger was publicly announced, was
$3.99 per share. On June 12, 2017 the most recent practicable date before the filing of this Proxy Statement, the closing price for
our Common Stock was $5.77 per share.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time,
we may not declare, set aside, or pay any dividend or distribution (whether in cash, stock, property or otherwise) to our
stockholders without Amplexor’s written consent. We have not historically paid any dividends on our Common Stock.

Appraisal Rights (page 60)

If the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by our stockholders at the Special Meeting
and the Merger is consummated, a Sajan stockholder who does not vote in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt
the Merger Agreement and who otherwise complies with Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to demand payment for his or
her shares and an appraisal of the value of those shares. The rights of dissenting stockholders under the DGCL are discussed in the
section entitled “Appraisal Rights.” Any exercise of appraisal rights must be in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
262 of the DGCL, which section is attached as Annex C to the Proxy Statement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER

The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the Special Meeting and the
proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all of the questions that may be
important to you as a stockholder of Sajan. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this document and
the annexes to this document, which we urge you to read carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the information
incorporated by reference into this document without charge by following the instructions under the section entitled “Where You
Can Find Additional Information.”

Q: Why am I receiving this document?

A: On April 25, 2017 Sajan entered into a definitive agreement providing for the Merger of Merger Sub, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Amplexor, with and into Sajan, with Sajan surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amplexor. You
are receiving this document in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board in favor of the proposal to approve the
Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement, the proposal to approve, on a non-binding and advisory basis, certain compensation
that may be paid or payable to Sajan’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, and the proposal to adjourn the
Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate.

Q: What is a proxy?

A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of our Common Stock. The written document describing
the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called the Proxy Statement. The document used to designate
a proxy to vote your shares of Common Stock is called the proxy card. The Board has designated Shannon Zimmerman and
Michael Rogers, and each of them with full power of substitution, as proxies for the Special Meeting.

Q: When and where is the Special Meeting?

A: The Special Meeting will be held at 625 Whitetail Boulevard, River Falls, Wisconsin (at the intersection of South U.S. 35 and
Whitetail Boulevard), on July 19, 2017, at 9:00 a.m. local time.

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?

A: Only holders of record of Common Stock as of the close of business on June 12, 2017, the record date for the Special Meeting,
are entitled to receive these proxy materials and to vote their shares at the Special Meeting. As of the close of business on the
record date, there were 4,796,383 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, held by 147
holders of record. Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the record date will be entitled to one vote on each
matter submitted to a vote at the Special Meeting.

Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?

A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you are
considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, we have sent this Proxy Statement and
your proxy card to you directly.

If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of your shares of
Common Stock held in street name. In that case, this Proxy Statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other
nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the
right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are
also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your
shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker, bank or other
nominee.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What matters will be voted on at the Special Meeting?

A: You will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

• to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement;

• to approve, on a non-binding and advisory basis, certain compensation that may be paid or payable to our named executive
officers in connection with the Merger; and

• to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the
Merger Agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

Q: What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on Sajan?

A: The proposed Merger is the acquisition of Sajan by Amplexor pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If the proposal to approve the
Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by the holders of our Common Stock and the other closing conditions
under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Sajan, with Sajan continuing
as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, Sajan will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amplexor. We will
cooperate with Amplexor to de-list our Common Stock from NASDAQ and de-register under the Exchange Act as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time of the Merger, and at such time, we will no longer be a publicly traded
company and will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If the Merger is consummated, you will not own any shares of
the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?

A: If the Merger Agreement is not approved by our stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, our
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Common Stock. Instead, we will remain a public company, the
Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue
to file periodic reports with the SEC.

Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Amplexor a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement, as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement —  Termination Fee.”

Q: What will I receive if the Merger is completed?

A: Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $5.83 per share in cash, without
interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes, if any, for each share of Common Stock that you own. For example, if you
own 100 shares of Common Stock, you will receive $583.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of Common Stock, without
interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes, if any. Upon completion of the Merger, you will not own shares in the
Surviving Corporation.

Q: What will the holders of Sajan stock options receive in the Merger?

A: At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Common Stock that is outstanding, whether vested or unvested, shall
immediately accelerate and vest and become exercisable and will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (a) the aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock subject to such stock
option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (b) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise price of such stock option, less any taxes required to be withheld.

Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?

A: We are working toward completing the Merger as soon as possible, and currently expect to consummate the Merger during the
summer of 2017. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to
conditions, including approval of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal or dissenters’ rights under Delaware Law?

A: Yes. As a holder of Common Stock, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger
if you take certain actions and meet certain conditions. See the section entitled “Appraisal Rights.”

Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?

A: If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined under the section entitled “Proposal No. 1 — The Merger —  Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of Common Stock for cash pursuant to the Merger generally will require a
U.S. Holder to recognize a gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the
amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of
Common Stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding may also apply to the cash payment pursuant to the
Merger unless the U.S. Holder or other payee provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies that such number is correct
and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules. Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that
you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of your
own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A
more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided under the section entitled
“Proposal No. 1 — The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

Q: How do I attend the Special Meeting?

A: To attend the Special Meeting, you will need to present valid photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport, and
proof of ownership of our Common Stock. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need
to present a recent brokerage statement or letter from such entity reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date. If you do
not provide photo identification or comply with the other procedures outlined in this document, you will not be admitted to the
Special Meeting. For security reasons, you and your bags may be subject to search prior to your admittance to the Special
Meeting.

If you are not a holder of record as of the record date or a beneficial holder of Common Stock held in street name, you may be
admitted to the Special Meeting only if you have a valid legal proxy from a holder of record as of the record date. You must
present that proxy, as well as a form of valid photo identification, at the entrance to the Special Meeting.

Q: How many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?

A: A quorum will be present if holders of record of a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business
on the record date are present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present at the Special
Meeting, the Special Meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained.

If you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your
shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting.

If your shares are held in street name by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote
your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee will not vote on your behalf with respect to any of the proposals, and your
shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the Special
Meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What vote of Sajan stockholders is required to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement?

A: Approval of the Merger and adoption of the Merger Agreement requires that stockholders holding a majority of the shares of our
Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date for the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on such
proposal vote FOR the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement. A failure to vote your shares of our
Common Stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST the proposal to approve the Merger
and adopt the Merger Agreement. If your shares are held in street name by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not
instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, such failure to instruct your nominee will have the same effect as a vote
AGAINST the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement.

Q: What vote of Sajan stockholders is required to approve the other proposals to be voted upon at the Special Meeting?

A: Each of the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named
executive officers of Sajan in connection with the Merger and the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum, requires a FOR vote from a majority of the
shares of Common Stock of Sajan represented at the Special Meeting, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on such
proposals. An abstention with respect to either of these proposals will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST such proposal;
however, a failure to vote your shares of Common Stock on either proposal (including a failure of your broker, bank or other
nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), assuming a quorum is present, will not have the effect of either a vote FOR or a
vote AGAINST such proposals.

Q: How does the Board recommend that I vote?

A: The Board unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote:

• FOR the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement;

• FOR the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to our
named executive officers in connection with the Merger; and

• FOR the proposal regarding adjournment of the Special Meeting.

For a discussion of the factors that the Board considered in determining to recommend the approval of the Merger Agreement,
please see the section entitled “Proposal No. 1 — The Merger — Reasons for the Special Committee’s and our Board’s
Recommendation in Favor of the Merger.” In addition, in considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the
Merger Agreement, you should be aware that some of our directors and executive officers have potential interests that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. For a discussion of these interests, see the section
entitled “Proposal No. 1 — The Merger — Interests of Sajan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Q: What will happen if stockholders do not approve the non-binding, advisory proposal on certain compensation that may
be paid or become payable to Sajan’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?

A: The inclusion of this proposal is required by SEC rules. However, the approval of this proposal is not a condition to the
completion of the Merger and the vote on this proposal is a non-binding, advisory vote by stockholders and is not binding on
Sajan or Amplexor. If the Merger Agreement is approved by Sajan stockholders and the Merger is completed, the Merger-
related compensation may be paid to Sajan’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their compensation
agreements and arrangements even if stockholders do not approve this proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of Common Stock?

A: We urge you to read this entire document carefully, including its annexes, and to consider how the Merger affects you. Your vote
is important, regardless of the number of shares of Common Stock you own. See page 2 at the beginning of this Proxy
Statement for instructions on how to vote your shares in person or by proxy over the internet, by telephone, or by mail.

Q: Can I revoke my proxy?

A: Yes. You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the Special Meeting. To revoke
your proxy, you must (a) submit a new proxy with a more recent date than that of the first proxy by (1) following the internet
voting instructions, (2) following the telephone voting instructions or (3) completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy
card to us, which must be received by us before the time of the Special Meeting; (b) providing written notice of revocation dated
after the date of the proxy to our Corporate Secretary at Sajan, Inc., 625 Whitetail Boulevard, River Falls, Wisconsin 54022,
Attn: Corporate Secretary; or (c) if you are a registered stockholder, attending the Special Meeting in person and delivering a
proper written notice of revocation of your proxy. Attendance at the Special Meeting will not by itself revoke a previously
granted proxy. Unless you decide to vote your shares in person, you should revoke your prior proxy in the same way you
initially submitted it — that is, by internet, telephone or mail.

Q: Will my shares of Common Stock held in street name or another form of record ownership be combined for voting
purposes with shares I hold of record?

A: No. Because any shares of Common Stock you may hold in street name will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder
(that is, your bank, broker or other nominee) than any shares of Common Stock you hold of record, any shares of Common
Stock held in street name will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of Common Stock you hold of record. Similarly,
if you own shares of Common Stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as
custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of Common
Stock because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of Common Stock held by a corporation or business
entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the
proxy card. Shares of Common Stock held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the
account. This means that, to ensure all your shares are voted at the Special Meeting, you should read carefully any proxy
materials received and follow the instructions included therewith.

Q: What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?

A: If your shares of Common Stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one
proxy or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards and voting instruction cards you receive (or
submit each of your proxies by telephone or the internet) to ensure that all of your shares of Common Stock are voted.

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of Common Stock before completion of the Merger?

A: In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of Common Stock through completion of the Merger.
Consequently, if you transfer your shares of Common Stock before completion of the Merger, you will have transferred your
right to receive the Merger Consideration in the Merger.

The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is June 12, 2017, which is earlier than the
consummation of the Merger. If you transfer your shares of Common Stock after the record date but before the closing of the
Merger, you will have the right to vote at the Special Meeting but not the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?

A: No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for the
Merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of Common Stock evidenced by stock certificates for the
Merger Consideration. If your shares of Common Stock are held in street name by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may
receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of
your street name shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Do not send in your certificates now.

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?

A: We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the Special Meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form
8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available
when filed. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a “safe harbor” for certain forward-looking statements. This
communication contains forward-looking statements, including statements relating to the completion of the transaction and
statements regarding Sajan’s future performance. Forward-looking statements can usually be identified by the use of words such as
“aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “evolve,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “looking ahead,” “may,”
“opinion,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “project,” “should,” “will” and other expressions which indicate future events or trends.
Forward-looking statements are likely to address matters such as, among other things, Sajan’s, Amplexor’s and their respective
affiliates’ respective or combined anticipated sales, expenses, margins, tax rates, capital expenditures, profits, cash flows, liquidity
and debt levels. These forward-looking statements are based on the companies’ current plans, expectations and assumptions and
involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to vary materially from the results and events
anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements.

These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following factors:

• the risk that we are unable to consummate the Merger within the anticipated time period, or at all, due to the failure to
obtain stockholder approval to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement or failure to satisfy the other
conditions to the completion of the Merger;

• the risk that the Merger Agreement may be terminated in circumstances requiring us to pay Amplexor a termination fee of
$1.5 million;

• the risk of any event, change or other circumstances occurring that could give rise to the termination of the Merger
Agreement;

• the risks that the proposed Merger disrupts our current plans and operations or affects our ability to retain or recruit key
employees;

• the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Merger on our business relationships (including, without limitation,
customers and suppliers), operating results and business generally;

• the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger;

• the risks related to diverting management’s or employees’ attention from ongoing business operations;

• the risks associated with limitations placed on our ability to operate our business under the Merger Agreement;

• the risk that our stock price may decline significantly if the Merger is not completed or may suffer as a result of uncertainty
surrounding the Merger;

• the risk that the Merger may not be consummated in a timely manner, if at all;

• the nature, cost and outcome of pending and future litigation and other legal proceedings, including any such proceedings
related to the Merger and instituted against us and others;

• the possibility that the companies may be adversely affected by other economic, business and/or competitive factors;

• worldwide economic conditions and their impact on customer purchasing decisions;

• rapid technological changes and competitive pressures in the industry; and

• the other risks, factors and matters described in this Proxy Statement.

Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the
forward-looking statements contained herein, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date hereof. We cannot guarantee any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as
required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
arising after such date.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SPECIAL MEETING

This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Sajan for use at the Special
Meeting to be held at the Sajan corporate offices, 625 Whitetail Boulevard, River Falls, Wisconsin 54022 (at the intersection of
South U.S. 35 and Whitetail Boulevard), at 9:00 a.m. local time on July 19, 2017.

To attend the meeting, you will need to present valid photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport, and proof of
ownership of our Common Stock. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to present a
recent brokerage statement or letter from such entity reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date.

If you are not a holder of record as of the record date or a beneficial holder of Common Stock held in street name, you may be
admitted to the meeting only if you have a valid legal proxy from a holder of record as of the record date. You must present that
proxy, as well as a form of valid photo identification, at the entrance to the meeting.

Purposes of the Special Meeting

The purposes of the Special Meeting are:

1. To approve the Merger with Merger Sub and adopt the Merger Agreement, dated as of April 25, 2017, by and among Sajan,
Amplexor, and Merger Sub;

2. To consider and vote upon, on a non-binding and advisory basis, certain compensation that may be paid or payable to
Sajan’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger; and

3. To approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the
Merger Agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

Our stockholders must approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement for the Merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to
approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement, the Merger will not occur. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to
this document as Annex A, and the material provisions of the Merger Agreement are described in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement.”

Sajan does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof. However, if any other matters are properly presented at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof
for consideration, the holders of the proxies will have discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best judgment.

Any action may be taken on any one of the foregoing proposals on the date specified above for the Special Meeting, or on any
date or dates to which the Special Meeting may be adjourned.

This Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card are first being mailed or given to stockholders on or about June 19, 2017.

Solicitation

This solicitation is made by Sajan. Sajan will pay the cost of soliciting proxies for the Special Meeting. We have engaged D.F.
King & Co., Inc., a proxy solicitation firm, to assist our Board in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting, and we expect
to pay D.F. King & Co., Inc. $10,000, plus reimbursement of out of pocket expenses. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, we
may solicit proxies personally or by telephone, facsimile or other means of communication either by D.F. King & Co., Inc. or by
our directors, officers and employees. Our directors, officers and employees will not specifically be compensated for these
activities, but they may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with this solicitation. We will also
arrange with brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward solicitation materials to the beneficial
owners of shares held of record by these persons. We will reimburse these brokerage firms, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with this solicitation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Record Date and Shares Outstanding

Only holders of record of our Common Stock at the close of business on June 12, 2017 will be entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting or any adjournments thereof. There were 4,796,383 shares of our Common Stock and no shares of our preferred stock
outstanding on the record date. Each share of Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote upon each matter to be
presented at the Special Meeting. Ballots will be passed out during the Special Meeting to all holders of record who wish to vote in
person at the Special Meeting.

If you hold your shares in street name, meaning that your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank, or other nominee as
custodian, you may vote by completing the voting instruction form provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee. You
may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee.

Quorum

A quorum, consisting of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting,
must be present in person or by proxy before any action can be taken by the stockholders at the Special Meeting. Proxies received
but marked as abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the Special
Meeting.

So long as a quorum is present at the beginning of the Special Meeting, the stockholders present may continue to transact
business until adjournment, even if enough stockholders have left the meeting to leave less than a quorum, and even if any
stockholder present in person or by proxy refuses to vote or participate in the Special Meeting. If the Special Meeting is adjourned
for any reason, the approval of the proposals may be considered and voted upon by stockholders at the subsequent reconvened
meeting. All proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original Special Meeting except for
any proxies that have been properly withdrawn or revoked.

Board Recommendation and Voting of Proxies

The Board recommends a vote:

• FOR the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement;

• FOR the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to our
named executive officers in connection with the Merger; and

• FOR the proposal regarding adjournment of the Special Meeting.

With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the Special Meeting, Shannon Zimmerman and Michael Rogers, as
the holders of the proxies, will vote as recommended by the Board or, if no recommendation is given, in their own discretion.

Each proxy returned to us by a record holder will be voted according to the instructions on the proxy. If no instructions are
indicated, the holders of the proxies will vote in accordance with the recommendations of the Board. Although the Board knows of
no other matters to be presented at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting, all proxies
returned to Sajan will be voted on any such matter according to the judgment of the holders of the proxies. If you hold your shares
in street name and do not provide instructions to your brokerage firm, your broker will not have discretionary voting power on any
proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting. Therefore, unless you attend the Special Meeting in person with a properly
executed legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your broker, bank or other
nominee will result in your shares of our Common Stock not being present at the Special Meeting and not being voted on any of the
proposals.

Vote Required

Assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock of Sajan outstanding at the
close of business on the record date and entitled to vote on such proposal is required to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger
Agreement. A failure to vote your shares of our Common Stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote
AGAINST the proposal to approve the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement. If your shares are held in street name by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do
not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, such failure to instruct your nominee will have the same effect as a vote
AGAINST the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement.

Assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock of Sajan represented at the
Special Meeting, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on such proposal is required to approve, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Sajan in connection
with the Merger and to approve the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum. An abstention with respect to either of these proposals will have the same effect
as a vote AGAINST such proposal; however, a failure to vote your shares of Common Stock on either proposal (including a failure
of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), assuming a quorum is present, will not have the effect of
either a vote FOR or a vote AGAINST such proposals.

Additionally, the vote on Merger-related named executive officer compensation is an advisory vote, which means that the result
of the vote is not binding on Sajan or Amplexor. If the Merger Agreement is approved by Sajan stockholders and the Merger is
completed, the Merger-related compensation may be paid to Sajan’s executive officers even if the stockholders fail to approve the
proposal.

Revocability of Proxies

Any person giving a proxy for the Special Meeting has the power to revoke it at any time before it is voted by:

• sending a written notice of revocation dated after the date of the proxy to our Corporate Secretary, Thomas P. Skiba, Sajan,
Inc., 625 Whitetail Boulevard, River Falls, Wisconsin 54022;

• submit a new proxy with a more recent date than that of the first proxy by using the telephone or internet proxy submission
procedures described above or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card to us, which must be received
by us before the time of the Special Meeting;

• if you are a registered stockholder, attending the Special Meeting in person and delivering a proper written notice of
revocation of your proxy.

If a broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares, you must contact it in order to find out how to revoke your proxy.
Attendance at the Special Meeting will not, in and of itself, constitute a revocation of a proxy.

Other Business

Our Board currently has no knowledge of any matters to be presented at the Special Meeting other than those referred to in this
Proxy Statement and on the enclosed form of proxy. Under our bylaws, business transacted at the Special Meeting is limited to
matters relating to the purposes stated in the notice of the Special Meeting, which is provided at the beginning of this Proxy
Statement. The enclosed form of proxy gives discretionary authority to the holders of the proxies to vote in accordance with the
recommendation of management if any other matters are presented.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROPOSAL NO. 1
APPROVAL OF THE MERGER

The description of the Merger in this section and elsewhere in this document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
complete text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this
document. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Merger that is
important to you. You are encouraged to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety.

Certain Effects of the Merger

If the Merger is approved and the Merger Agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the other conditions to the closing of
the Merger are either satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Sajan, and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub will cease. Sajan will be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and will continue its corporate existence as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Amplexor.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time of the Merger, each share of our
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time other than shares of Common Stock held in Sajan’s
treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time, which will be cancelled and retired without payment (the “Treasury Shares”),
and any shares of Common Stock held of record or beneficially by a person who has not voted in favor of approval of the Merger
and adoption of the Merger Agreement and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal rights with respect to such
shares (the “Dissenting Shares”) will be converted into the right to receive $5.83 per share in cash, without interest and subject to
applicable withholding taxes, if any. At the Effective Time, our current stockholders will cease to have ownership interests in the
Surviving Corporation or rights as its stockholders. Therefore, our current stockholders will not participate in any of our future
earnings or growth and will not benefit from any appreciation in our value.

Our Common Stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is quoted on NASDAQ under the symbol “SAJA.” As a
result of the Merger, Sajan will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amplexor.
Following the consummation of the Merger, our Common Stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and deregistered under the
Exchange Act, and Sajan will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC with respect to our Common Stock, in
each case in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations.

Effects on Sajan if the Merger is Not Completed

If the Merger Agreement is not approved by our stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, our
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of Common Stock. Instead, we will remain a public company, our
Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to
file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we expect that management will operate the business
in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that our stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks
and opportunities as they currently are, including, among other things, general industry, economic and market conditions.
Accordingly, if the Merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the
future value of your shares of our Common Stock. From time to time, our Board will evaluate and review our business operations,
properties, dividend policy and capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to
seek to identify strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. If the Merger Agreement is not approved by our stockholders
or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to us will
be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If the Merger Agreement is terminated, under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Amplexor a termination fee
as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fee.”

Background of the Merger

The following chronology summarizes certain key events and contacts that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement. It does
not purport to catalogue every conversation among our Board, members of our management, or our representatives and other
parties.

In early February 2015, Common Sense Advisory contacted Shannon Zimmerman to inquire about Sajan’s interest in exploring
M&A discussions or strategic partnership discussions with other companies. Common Sense Advisory noted that Amplexor may be
interested in pursuing an arrangement with Sajan.

On February 6, 2015, Amplexor and Sajan executed a non-disclosure agreement. At various times between February 2015 and
November 2015, Mr. Zimmerman met with Mark Evenepoel, Chief Executive Officer of Amplexor, Michael Such, Chief Financial
Officer of Amplexor, and Dr. Joachim Meinhold, Chairman of Amplexor, to discuss Sajan and Amplexor and a possible transaction
between the two, as well as to initiate and continue due diligence efforts.

On November 5, 2015 Amplexor sent a letter of interest to Sajan indicating an enterprise value of $32 million based on certain
financial assumptions and including a closing net working capital based adjustment to the purchase price and including a condition
that the Amplexor board approve the transaction and orally indicated an expectation that Mr. Zimmerman execute an employment
agreement without reflecting any terms of the employment arrangement. A $32 million enterprise value would have translated to
$6.52 per share.

On November 5, 2015 the Board met to discuss the letter of intent and formed a Special Committee consisting of Benjamin
Allen, Michael Rogers and Benno Sand, all independent directors, to consider and recommend any action on the proposal.

On November 19, 2015 Dougherty was engaged as investment banker to advise the Special Committee.

On January 24, 2016, Amplexor sent an updated letter of interest to Sajan indicating interest in acquiring Sajan at a price of
$7.44 per share based on certain financial assumptions and including a closing net working capital based adjustment to the
purchase price. The letter also expressed a condition that Mr. Zimmerman execute an employment agreement through at least 2018
without reflecting any other terms.

On February 3, 2016, Amplexor and Sajan executed a non-disclosure agreement and Amplexor commenced its due diligence
review of Sajan.

On March 10, 2016, Amplexor orally communicated to Sajan an adjustment to its proposed purchase price of $6.35, which new
price reflected anticipated financial results for Sajan’s first quarter of fiscal 2016, treatment of transaction costs and a need to adjust
certain financial assumptions. This change was presented to the Board for discussion, and Sajan orally communicated to Amplexor
it was not interested in a transaction at that valuation.

On March 30, 2016, Amplexor sent Sajan an updated letter of intent proposing to acquire Sajan at a price of $7.00 per share
based on certain revised financial assumptions and including a closing net working capital based adjustment to the purchase price.
The letter also reflected a condition that Mr. Zimmerman enter into a five-year employment agreement and contribute ten percent of
the Company’s common stock to the acquiring entity in exchange for ten percent ownership of the acquiring entity. Sajan and
Amplexor worked to negotiate a letter of intent, particularly related to the financial assumptions and closing purchase price
adjustment but were unable to reach agreement. On April 13, 2016, Amplexor withdrew its proposal and ceased further
discussions.

Between June and September 2016, Sajan and Amplexor remained in contact, with occasional meetings between Mr.
Zimmerman, Mr. Evenepoel and other Amplexor representatives.

In September 2016, Sajan reviewed its options related to engagement of a sell-side investment banker. After conversations with
and presentations from various investment bankers, Sajan re-selected Dougherty as its investment banker, which was approved by
the Special Committee on October 4, 2016, and executed an engagement letter with Dougherty on October 5, 2016.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On October 1, 2016, Amplexor sent Sajan an updated proposal to acquire Sajan at a price of $5.75 per share based on Sajan’s
financial performance to date and certain revised financial assumptions and including a closing net working capital based
adjustment to the purchase price. The letter included an expectation that Mr. Zimmerman would execute a five-year employment
agreement, without any investment in the acquiring entity and without reflecting any other terms of the employment arrangement.

On October 4, 2016, the Board appointed Thomas Magne to the Special Committee.

On October 6, 2016, formal discussions, through Dougherty began with three parties interested in acquiring Sajan — Amplexor,
Party B and Party C. Amplexor was informed that it would be a part of this overall process.

On October 10, 2016, Sajan and Dougherty began preparation of materials for outreach to a broad list of potential interested
parties and population of a datasite. Dougherty also discussed the formal process with Party B.

The datasite was opened to a working group on October 11, 2016, and Sajan and Dougherty continued to work on the launch of
a broader process and expansion of a list of potential strategic buyers.

From October 12, 2016 through October 14, 2016, Dougherty continued to work with Party B on its general level of interest.

From October 17, 2016 through October 28, 2016, Dougherty initiated communications with a total of 30 possible strategic
buyers and 63 possible financial buyers. A total of 11 possible strategic buyers and 20 possible financial buyers executed non-
disclosure agreements. None of the non-disclosure agreements with Amplexor or any of the other potential buyers contained a
stand-still, “don’t ask, don’t waive” provision or any other restriction on their ability to submit acquisition proposals. Discussions
with Amplexor, Party B and Party C continued during this time.

On November 1, 2016, Party B submitted an indication of interest with an indicated valuation range of between $5.23 and
$5.75 per share. Party C ultimately indicated it would not pursue a transaction and no other indications of interest were submitted.

From November 10, 2016 through December 8, 2016, Party B conducted its due diligence review of Sajan, and, on December
9, 2016, Party B conducted a site visit to Sajan’s headquarters. Party B submitted a revised indication of interest at $5.75 per share
on December 19, 2016.

From December 19, 2016 through December 28, 2016, discussions continued between Dougherty, Sajan, Amplexor and Party B
to obtain best and final indications from each of Amplexor and Party B.

On December 29, 2016 Amplexor submitted a revised letter of intent with an updated price indicated at $6.14 per share based
on certain financial assumptions and including a closing net working capital based adjustment to the purchase price and the same
expectation that Mr. Zimmerman execute a five-year employment agreement without any investment or other equity participation
and without any other terms. The Special Committee met on December 30, 2016 to discuss the price indications received from
Amplexor and Party B. The Special Committee determined that negotiations should continue with Amplexor.

From December 30, 2016 through January 5, 2017 discussions continued between Amplexor and Sajan regarding terms of the
letter of intent and expected timing for a potential transaction.

On January 5, 2017 Amplexor submitted a revised letter of intent with the same terms as the December 29, 2016 letter, except it
did not contain a closing purchase price adjustment and it included a provision granting exclusivity until February 28, 2017.

On January 6, 2017 the Special Committee met to discuss the progress of negotiations with Amplexor, Party B and to reconfirm
no other parties were pursuing a proposal. Party B orally indicated that it could increase its proposed price to $6.25 per share if
Sajan undertook certain significant and immediate expense reductions in the first quarter of 2017 and would be subject to Party B
obtaining financing for its verbal proposal. The Special Committee determined the need for financing created a significant risk to
the consummation of Party B’s proposal including to the extent that a transaction with Party B would not close

and the significant and immediate expense reductions would unduly hamper Sajan’s business plan and, therefore, the proposal from
Amplexor was superior to the proposal from Party B and the Special Committee authorized the execution of a letter of intent with
Amplexor.

On January 6, 2017, Sajan executed the letter of intent with Amplexor, which called for Amplexor to acquire Sajan at a price of
$6.14 per share and granted exclusivity through February 28, 2017. Party B was informed that Sajan had executed a letter of intent
with another party and did not further communicate with Sajan. Amplexor then commenced a detailed financial and legal due
diligence review of Sajan.

Following execution of the letter of intent with Amplexor, Mr. Zimmerman began considering independent counsel to represent
him in connection with his proposed employment agreement. On March 15, 2017 Mr. Zimmerman engaged Briggs & Morgan, P.A.

On March 1, 2017 Amplexor requested an extension to the exclusivity period for the letter of intent, which initially expired on
February 28, 2017. On March 6, 2017 Quarles & Brady, LLP (“Quarles”), counsel to Amplexor, delivered an initial draft of the
Merger Agreement to Fredrikson & Byron, P.A. (“Fredrikson”), counsel to Sajan. On March 10, 2017 Sajan, with a letter dated
March 1, 2017, agreed to grant an extension to the exclusivity period through April 5, 2017.

From March 10, 2017 through March 24, 2017, Amplexor’s due diligence review of Sajan continued and negotiation of the
Merger Agreement between Quarles and Fredrikson commenced.

On March 29, 2017, Mr. Zimmerman visited Amplexor in Lisbon, during which time meetings were held to discuss the
transaction and Sajan’s ongoing financial performance. Amplexor verbally communicated to Mr. Zimmerman that, based on
Sajan’s fiscal 2017 first quarter results, Amplexor’s views related to the likelihood of Sajan achieving its full 2017 targeted
financial results, and some results of their due diligence review, principally related to higher than expected transaction costs and the
value of Sajan’s net operating loss carryforwards, it was lowering its proposed purchase to $5.87 per share.

From March 30, 2017 through April 7, 2017, negotiations continued toward final terms for the Merger Agreement. On April 5,
2017, the Special Committee met to discuss the progress on negotiations of the Merger Agreement and the current pricing
negotiations. On April 6, 2017, a revised draft Merger Agreement reflecting certain benefits to Sajan was received with a price of
$5.83 per share. On April 6, 2017 a draft employment agreement was delivered to Mr. Zimmerman.

Final negotiations on the Merger Agreement occurred from April 6, 2017 through April 24, 2017 and on April 20, 2017 Mr.
Zimmerman accepted the negotiated terms of his proposed employment agreement, the execution of which would be a condition to
closing and a copy of which is attached to this Proxy Statement. On April 11, 2017, Amplexor advised Sajan that its board of
directors was reviewing the final terms of the proposed Merger but would not be in a position to approve it until at least April 21,
2017. On April 20, 2017, Amplexor advised Sajan that it was purchasing insurance to cover representations and warranties in the
Merger Agreement and the insurer had additional due diligence questions to address before Amplexor would be in a position to
execute the Merger Agreement. From April 20, 2017 through April 24, 2017, Sajan provided additional information to Amplexor.

On April 21, 2017, the Board and the Special Committee each met to discuss the proposed terms of the Merger Agreement and
the Merger. Dougherty presented its preliminary analysis on the fairness of the proposed Merger and Fredrikson advised the
directors on their fiduciary duties in connection with considering transactions such as the Merger and reviewed in detail the
proposed Merger Agreement. Each of the Special Committee and the Board conducted a lengthy discussion on the benefits and
risks of signing the Merger Agreement and recommending that stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger
Agreement.

Late in the afternoon of April 24, 2017, Amplexor informed Sajan that Amplexor’s board and shareholders had approved the
Merger Agreement.

On April 25, 2017, late in the afternoon, the Board and the Special Committee reconvened and received an update from
Dougherty on analysis of the fairness of the proposed Merger Dougherty noted that there was no change from its prior analysis,
provided updated information on the premium to market price represented

by the Merger Consideration and rendered its oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 25, 2017, to the
effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, factors, qualifications and limitations set forth in such
opinion, the $5.83 per share Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to Sajan’s stockholders. Fredrikson then
updated the Board and the Special Committee on the final terms of the proposed Merger Agreement and the directors further
discussed the proposed Merger.

At its meeting on April 25, 2017, the Special Committee (i) unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Sajan and its stockholders,
(ii) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, and (iii) recommended that Sajan’s stockholders approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement.

At its meeting on April 25, 2017, the Board then, among other things, (i) unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Sajan and its
stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, (iii) recommended that Sajan’s stockholders approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement and (iv)
directed that the approval of the Merger and the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to Sajan’s stockholders.

Subsequent to these meetings, Sajan notified Amplexor that the Board had unanimously approved the Merger and the Merger
Agreement. Late in the afternoon on April 25, 2017, Sajan and Amplexor executed the Merger Agreement and on April 26, 2017,
prior to the opening of the stock markets, Sajan and Amplexor issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger
Agreement.

On May 16, 2017 a complaint against Sajan and certain other parties was filed in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Wisconsin. The complaint, captioned Robert Berg, Individually and On Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated
v. Sajan, Inc., et al. Case No. 17-CV-379, names as defendants Sajan as well as members of Sajan’s Board of Directors (the “Sajan
Board”) and Amplexor. This action purports to be a class action brought by a shareholder alleging, among other things, that Sajan
and the Sajan Board omitted material information from the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on May 12, 2017 in
violation of Section 14(a), Rule 14a-9 and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The outcome of this litigation cannot be predicted
with certainty; however, Sajan believes that the lawsuit is without merit and Sajan intends to vigorously defend against it. A
preliminary injunction could delay or jeopardize the completion of the transactions, and an adverse judgment granting permanent
injunctive relief could indefinitely enjoin completion of the transactions.

Reasons for the Special Committee and our Board’s Recommendation in Favor of the Merger

The Special Committee and the Board each met on April 25, 2017 to consider the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

The Special Committee (i) unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Sajan and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared
advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (iii)
recommended that Sajan’s stockholders approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement.

Following the Special Committee’s determination, and based on that and the other factors described below, the Board, among
other things, (i) unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Sajan and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the
Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (iii) recommended that Sajan’s
stockholders approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement and (iv) directed that the approval of the Merger and the
adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to Sajan’s stockholders.

In determining that the Merger Agreement and the Merger are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Sajan and our
stockholders, the Special Committee and the Board considered the positive factors and potential benefits of the Merger Agreement
and the Merger, the risks and potentially negative factors relating

TABLE OF CONTENTS

to the Merger Agreement and the Merger and the factors relating to procedural safeguards in place to protect our stockholders,
which our Board expressly adopts for purposes of its recommendation, each of which is discussed in more detail below.

Expected Benefits of the Merger

The Merger is expected to result in benefits to all of our stockholders. In the course of reaching its determination and making
the recommendation described above, the Special Committee and the Board considered a number of factors and a substantial
amount of information. The Special Committee held numerous telephonic and in-person meetings following the initial contact from
Amplexor. In addition, between these meetings, there were additional informal discussions among members of the Special
Committee and between or among directors, Sajan’s management and legal and financial advisors.

The principal factors and benefits that the Special Committee and the Board believes support their conclusion are set forth
below:

• Financial Condition and Prospects of Sajan.  The Special Committee and the Board considered a number of factors
impacting the business, operations, prospects, business strategy, properties and assets of Sajan, including Sajan’s current
and projected results of operations and financial condition. For a discussion of the projected results of operations and
financial conditions considered by the Special Committee and the Board, see below under the caption “Certain Projected
Financial Information.” With respect to Sajan’s historical performance, the Special Committee and the Board considered
Sajan’s historical share price performance, management’s prior projections and Sajan’s historical financial performance.
The Special Committee and the Board also discussed the expected benefits from continuing to execute our business plan
and strategy, as reflected in management’s projections, as well as the potential risks and uncertainties of achieving the
potential benefits of the goals reflected in such business plan relative to the certainty of the Merger Consideration payable
to stockholders in the Merger. Based on Sajan’s standalone business plan and risks associated with achieving such plan, the
Special Committee and the Board believe that the Merger Consideration appropriately reflects the long-term value creation
potential of Sajan’s business plan.

• Public Company Costs.  The Special Committee and the Board considered the high costs of being a public company relative
to the size of Sajan’s earnings and asset base; the substantial and increasing cost of being a public company, including
accounting fees, legal fees, salaries and other expenses, as well as significant time and attention from Sajan management;
the impact of such costs on the potential future trading price of the Common Stock; and the current lack of benefits of being
a stand-alone public company, including in terms of raising capital from external sources and in pursuing acquisitions with
Common Stock.

• Strategic Alternatives.  The Special Committee and the Board reviewed possible alternatives to the Merger (including
continuing with Sajan’s current business plan, pursuing possible acquisitions, or pursuing other potential purchasers) and
the perceived risks and benefits of any such alternatives, including the timing and likelihood of consummating any such
alternative and the impact upon Sajan employees and customers. As a result of their review and considering a number of
factors described herein, the Special Committee and the Board determined that the Merger presents a superior opportunity
to any such alternatives.

• Historical Trading Prices; Premium to Market Price.  The Special Committee and the Board considered the relationship of
the Merger Consideration to historical market prices of the Common Stock on NASDAQ. In this regard, the Special
Committee and the Board observed that the Merger Consideration represented approximately a 53% premium over the
closing price of the Shares on NASDAQ on April 24, 2017, the last trading day before the Special Committee and Board
meetings and approximately a 61.4%, 56.0%, 56.0% and 48.4% premium over Sajan’s average stock price over the thirty,
sixty, ninety and two hundred day periods, respectively, ended April 24, 2017.

• Financing.  The Special Committee and the Board considered the likelihood that the Merger would be completed based on,
among other things, the absence of a financing condition or any condition requiring third-party consents and Amplexor’s
representation of its financial strength, which the Special

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Committee and the Board believed contributes to the certainty of closing and the certainty that all stockholders will receive
the all-cash Merger Consideration without significant delay following the approval of the Merger and the adoption of the
Merger Agreement by the stockholders.

• Certainty of Value of Offer Price.  The Special Committee and the Board considered the form of consideration payable to
stockholders in the Merger and the certainty of value, although taxable, of such cash consideration. The Special Committee
and the Board determined that the substantial immediate premium offered by Amplexor was preferable for stockholders as
compared to a speculative return dependent upon Sajan’s per share price rising above $5.83 in the future.

• Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor.  The Special Committee and the Board considered the opinion of Dougherty,
dated April 25, 2017, to the Special Committee and the Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of
such date, of the $5.83 per share cash consideration to be paid in the Merger to holders of Common Stock (other than
Treasury Shares or Dissenting Shares), which opinion was based on and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions
made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Dougherty as more fully described
below under the caption “Opinion of Sajan’s Financial Advisor.”

• Terms of the Merger Agreement.  The Special Committee and the Board reviewed, considered and discussed with Sajan’s
management and advisors the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The Special Committee and the Board
believe that the provisions of the Merger Agreement are in the best interests of Sajan and our stockholders. In particular:

• No Financing Condition.  The Special Committee and the Board considered the representation and covenant of
Amplexor that Amplexor will have, prior to the Effective Time, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration contemplated by the Merger Agreement and to perform the other obligations of Amplexor and Merger
Sub contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

• Fiduciary Out.  The Special Committee and the Board considered the potential for unsolicited competing proposals
following execution of the Merger Agreement. The Special Committee and the Board considered the Board’s ability,
under the “fiduciary out” provisions of the Merger Agreement, to consider an unsolicited Takeover Proposal and, in
certain circumstances, to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a bona fide written proposal determined to be a
Superior Proposal in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement upon payment of a termination fee, which
termination fee the Special Committee and the Board determined was not unduly onerous.

• Appraisal Rights.  The Special Committee and the Board took into account that if the Merger is consummated a
stockholder will have certain rights under Delaware law to dissent from the Merger and obtain payment in cash for the
“fair value” of such stockholder’s shares of Common Stock, if certain procedures are properly followed by the
stockholder.

• Customary Terms.  The Special Committee and the Board believe that the Merger Agreement contains customary terms
and that the conditions to Amplexor’s obligation to consummate the Merger are not unduly onerous.

Potentially Negative Factors

The Special Committee and the Board also considered potential risks associated with the Merger in connection with its
evaluation of the Merger, including:

• Continuing Management.  The Special Committee and the Board considered the fact that members of management,
including Shannon Zimmerman, may enter into certain agreements, arrangements or understandings with Amplexor
regarding employment with the Surviving Corporation or Amplexor. See below under the caption “Interests of Sajan’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

• Termination by Amplexor.  The Special Committee and the Board considered the risk that Amplexor may terminate the
Merger Agreement and not complete the Merger in certain limited circumstances, including, subject to certain conditions, if
the Board has changed its recommendation in favor of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, we have breached or failed to perform any of the covenants and
agreements related to our non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement, or we have breached any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the Merger Agreement such that the closing conditions would
not be satisfied and such breach is incapable of being cured by October 25, 2017.

• Termination Fee.  The Special Committee and the Board reviewed and discussed the termination fee that could become
payable by Sajan pursuant to the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including as a result of Sajan’s acceptance
of a bona fide written proposal determined to be a Superior Proposal in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, pursuant to the Merger Agreement’s “fiduciary out” provisions.

• Pre-Closing Covenants.  The Special Committee and the Board considered that, under the terms of the Merger Agreement,
Sajan has agreed that it will conduct its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and, subject
to specified exceptions, that Sajan will not take certain specified actions related to the conduct of its business without the
prior written consent of Amplexor. The Special Committee and the Board further considered that these terms may limit the
ability of Sajan to pursue or undertake business opportunities that could arise prior to the consummation of the Merger.

• Operations During Pendency and Failure to Close.  The Special Committee and the Board considered that the
announcement and pendency of the transaction may divert management and employee attention from the day-to-day
operations of Sajan and may negatively impact existing employee, customer, vendor and supplier relationships, and the risk
that the Merger might not be completed and the resulting effect on:

• Sajan’s operating results, particularly in light of the costs incurred in connection with the Merger, including the potential
requirement to make a termination payment;

• the ability to attract and retain key personnel; and

• relationships with customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners of Sajan.

• Tax Treatment.  The Special Committee and the Board considered that the consideration to be received by our stockholders
in the Merger would generally be taxable to such stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Other Factors

In addition to the above, the Special Committee and the Board also considered the following factors:

• Conflicts of Interest.  The Special Committee and the Board considered the potential conflicts of interest of certain Sajan
officers and directors. See below under the caption “Interests of Sajan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

• Liquidation Value; Net Book Value; Other Factors Not Considered.  The Special Committee and the Board did not consider
the liquidation value of Sajan, because the Special Committee and the Board considered Sajan to be a viable, going concern
with its value derived from cash flows from its continuing operations rather than from the value of its assets. Moreover, the
Special Committee and the Board did not consider net book value, which is an accounting concept, because they believe
that net book value does not present a meaningful view of Sajan and its business since Sajan’s value is derived from cash
flows generated by continuing operations.

Procedural Fairness

The Special Committee and the Board considered the following material factors in concluding that the Merger is procedurally
fair to our unaffiliated stockholders:

• Process Conducted by Dougherty.  As discussed above, Dougherty conducted a thorough process and review of possible
alternative purchasers. The Special Committee was provided with ongoing updates as to the state of the process and was
able to evaluate potential alternatives.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• Special Committee and Board Authority.  The Special Committee and the Board had no obligation to recommend the
approval of the Merger and had the power to reject the Merger on behalf of Sajan. The Special Committee and the Board
met telephonically or in person many times and were assisted by Sajan’s management and legal and financial advisors. The
Special Committee and the Board held extensive discussions, with the assistance of the Company’s advisors, and with
representatives of Amplexor, regarding the Merger Consideration and other terms of the Merger.

• Interests of the Special Committee and the Board.  No Special Committee members have interests in the Merger different
from those of stockholders generally, other than with respect to the vesting of unvested options awards as recipients of such
awards under Sajan’s equity incentive plans and other than the compensation payable pursuant to existing director
compensation arrangements and expense reimbursement, none of which are contingent upon the consummation of the
Merger or the Special Committee’s recommendation of the Merger, and their indemnification and liability insurance rights
under the Merger Agreement. Mr. Zimmerman is expected to enter into an employment agreement effective upon the
closing of the Merger, but the terms of such employment agreement are substantially the same as those of his current
employment agreement. See below under the caption “Interests of Sajan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

The Board and the Special Committee based their ultimate decisions on its business judgment that the benefits of the Merger to
our stockholders outweigh negative considerations. The Special Committee and the Board determined that the Merger represents
the best reasonably available alternative to enhance stockholder value with the least risk of non-completion.

The foregoing discussion of information and factors considered by the Special Committee and the Board is not intended to be
exhaustive and may not include all of the factors considered by the Special Committee or the Board. The Special Committee and
the Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular
factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination, and did not quantify or assign any relative or specific weights to
the various factors that it considered in reaching its determination that the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Sajan and our stockholders. Rather, the
Special Committee and the Board conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above and considered the factors overall to
be favorable to, and supportive of, its determination. In addition, individual members of the Special Committee and the Board may
have given different weight to different factors. It should be noted that this explanation of the reasoning of the Special Committee
and the Board and certain information presented in this section, is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, that information should
be read in light of the factors discussed in “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”

Certain Projected Financial Information

Dougherty Forecasts

Sajan does not make public forecasts or projections as to its future financial performance due to the unpredictability of the
underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the following projected financial information (the “Dougherty Forecasts”) was
provided to Dougherty for use in connection with its fairness opinion. The Dougherty Forecasts are based on an anticipated 10%
revenue growth rate per year, which is consistent with the Company’s internal planning model.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The table below presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Expenses to the most comparable GAAP measure, operating
expenses, for each of the years provided in the Amplexor Forecasts.

Adjusted Operating Expenses  $ 9,608.0  $ 10,184.0  $ 10,796.0 

We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by taking net income calculated in accordance with GAAP and adding interest expense,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring and deal-related costs, and stock-based compensation. We calculate
Adjusted Operating Expenses by taking operating expenses and subtracting depreciation and amortization, restructuring and deal-
related costs, and stock-based compensation. We believe that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful
information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and
results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for
trend analyses and for budgeting and planning purposes. These measures are also used in financial reports prepared for
management and our Board. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors
to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other companies, many of
which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Our management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in
isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-
GAAP financial measures are that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our
consolidated financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by
management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In
order to compensate for these limitations, management presents these non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP
results. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial
measures and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Important factors that may affect actual results and results of Sajan’s operations, or could lead to the Forecasts not being
achieved include, but are not limited to our rate of growth in the global multilingual content delivery industry; our ability to
effectively manage our growth; lack of acceptance of any existing or new solutions we offer; our ability to continue increasing the
number of our customers or the revenues we derive from our recurring revenue customers; economic weakness and constrained
globalization spending by businesses operating in international markets; our ability to effectively develop new solutions that
compete effectively with the solutions that our current and future competitors offer; risk of increased regulation of the Internet and
taxes imposed on business conducted via the Internet; availability of capital on acceptable terms to finance our operations and
growth; risks of conducting international commerce, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in government
policies or regulations, longer payment cycles, trade restrictions, economic or political instability in foreign countries where we
may increase our business and reduced protection of our intellectual property; our ability to add sales and marketing, research and
development or other key personnel who are able to successfully sell or develop our solutions; and other factors that are more fully
described in Sajan’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The assumptions upon which the
Forecasts were based necessarily involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic and competitive
conditions, financial market conditions and conditions in the industry in which Sajan operates, all of which are difficult to predict
and many of which are beyond the control of Sajan and its management. The Forecasts also reflect assumptions as to certain
business decisions that are subject to change.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Forecasts will be realized, and actual results may vary materially from those
shown. The inclusion of the Forecasts in this Proxy Statement should not be regarded as an indication that Sajan or any of its
affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners, members or representatives considered or consider the Forecasts to be necessarily
predictive of actual future events, and the internal financial forecasts should not be relied upon as such. Neither Sajan nor any of its
affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners, members or representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not
differ from the Forecasts, and, except to the extent required by law, Sajan undertakes no obligation to update or otherwise revise or
reconcile the Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date such Forecasts were generated or to reflect the occurrence of
future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Forecasts are shown to be in error. Neither Sajan
nor any of its affiliates intends to make publicly available an update or other revisions to the Forecasts. Neither Sajan nor any of its
affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners, members or representatives has made or makes any representation to any
stockholder or other person regarding the ultimate performance of Sajan compared to the information contained in the Forecasts or
that the Forecasts will be achieved. Sajan has made no representations to Amplexor or any of its affiliates concerning the Forecasts.

All projections, including the Forecasts, are forward-looking statements. These and other forward-looking statements are
expressly qualified in their entirety by the risks and uncertainties identified above and the cautionary statements contained in
Sajan’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.

Shareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Forecasts included in this Proxy Statement.

Opinion of Sajan’s Financial Advisor

Dougherty rendered its opinion to the Special Committee that, as of April 25, 2017, and based upon and subject to the factors
and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration of $5.83 per share in cash per share of Common Stock to be paid to the
holders of Sajan common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair to such stockholders from a financial point of view.

The full text of the written opinion of Dougherty, dated April 25, 2017, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached to this
Proxy Statement. Dougherty provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the Special Committee in connection
with its consideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Dougherty opinion is not a
recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Sajan Common Stock should vote with respect to such transactions or
any other matter.

In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Dougherty reviewed,
among other things:

• the Merger Agreement;

• Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Sajan for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016;

• certain Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Sajan;

• certain other communications from Sajan to its stockholders;

• certain publicly available research analyst reports for Sajan; and

• the Dougherty Forecasts described under “Certain Projected Financial Information” above.

Dougherty also held discussions with members of the senior management of Sajan regarding their assessment of the past and
current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Sajan; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for
shares of Sajan Common Stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for Sajan with similar information for
certain other companies whose securities are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations
in industries deemed relevant by Dougherty; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as
Dougherty deemed appropriate.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For purposes of rendering the opinion described above, Dougherty, with Sajan’s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy
and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and other information provided to, discussed with or
reviewed by, Dougherty, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Dougherty
assumed, with Sajan’s consent, that the Dougherty Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of Sajan’s management, and Sajan approved the Dougherty Forecasts for Dougherty’s use in
connection with Dougherty’s fairness opinion. Dougherty did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets or liabilities) of Sajan or any of its subsidiaries and
was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Dougherty assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents
and approvals necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be obtained without
any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in any way meaningful to its
analysis. Dougherty also assumed that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated on the terms
set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any
way meaningful to its analysis.

Dougherty’s opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Sajan to engage in the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, or the relative merits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as compared to any
strategic alternatives that may be available to Sajan; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters.
Dougherty’s opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Sajan Common Stock, as of April
25, 2017, of the Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Dougherty’s opinion does not
express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or entered
into, or amended in connection with, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the fairness of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of
any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Sajan. Dougherty’s opinion does not express any view on, and
does not address, the fairness of the amount, or nature of, any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or
employees of Sajan, or class of such persons, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, whether
relative to the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Sajan Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or
otherwise. Dougherty did not express any opinion as to the impact of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on
the solvency or viability of Sajan or the ability of Sajan’s affiliates to pay their respective obligations when they come due.
Dougherty’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market, and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Dougherty as of, the date of the opinion and Dougherty assumed no responsibility for updating,
revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Dougherty to the Special Committee in connection
with rendering the fairness opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete
description of the financial analyses performed by Dougherty, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative
importance or weight given to those analyses by Dougherty. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete
description of Dougherty’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it
is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before April 25, 2017, and is not necessarily indicative of
current market conditions.

Selected Companies Analysis

Dougherty reviewed and compared certain financial information for Sajan to corresponding financial information, ratios and
public market multiples for the following publicly traded corporations in the content translation services sector that are subject to
similar market dynamics to that of Sajan:

• Teleperformance SE

• RWS Holdings plc

• SDL plc

• Keyword Studios plc

• Appen Ltd

Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to Sajan, the companies included were chosen because they are
publicly traded companies with operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of Sajan.
Dougherty calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios based on estimates from FactSet Research Systems, Inc.
(“FactSet”), the Dougherty Forecasts and market information. With respect to each of the selected companies, Dougherty calculated
such company’s enterprise value (“EV”), which is the market capitalization of such company that Dougherty derived based on the
closing price of the shares of the applicable company’s common stock and the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a
fully diluted basis based upon public information available as of April 24, 2017, plus the book value of debt less the book value of
liquid cash and cash equivalents based upon public information available as of April 24, 2017, as a multiple of estimated revenue,
and a multiple of

respectively, for the trailing twelve months (“TTM”) period ended March 31, 2017 and the calendar years 2017 and 2018, as
provided by FactSet. With respect to Sajan, Dougherty calculated EV as a multiple of estimated revenue and estimated EBITDA for
the TTM period ended March 31, 2017 and calendar years 2017 and 2018 as provided by the Forecast. Sajan’s EV at the
transaction price was $24.6 million and was calculated based on the Merger Consideration of $5.83 and the estimated number of
the shares of Sajan Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis as of March 31, 2017, plus the book value of debt ($0) and
less the book value of liquid cash and cash equivalents ($3.7 million) as of March 31, 2017. Information regarding the fully diluted
share count, the book value of debt, and liquid cash and cash equivalents was obtained from Sajan management. A summary of
these analyses are as follows:

Dougherty determined that it was appropriate to apply reference multiples that represent a discount to the mean and median
values of the selected companies in order to reflect Sajan’s revenue growth profile, margin profile, smaller size, and limited
liquidity. The analysis resulted in a range of value indications of $2.59 to $6.03 per share of Sajan Common Stock, as noted in the

since 2014 involving companies with similar profiles to that of Sajan.

For each of the selected transactions, Dougherty calculated and compared aggregate enterprise value as a multiple of the then-
TTM revenue and as a multiple of the then-TTM EBITDA. Information regarding the transactions was obtained from FactSet,
company press releases, SEC filings and other publicly available sources.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Dougherty analyzed each of the selected transactions and determined that it was appropriate to apply reference multiples that
represent a discount to the mean and median values of the selected transactions to reflect Sajan’s revenue growth profile, margin
profile, and smaller size. The analysis resulted in a range of value indications of $2.78 to $5.98 per share of Sajan Common Stock,
as noted in the table below:

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Using the Dougherty Forecasts, Dougherty performed a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing Sajan’s projected unlevered free
cash flows (defined as after-tax operating income, plus depreciation and amortization, plus stock-based compensation, less
increases in net working capital (excluding cash and debt) and capital expenditures), from 2017 to 2021, as provided by Sajan’s
management. In such analysis, Dougherty calculated the present values of the unlevered free cash flows from fiscal year 2017
through 2021 by discounting such amounts at rates ranging from 20% to 22%, which are estimates of Sajan’s weighted average cost
of capital based on (i) the risk free interest rate (that is, the 10-year treasury note yield), (ii) the equity market risk premium
(Damodaran – April 1, 2017), (iii) a small company discount to reflect Sajan’s small size and limited liquidity, (iv) equity betas for
technology services companies with market capitalizations under $125 million per FactSet, and (v) a marginal tax rate of 35.0%.
Dougherty calculated the present values of the unlevered free cash flows beyond 2021 based on terminal year EBITDA multiples
ranging from 5.0x to 7.0x and discounting the resulting terminal values at rates ranging from 20% to 22%. The summation of the
present values of the unlevered free cash flows and the present values of the terminal values produced equity values ranging from
$4.96 to $6.49 per Share, as compared to the Merger Consideration of $5.83 per share. Dougherty compared these implied per
share equity values with the Merger Consideration in rendering its opinion.

Unlevered free cash flows, terminal year EBITDA and the applicable range of terminal values for Sajan was derived from the
Dougherty Forecasts for use in preparing the discounted cash flow analysis. The unlevered free cash flows, terminal year EBITDA
and applicable ranges of terminal values information is summarized below.

Summary and Conclusion

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole,
could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Dougherty’s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Dougherty considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis
considered by it. Rather, Dougherty made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment
after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly
comparable to Sajan or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Dougherty prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Special Committee as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, as of April 25, 2017, of the Merger Consideration. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do
they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future
results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond
the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Sajan, Dougherty or any other person assumes responsibility if future
results are materially different from those forecast.

The $5.83 in cash per share of Sajan Common Stock to be paid to the holders of Sajan Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
Agreement was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Sajan and Amplexor and was approved by the Special
Committee. Dougherty provided advice to Sajan during these negotiations. Dougherty did not, however, recommend any specific
amount of consideration to Sajan or the Special Committee or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only
appropriate consideration for the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

As described above, Dougherty’s opinion was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Special Committee in
making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description
of the analyses performed by Dougherty in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
written opinion of Dougherty attached to this proxy statement.

Dougherty and its affiliates are engaged in investment banking, sales and trading, equity research, proprietary investments, asset
management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Dougherty and its
affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with
which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives,
loans and other financial instruments of Sajan, any of their respective affiliates and third parties or any currency or commodity that
may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Dougherty acted as financial advisor to Sajan in
connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
During the three year period ended April 25, 2017, Dougherty provided certain investment banking services to Sajan in connection
with the sale of Sajan’s Common Stock in a follow-on offering, for which Dougherty received aggregate compensation equal to
$133,700. During that period, Dougherty did not provide any

investment banking services to Amplexor, but Dougherty may in the future provide financial advisory or other services to
Amplexor and its affiliates, for which Dougherty may receive compensation.

The Special Committee selected Dougherty as its financial advisor because the firm has substantial experience with Sajan’s
business and the content translation services sector. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated October 5, 2016, Sajan engaged Dougherty
to act as its financial advisor in connection with a possible sale. The engagement letter between Sajan and Dougherty provides for a
transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of April 25, 2017, to be approximately $475,000.
Approximately $50,000 of this amount became payable upon delivery of the fairness opinion and approximately $425,000 of this
amount is contingent upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In addition, Sajan has
agreed to reimburse Dougherty for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify
Dougherty and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Financing of the Merger

Amplexor’s and Merger Sub’s obligations under the Merger Agreement are not subject to any financing condition. The parent
company of Amplexor, Amplexor International S.A., has guaranteed the obligations of Amplexor under the Merger Agreement.

Interests of Sajan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of the Special Committee and the Board that you vote for the proposal to approve the
Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that certain of our directors and executive officers may have
interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. The Special Committee and the
Board was aware of these interests in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and in recommending that the Merger and
the Merger Agreement be approved and adopted by our stockholders.

For purposes of this proxy statement, our named executive officers for fiscal 2016 consist of Shannon Zimmerman, Thomas P.
Skiba and Paul Rome, although Mr. Rome’s employment with Sajan terminated on November 9, 2016. The compensation that may
become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger is subject to approval, on a non-binding and
advisory basis, by our stockholders, as described below in the section entitled “Proposal No. 2 — Approval, on an Advisory Basis,
of Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation.”

Treatment of Option Awards

Under the Merger Agreement, the options held by our directors and executive officers under our equity plans will be treated as
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Sajan Option Awards.”

The following table sets forth the number of shares underlying stock options, whether vested or unvested, held by our non-
employee directors and executive officers as of June 12, 2017 and the amount of Merger Consideration that will be payable in
connection therewith upon settlement of the outstanding options as of the Effective Time of the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Employment Agreements

We have entered into employment agreements with each of our named executive officers. Under the employment agreement
between Shannon Zimmerman and Sajan, dated May 19, 2006, as amended February 1, 2010 and January 5, 2017, we are required
to pay severance in an amount equal to Mr. Zimmerman’s then-current annual salary upon termination of employment by us other
than for cause or upon termination of employment by Mr. Zimmerman for our uncured breach of any material provision of his
employment agreement, and requires us to pay for one year of health insurance coverage, not to exceed $5,000 for the annual
period. Cause is defined as (i) a material act of dishonesty made by Mr. Zimmerman in connection with his responsibilities as an
employee, (ii) Mr. Zimmerman’s commission of a felony, (iii) Mr. Zimmerman’s gross misconduct, (iv) Mr. Zimmerman’s
continued substantial violations of his employment duties after he has received a written demand for performance from us that
specifically sets forth the factual basis for our belief that he has not substantially performed his duties or (v) Mr. Zimmerman’s
continued material breach of his employment agreement or any confidentiality or proprietary information agreement between Mr.
Zimmerman and us after he has received a written notice that specifically sets forth the factual basis for our belief that he has
breached his employment agreement or any confidentiality or proprietary information agreement between him and us.

Mr. Zimmerman is expected to enter into a new employment agreement with the Surviving Corporation in connection with
closing of the Merger. He is expected to receive an annual base salary of $210,000, which is consistent with his current annual base
salary, and bonus opportunities consistent with Sajan’s current bonus plan. He will also be eligible for severance consistent with his
current agreement, including twelve months of continued base salary and continued payment of health insurance premiums for the
same amount of time. Mr. Zimmerman will be subject to six-month non-compete and non-solicitation provisions.

Under the employment agreement dated August 20, 2013, as amended March 9, 2015 and January 5, 2017, between Thomas
Skiba and Sajan, all unvested stock options will become vested upon a change of control (which includes the Merger). The
employment agreement may be terminated by either party upon three months’ written notice. In the event we terminate Mr. Skiba’s
employment for any reason not constituting cause or Mr. Skiba terminates his employment for good reason, we will pay his base
salary through the date of termination and will provide the following benefits: (i) severance pay equal to twelve months of his
ending base salary, (ii) one year of health insurance coverage, not to exceed $5,000 for the annual period, and (iii) immediate
vesting of all stock options that are due to be vested within twelve months from the date of termination.

Cause is defined as (i) theft, embezzlement, or a material act of dishonesty by Mr. Skiba, (ii) Mr. Skiba’s commission of a
felony or crime of moral turpitude, (iii) Mr. Skiba’s gross misconduct, (iv) Mr. Skiba’s continued substantial failure to satisfy his
employment duties after he has received a written demand for performance from us that specifically sets forth the factual basis for
our belief that he has not substantially performed his duties and he has failed to cure his substantial failure to satisfy his
employment duties to the satisfaction of our Chief Executive Officer within 30 days of his receipt of such written demand; (v) Mr.
Skiba’s continued material breach of his employment agreement or any material policy of ours after he has received a written notice
that specifically sets forth the factual basis for our belief that he has breached his employment agreement or any material policy of
ours; or (vi) his breach of his restrictive covenant agreement or any subsequent confidentiality and/or proprietary information
agreements between him and us. Good reason includes either of the following events occurring without Mr. Skiba’s advance
consent provided that we have not cured such event within 30 days after receiving written notice from Mr. Skiba of such event: (a)
continued failure by us to comply with any material provision of his employment agreement; or (b) a material diminution in his
responsibilities, authority or base salary.

Mr. Skiba also holds options to purchase shares of our Common Stock, which were granted pursuant to our 2004 Amended and
Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan and our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. Pursuant to these plans and the forms of option agreement
used for grants under these plans, all outstanding unvested stock options will vest and become exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger. Mr. Zimmerman does not hold any stock options.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Sajan’s Named Executive Officers

The table below shows the estimated compensation that each named executive officer would receive assuming that the Merger
was consummated and each named executive officer’s employment was terminated by Sajan without cause or by the named
executive officer for good reason on June 12, 2017.

The amounts reflected in the table and the footnotes are determined using a per-share price for our Common Stock of $5.83,
which is equal to the Merger Consideration. The compensation summarized in the table and footnotes below for each named
executive officer is subject to approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, by our stockholders, as described below in the section
entitled “Proposal No. 2 — Approval, on an Advisory Basis, of Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation.”

The tables below do not include amounts the named executive officers were already entitled to receive or that were vested as of
June 12, 2017, or amounts under contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements to the extent they do not discriminate in scope, terms
or operation in favor of a named executive officer and that are available generally to all of our salaried employees. The estimated
amounts below are based on multiple assumptions that may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this Proxy
Statement. In addition, certain amounts will vary depending on the actual date of closing of the Merger, which is presently expected
to occur in the third quarter of 2017. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by an applicable individual may differ in
material respects from the amounts set forth below.

employment by us without cause or by the named executive officer for good reason.

(2) This amount represents the aggregate Merger Consideration with respect to shares subject to unvested stock options that will
become vested and will convert into the right to receive cash upon the closing of the Merger, as described in the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Sajan Option Awards.” The amounts are determined as of June 12, 2017 and some of
the outstanding unvested stock options are scheduled to vest before the closing date. Any such unvested stock options that vest
before the closing date will no longer be counted as golden parachute payments at closing, but are included in the calculations
here.

(3) This amount represents one year of Company-sponsored health insurance coverage, not to exceed $5,000 for the annual period.

(4) Mr. Rome’s employment with Sajan terminated on November 9, 2016 and he is not eligible to receive any compensation in
connection with the Merger.

Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers

For six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Amplexor and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of our and our subsidiaries’ officers or directors against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions in their
capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement), and shall reimburse each of our and our subsidiaries’ officers or directors for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,
expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses are incurred, subject to the Surviving Corporation’s receipt of an undertaking by
such person to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable law;
provided, however, that the Surviving

Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporation’s prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Additionally, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification than are set forth in the our
current certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner than would adversely in any manner affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were our or our subsidiaries’ directors or officers.

Amplexor and Merger Sub have also agreed that, all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by us
now existing in favor of each of our and our subsidiaries’ officers or directors as provided in our certificate of incorporation and by-
laws, in each case as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, or pursuant to any other contracts in effect on the date of the
Merger Agreement, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and
shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any
proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final disposition of such proceeding or claim.

Amplexor also agreed to cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) maintain in effect for a period of six years after the Effective
Time, if available, the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by us immediately prior to the
Effective Time (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies, of at least the same coverage and amounts
and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries
when compared to the insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof), or (ii) obtain as of the Effective Time “tail”
insurance policies with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to our and our subsidiaries’ directors and officers, in each case with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement). However, that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid by us for
such insurance prior to the date of the Merger Agreement. If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium
equal to or less than such amount, Amplexor agreed to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain that amount of directors’ and
officers’ insurance (or “tail” coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to such amount.

Amplexor and the Surviving Corporation are required to make proper provision for the continuation of these rights in
connection with certain future corporate transactions.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders (as
defined below) of our Common Stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion does not
address U.S. federal income tax consequences with respect to holders other than U.S. Holders. This discussion is based on the
provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial
opinions and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “ IRS”), each as in effect as of the
date hereof. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change
or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion is for
general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences. This discussion
does not address any tax consequences arising under the 3.8% Medicare Net Investment Income Tax imposed by Section 1411 of
the Code, nor does it address any tax considerations under state, local or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than those
pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax. This discussion is not binding on the IRS or the courts and, therefore, could be subject to
challenge, which could be sustained. No ruling will be sought from the IRS with respect to the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of our Common Stock that is for U.S. federal
income tax purposes:

• a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

• a corporation, or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;

• a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration, and one
or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) such trust has a valid election in
effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

This discussion applies only to U.S. Holders of shares of our Common Stock who hold such shares as a capital asset within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to consider
all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a U.S. Holder in light of its particular circumstances, or that may
apply to U.S. Holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, insurance
companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of
accounting, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, U.S. Holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar,
tax-exempt organizations, tax-qualified retirement plans, banks and other financial institutions, mutual funds, certain expatriates, S
corporations, or other pass-through entities, or investors in such S corporations or other pass-through entities, real estate investment
trusts, regulated investment companies, U.S. Holders who hold shares of our Common Stock as part of a hedge, straddle,
constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction, U.S. Holders who will hold (actually or constructively) an equity
interest in Amplexor immediately after the Merger, and U.S. Holders who acquired their shares of our Common Stock through the
exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements).

If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) holds shares of our Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status
of the partners and the activities of the partnership. If you are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a partner in a partnership
holding shares of our Common Stock, you should consult your tax advisor.

This summary of U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice.
Holders of our Common Stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to
them of the Merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare Net Investment
Income Tax and any other U.S. federal, or state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

The receipt of cash by U.S. Holders in exchange for shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder who receives cash
in exchange for shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received and (2) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.

Any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. Holder’s holding period in the shares of our Common
Stock surrendered in the Merger is greater than one year as of the date of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-
corporate holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of
capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of our Common Stock at different times and
different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to
each block of our Common Stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Payments made in exchange for shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject, under certain
circumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%). To avoid backup withholding, a U.S.
Holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return to the applicable withholding agent a properly
completed and executed IRS Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. Holder is a U.S. person, that the taxpayer identification number
provided is correct and that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or
credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to
the IRS in a timely manner.

Regulatory Approvals

The Merger is not subject to any required regulatory approvals.

Delisting and Deregistration of Sajan Common Stock

If the Merger is completed, our Common Stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Vote Required and Board Recommendation

We are asking you to approve a proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement. For a detailed discussion of
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the Merger
Agreement is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex A.

Assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of our shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of
business on the record date for the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal is required to approve the proposal
approving the Merger and adopting the Merger Agreement.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER
AND THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this document
as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference into this document. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not
contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the Merger

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

The following summary of the Merger Agreement, and the copy of the Merger Agreement attached as Annex A to this
document, are intended to provide information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and are not intended to provide any
factual information about Sajan or modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Sajan in its public reports filed with the

disclosures regarding any facts and circumstances relating to Sajan. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties
by and covenants of Sajan, Amplexor, and Merger Sub that were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specified
dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the
Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential
disclosures and being made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of
establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality or material adverse effect applicable
to the contracting parties that generally differ from those applicable to investors. In addition, information concerning the subject
matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent
information may or may not be fully reflected in Sajan’s public disclosures. The representations, warranties and covenants in the
Merger Agreement and any descriptions thereof should be read in conjunction with the disclosures in Sajan’s periodic and current
reports, proxy statements and other documents filed with the SEC. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional
Information.” Moreover, the description of the Merger Agreement below does not purport to describe all of the terms of such
agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as
Annex A and is incorporated herein by reference.

Additional information about Sajan may be found elsewhere in this document and in Sajan’s other public filings. See the
section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

Structure of the Merger; Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers

At the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into Sajan, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will
cease. Sajan will be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and will continue its corporate existence as a Delaware corporation
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amplexor.

At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Sajan will be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the
form attached as Exhibit C to the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Annex A hereto, and such certificate will be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. Also at the Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub will become the
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

At the Effective Time, the individuals holding positions as directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately before the
Effective Time will become the initial directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation.

When the Merger Becomes Effective

The closing of the Merger will take place at 10:00 a.m. Chicago Time at the offices of Quarles & Brady LLP, 300 North LaSalle
Street, Chicago, Illinois 60654, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within three business days) after the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted by the Merger Agreement, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
hereunder, waiver of all such conditions).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

At the closing, the certificate of merger will be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger will
become effective at the time when the certificate of merger are filed or at such later date or time as may be agreed by Sajan and
Amplexor and specified in the certificate of merger.

Effect of the Merger on the Common Stock

At the Effective Time, each share of our Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Treasury Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Merger
Consideration will be $5.83 per share in cash, without interest, and subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

At the Effective Time, each Dissenting Share will be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL;
provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such
holder’s right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Common Stock shall be treated as if they
had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. For more information regarding
appraisal rights, see the section entitled “Appraisal Rights.”

At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and such shares will
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Treatment of Sajan Option Awards

At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Common Stock that is outstanding, whether vested or unvested, shall
immediately accelerate and vest and become exercisable and will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (a) the aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock subject to such stock option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (b) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise
price of such stock option, less any taxes required to be withheld.

Payment for Common Stock in the Merger

On or after the Effective Time, Amplexor will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent reasonably acceptable
to Sajan sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time, Amplexor shall send, or
shall cause the exchange agent to send, to each record holder of shares of Common Stock at the Effective Time, a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the stock certificates or transfer of book-entry shares to the exchange agent) for use in such exchange. Upon (i)
surrender of certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu of certificates and, if required, the posting of a bond) to the exchange
agent together with the letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions to the letter of
transmittal or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the exchange agent (or such other evidence as the exchange agent may
reasonably request), the holder of such certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu of certificates) or book-entry shares will be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for all such shares of Common Stock.

with respect to any joint venture, strategic partnership or alliance, other than reseller agreements entered into in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice;

• except in connection with actions permitted by the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, take any action to
exempt any person from, or make any acquisition of our securities by any person not subject to, any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation that applies to us with respect to a Takeover Proposal or otherwise, including the restrictions on

No Solicitation; Takeover Proposals

We and our Board will generally not be permitted to solicit or participate in discussions regarding any inquiry, indication of
interest or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal. For purposes of the Merger Agreement:

• “Takeover Proposal” means a proposal or offer from, or indication of interest in making a proposal or offer by, any person
(other than Amplexor and its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub) relating to any (a) direct or indirect acquisition of our or
our subsidiaries’ assets (including any voting equity interests of our subsidiaries, but excluding sales of assets in the
ordinary course of business) equal to fifteen percent (15%) or more of the fair market value of our consolidated assets or to
which fifteen percent (15%) or more of our net revenues or net income on a consolidated basis are attributable, (b) direct or
indirect acquisition of fifteen percent (15%) or more of our voting equity interests, (c) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
fifteen percent (15%) or more of our voting equity interests, (d) merger, consolidation, other business combination or
similar transaction involving us or any of our subsidiaries, pursuant to which such person would own fifteen percent (15%)
or more of our consolidated assets, net revenues or net income, taken as a whole, or (e) our liquidation or dissolution (or the
adoption of a plan of liquidation or dissolution) or our declaration or payment of an extraordinary dividend (whether in cash
or other property).

• “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Takeover Proposal involving the direct or indirect acquisition pursuant to a
tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, of all or substantially all of our
consolidated assets or a majority of our outstanding Common Stock, that our Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and Dougherty) is more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of
our Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, taking into account (a) all financial
considerations, (b) the identity of the third party making such Takeover Proposal, (c) the anticipated timing, conditions
(including any financing condition or the reliability of any debt or equity funding commitments) and prospects for
completion of such Takeover Proposal, (d) the other terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and the implications
thereof on us, including relevant legal, regulatory and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal deemed relevant by the
Board and (e) any revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Merger proposed by Amplexor.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Except as permitted by the Merger Agreement, prior to closing of the Merger, the Merger Agreement requires that we will not,
and will cause our subsidiaries not to, and will not authorize or give permission to our or our subsidiaries’ directors, officers,
employees, advisors and investment banks to, directly or indirectly

• solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any Takeover Proposal or the
making of any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal;

• conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-public information relating to us or any of our
subsidiaries to, afford access to our or our subsidiaries’ business, properties, assets, books or records to, or knowingly
assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, any Takeover
Proposal;

• amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of our or our
subsidiaries’ equity securities;

• approve any transaction under, or any third party becoming an “interested stockholder” under, Section 203 of the DGCL; or

• enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other contract relating to any Takeover Proposal.

Notwithstanding these no-shop restrictions, prior to the time the requisite stockholder vote is obtained, the Board, directly or
indirectly through any of its representatives, may, participate in negotiations or discussions with any third party that has made (and
not withdrawn) a bona fide, unsolicited Takeover Proposal orally or in writing that the Board believes in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and Dougherty, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
and thereafter furnish to such third party non-public information relating to us or our subsidiaries pursuant to an executed
confidentiality agreement that contains confidentiality and standstill provisions that are no less favorable to us than those contained
in the confidentiality agreement with Amplexor, provided that the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to cause the Board to be in breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Prior to closing of the Merger, we are also required to notify Amplexor promptly (but in no event later than forty-eight hours)
(A) after we obtain knowledge of our receipt, or the receipt by any of our representatives, of any Takeover Proposal, any inquiry
that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, any request for non-public information relating us or any of our
subsidiaries or for access to our or our subsidiaries’ business, properties, assets, books or records by any third party; (B) of the
status and material terms of any such Takeover Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or proposed
amendments as to price and other material terms thereof; and (C) prior to any meeting of the Board (or such lesser notice as is
provided to the members of the Board) at which the Board is reasonably expected to consider any Takeover Proposal. We are also
required to promptly provide Amplexor with a list of any non-public information concerning our business, present or future
performance, financial condition or results of operations, provided to any third party, and, to the extent such information has not
been previously provided to Amplexor, copies of such information.

Change in Board Recommendation

As described in the section entitled “Proposal No. 1 — The Merger — Reasons for the Special Committee’s and our Board’s
Recommendation in Favor of the Merger,” and subject to the provisions described below, our Board has unanimously
recommended that our stockholders vote FOR the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger
Agreement provides that, except as described below, our Board may not:

• fail to make, withdraw, amend, modify or materially qualify, in a manner adverse to Amplexor or Merger Sub, our Board’s
recommendation in favor of the Merger;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• recommend a Takeover Proposal, fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the shares
of Common Stock within ten business days after the commencement of such offer, or make any public statement
inconsistent with our Board’s recommendation in favor of the Merger;

• resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions.

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above and in the section entitled “— No Solicitation; Takeover Proposals,” at any
time prior to the time the requisite stockholder vote is obtained, our Board may, in response to an intervening event or a Superior
Proposal, change its recommendation in favor of the Merger and/or enter into a definitive agreement regarding a Superior Proposal.
Our Board is permitted to take these actions only if:

• our Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to cause the Board to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law;

• we have notified Amplexor, in writing, at least five business days before making a change to our Board’s recommendation
in favor of the Merger or entering into a definitive agreement regarding a Superior Proposal of our intention to take such
action with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that we have received a Takeover Proposal that
our Board intends to declare a Superior Proposal and that our Board intends to change its recommendation in favor of the
Merger and/or we intend to enter into a definitive agreement regarding a Superior Proposal;

• we have provided the material terms of the proposed definitive agreement regarding the Superior Proposal;

• we have, and have caused our subsidiaries to, and have used our reasonable best efforts to cause our and our subsidiaries’
representatives to, negotiate with Amplexor in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Amplexor, in its discretion,
proposes to make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the Amplexor will have additional three business day periods to
negotiate any adjustments after we notify Amplexor of any material revisions to the proposed definitive agreement); and

• our Board has determined in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and Dougherty, that such Takeover
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Amplexor.

Nothing contained in the Merger Agreement prohibits our Board from disclosing to our stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Takeover Proposal, if we determine, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such position would constitute a violation of applicable law.

Sajan Stockholders’ Meeting

Subject to the relevant provisions of the Merger Agreement, including our Board’s right to change its recommendation in favor
of the Merger and our right to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal, as described in the section entitled “— Change in Board Recommendation,” we agreed to take all action necessary to
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger
Agreement. We also agreed to use reasonable best efforts to solicit from the holders of Common Stock proxies in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote
or consent of the holders of Common Stock required by applicable law to obtain such approval. Once the Special Meeting has been
called and noticed, we shall not postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting without the consent of Amplexor (other than in order to
obtain a quorum of our stockholders or as we reasonably determine to comply with applicable law).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Employee Matters

The Merger Agreement provides for the following treatment with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ employees who continue
to be employed by the Surviving Corporation or one of its subsidiaries after the Effective Time (the “Continuing Employees”):

• for 12 months following the Effective Time, Amplexor will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the Continuing
Employees with base salary, target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation), and employee benefits that
are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the base salary, target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation), and employee benefits provided by us and our subsidiaries on the date of the Merger Agreement; and

• with respect to any Amplexor employee benefit plan (excluding retiree healthcare plans and any equity compensation plans)
in which any Continuing Employee will participate as of the Effective Time, Amplexor will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, recognize all service of the Continuing Employees with us or our subsidiaries as if the service were with
Amplexor for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for purposes of early retirement subsidies under any defined benefit
pension plan or for benefit accrual purposes, except for vacation), provided that such service will not be recognized if it
would result in the duplication or benefits or such service would not have been recognized under our comparable employee
benefit plan prior to the Effective Time.

Indemnification and Insurance

For six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Amplexor and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of our and our subsidiaries’ officers or directors against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions in their
capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement), and shall reimburse each of our and our subsidiaries’ officers or directors for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,
expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses are incurred, subject to the Surviving Corporation’s receipt of an undertaking by
such person to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable law;
provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving
Corporation’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Additionally, the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and
indemnification than are set forth in the our current certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner than would adversely in
any manner affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were our or our subsidiaries’ directors
or officers.

Amplexor and Merger Sub have also agreed that, all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by us
now existing in favor of each of our and our subsidiaries’ officers or directors as provided in our certificate of incorporation and by-
laws, in each case as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, or pursuant to any other contracts in effect on the date of the
Merger Agreement, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and
shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any
proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final disposition of such proceeding or claim.

Amplexor also agreed to cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) maintain in effect for a period of six years after the Effective
Time, if available, the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by us immediately prior to the
Effective Time (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies, of at least the same coverage and amounts
and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries
when compared to the insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof), or (ii) obtain as of the Effective Time “tail”
insurance policies with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time with at least the

same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to our and our subsidiaries’
directors and officers, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the
Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement). However, that in no event
will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the last annual premium paid by us for such insurance prior to the date of the Merger Agreement. If such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than such amount, Amplexor agreed to cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain that amount of directors’ and officers’ insurance (or “tail” coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal
to such amount.

Amplexor and the Surviving Corporation are required to make proper provision for the continuation of these rights in
connection with certain future corporate transactions.

Other Covenants and Agreements

The Merger Agreement also contains additional covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to confidentiality,
preparation and filing of this Proxy Statement, providing notice of certain events, including litigation related to the Merger
Agreement, public announcements relating to the Merger, elimination of any applicable takeover statutes, exemptions of
dispositions of Sajan securities in connection with the Merger under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, and Amplexor International
S.A. providing a guaranty of Amplexor and Merger Sub’s obligations under the Merger Agreement.

such time (except those representations and warranties that address matters only as of a particular date, which shall be true

correct would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on us;

• our representations and warranties related to capitalization being true and correct when made and as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, as if made at and as of such time (except those representations and warranties that address matters only
as of a particular date, which shall be true and correct in all material respects as of that date), except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not reasonably be expected to result in an increase in the

• by mutual written consent of Sajan, Merger Sub and Amplexor;

• by either Sajan or Amplexor, if:

conditions in the Merger Agreement. Any waiver must be set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the applicable party.

PROPOSAL NO. 2
APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER

MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, we are providing our
stockholders with a separate non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to
our named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as described in the table entitled “Golden Parachute Compensation”
under “Proposal No. 1 — The Merger — Interests of Sajan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Quantification of
Payments and Benefits to Sajan’s Named Executive Officers ,” including the footnotes to the table and related narrative discussion.

The Board unanimously recommends that our stockholders approve the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Sajan’s named executive officers in connection with
the Merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in each
case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the table in the section entitled “Proposal No. 1 — The
Merger — Interests of Sajan’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Sajan’s
Named Executive Officers,” including the footnotes to the table and the related narrative discussion, is hereby approved, on a non-
binding and advisory basis.”

The vote on the named executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the
proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger and adopt the
Merger Agreement and vote not to approve the named executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa.
Because the vote on the named executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal is non-binding and advisory only, it will
not be binding on either Sajan or Amplexor. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is approved and the Merger is completed, the
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto under the applicable compensation agreements and
arrangements, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of our stockholders.

Assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock represented at the Special
Meeting, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote is required to approve the above resolution approving the Merger-related
compensation of our named executive officers on a non-binding, advisory basis.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE
MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

PROPOSAL NO. 3
APPROVAL OF ADJOURNMENT

Our stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give the Board authority to adjourn the Special Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger
Agreement, if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the proposal to approve the Merger and
adopt the Merger Agreement or in the absence of a quorum. If this adjournment proposal is approved, the Special Meeting could be
adjourned by the Board to any date. In addition, the Board could postpone the Special Meeting before it commences. If the Special
Meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be
able to revoke them at any time before the final vote.

We do not anticipate calling a vote on this proposal if a quorum is present and the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the
Merger Agreement is approved by at least a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding as of the record date.

The vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to approve the Merger and
adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the proposal to approve the Merger and adopt the Merger
Agreement and vote not to approve the adjournment proposal and vice versa.

Assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock represented at the Special
Meeting, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote is required to approve the adjournment proposal.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE
ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKET PRICE OF SAJAN COMMON STOCK

Our Common Stock is traded on NASDAQ under the symbol “SAJA”. The last reported sales price for our Common Stock on
April 25, 2017, the last trading day before the Merger was publicly announced, was $3.99 per share. On June 12, 2017, the most
recent practicable date before the filing of this document, the last reported sales price for our Common Stock was $5.77 per share.

The following table shows the high and low per-share sale prices for our Common Stock for the 2016 and 2015 fiscal quarters
and for the 2017 fiscal quarters to-date.

  
 High  Low

2015           
First Quarter  $ 6.40  $ 5.21 
Second Quarter  $ 6.26  $ 4.80 
Third Quarter  $ 6.56  $ 4.80 
Fourth Quarter  $ 5.04  $ 3.34 
2016           
First Quarter  $ 3.95  $ 2.45

Second Quarter (through June 12, 2017)  $ 6.51*  $ 3.24 

* Reflects sale on April 26, 2017; the closing price on April 26, 2017 was $5.70.

Holders of our Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividends as are declared by our Board out of funds legally available
for the payment of dividends. We presently intend to retain any earnings to fund the development of our business and the agreement
governing our credit facility restricts our ability to pay dividends. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our
Common Stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to declaration and payment of dividends will be made at the
discretion of our Board.

If the Merger is consummated, our Common Stock will be delisted from NASDAQ, there will be no further public market for
shares of our Common Stock and each share of our Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive $5.83 in cash,
without interest, less any required withholding taxes.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

Holders of shares of Sajan Common Stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly
demand appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is
qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex C.
The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice nor does it constitute a recommendation that
stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, subject to the terms and conditions of Section 262 of the DGCL including Section 262(g) of
the DGCL described below, holders of shares of Sajan Common Stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and who otherwise follow the requirements of and procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to
have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Court of Chancery”) and to receive payment in
cash of the “fair value” of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger, as determined by the Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair
value.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a Merger Agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to
appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This Proxy
Statement constitutes that notice, and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex
C. Any holder of Sajan Common Stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do
so, should review the following discussion and Annex C carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the
procedures specified will result in the loss of appraisal rights. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising
the right to seek appraisal of shares of Common Stock, Sajan believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, such
stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

Filing Written Demand.  Any holder of Sajan Common Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Sajan, before
the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement will
be submitted to the Sajan stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares. A holder of shares of Sajan
Common Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is
made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective date of the Merger, since appraisal rights will be lost if
the shares are transferred prior to the effective date of the Merger. The holder must not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any
previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or abstain from
voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, nor abstaining
from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, will in and of itself constitute a written demand for
appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. The demand must reasonably inform Sajan of the
identity of the holder as well as the intention of the holder to demand an appraisal of the “fair value” of the shares held by the
holder. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement
at the Special Meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

Only a holder of record of shares of Sajan Common Stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that
holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Sajan Common Stock should be executed by or on behalf of the
holder of record, fully and correctly, as the holder’s name appears on the holder’s stock certificates, should specify the holder’s
name and mailing address and the number of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

shares registered in the holder’s name and must state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder’s shares in
connection with the Merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian,
execution of the demand should be made in that capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a
joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent,
including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the
agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent
for the record owner or owners. If the shares are held in “street name” by a broker, bank or nominee, the broker, bank or nominee
may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising the rights with
respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners; in such case, however, the written demand should set forth the number of
shares as to which appraisal is sought and where no number of shares is expressly mentioned the demand will be presumed to cover
all shares of Sajan Common Stock held in the name of the record owner. Stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts
or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers to determine the
appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be sent or delivered to: Sajan, Inc., 625
Whitetail Boulevard, River Falls, Wisconsin 54022, Attn: Corporate Secretary

At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined
that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the Merger Consideration by
delivering to Sajan, as the Surviving Corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. Any such attempt to withdraw
the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of Sajan. No appraisal proceeding in the
Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court of Chancery, and such approval may
be conditioned upon such terms as the Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal
and accept the Merger Consideration within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger. Any stockholder who withdraws his, her
or its demand will be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Merger Agreement, which are summarized in this Proxy Statement
and is attached in its entirety as Annex A. If the Surviving Corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for
appraisal when that approval is required, or if the Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding, the
stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be
less than, equal to or more than the consideration being offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation.  Within ten days after the Effective Time, Sajan, as the Surviving Corporation must notify
each former holder of Sajan Common Stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, of the date on which the Merger became effective.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal.  Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, the Surviving Corporation or any
holder of Sajan Common Stock who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination
of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting holders. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to and has no present
intention to file a petition and holders should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any
negotiations with respect to the fair value of the dissenting holders’ shares. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the former holders of
Sajan Common Stock to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of Sajan Common Stock
within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of Sajan Common
Stock who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from
the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such
shares. The statement must be mailed within ten days after a written

TABLE OF CONTENTS

request therefor has been received by the Surviving Corporation or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of
demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Sajan
Common Stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a
petition or request from Sajan the statement described in this paragraph.

If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a holder of shares of Sajan Common Stock and a copy thereof is served upon the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days to file with the Delaware Register in
Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required
by the court, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have
complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of Chancery may
require the stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceeding; and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of
Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to the stockholder. Notwithstanding a stockholder’s compliance with the foregoing
requirements, Section 262(g) of the DGCL provides that, because immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger Sajan
Common Stock will be listed on a national securities exchange, the Court of Chancery will dismiss the proceedings as to all holders
of Sajan Common Stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal
exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the
Merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.

Determination of Fair Value.  After the Court of Chancery determines the former holders of Sajan Common Stock entitled to
appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules
specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Court of Chancery shall determine the “fair value” of
the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest,
if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines
otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be
compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from
time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment.

In determining fair value, the Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding,
stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and
otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors
involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court
must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be
ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the
DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that]
does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including
the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation,
may be considered.”

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined could be less
than, the same as or more than the Merger Consideration and that an investment banking opinion as to fairness from a financial
point of view is not an opinion as to fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Although Sajan believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of
fair value as determined by the Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a
determination of a value lower or higher than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither Amplexor nor Sajan anticipate
offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder of Sajan exercising appraisal rights, and reserve the right to assert,
in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of Sajan Common Stock is
less than the Merger Consideration.

If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the action may be determined
by the Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in
connection with an appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of
experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.

If any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares of Sajan Common Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect,
successfully withdraws or loses such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of Sajan Common Stock will be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or
effectively lose, the holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time.

THE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES STRICT COMPLIANCE
WITH TECHNICAL PREREQUISITES. FAILURE TO COMPLY STRICTLY WITH ALL OF THE PROCEDURES SET
FORTH IN SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF A STOCKHOLDER’S STATUTORY
APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH
YOUR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ANY INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE
FOREGOING SUMMARY AND SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, THE DGCL WILL GOVERN.

MULTIPLE STOCKHOLDERS SHARING ONE ADDRESS

In accordance with Rule 14a-3(e)(1) under the Exchange Act, one Proxy Statement will be delivered to two or more
shareholders who share an address, unless Sajan has received contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders. Each
stockholder will receive a separate proxy card. Sajan will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the Proxy
Statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the Proxy Statement was delivered. Requests for additional
copies of the Proxy Statement should be directed to Sajan in care of the Secretary at 625 Whitetail Boulevard, River Falls,
Wisconsin 54022, Attn: Secretary, or by calling (715) 426-9505. In addition, stockholders who share a single address, but receive

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

Depending on if and when the Merger is completed, we may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2017. If the Merger
is completed, we will not hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2018. If the Merger is not completed, you will continue to be
entitled to attend and participate in our annual meetings of stockholders. If any such annual meeting is held, stockholder proposals
will be eligible for consideration for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy for such annual meeting of stockholders in
accordance with Rules 14a-4 and 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

Since the date of the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, if held, will be more than 30 days after the anniversary date of the
2016 annual meeting of shareholders, the deadline for inclusion of proposals in our proxy statement for the 2017 annual meeting
will be a reasonable time before we begin to print and mail our proxy materials, assuming a 2017 annual meeting is held.

Rule 14a-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the Company’s use of its discretionary proxy
voting authority with respect to a stockholder proposal that the stockholder has not sought to include in the Company’s proxy
statement. Rule 14a-4 provides that if a proponent of a proposal fails to notify the Company at least 45 days prior to the month and
day of mailing of the prior year’s proxy statement, management proxies will be allowed to use their discretionary voting authority
when the proposal is raised at the meeting, without any discussion of the matter.

Since the date of the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, if held, will be more than 30 days after the anniversary date of the
2016 annual meeting of shareholders, the deadline for providing notice of proposals to be presented at the 2017 annual meeting but
not included in the Company’s proxy statement for the 2017 annual meeting will be a reasonable time before we begin to print and
mail our proxy materials, assuming a 2017 annual meeting is held.

Section 2.01 Conversion of Shares of Common Stock.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company:

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock that is held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution will be made with respect thereto.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled and retired in accordance with Section 2.01(a), and (ii) Dissenting Shares) will
be converted into the right to receive $5.83 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).

(c) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding, will be cancelled and retired,
and will cease to exist, and, subject to Section 2.03, each holder of a certificate formerly representing any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02 hereof.

(d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.02 Surrender and Payment.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange
Agent”) to act as the agent for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration for: (i) the Certificates, or (ii) book-entry
shares which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented the shares of Company Common Stock (the “Book-Entry
Shares”). On and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Exchange
Agent, sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by the Certificates and the Book-Entry Shares (the “Payment Fund”) in amounts and at the times
necessary for such payments. If for any reason the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of
Company Common Stock shall be entitled under Section 2.01(b), Buyer shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the
Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to make all payments
required under this Agreement, and Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for the payment thereof. The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including
those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration.
Promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of shares of
Company Common Stock at the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to
the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange
Agent, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, and
subject to the terms set forth in Section 2.03, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of any

Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, each
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly
transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article II.

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Buyer, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.02 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Buyer for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock two (2) years after the Effective
Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Buyer free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be
returned to Buyer, upon demand.

Section 2.03 Dissenting Shares.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, including Section 2.01,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares cancelled
and retired in accordance with Section 2.01(a)) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (such shares of Company Common Stock being referred to collectively as the “Dissenting Shares” until such time as such
holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder’s appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock) shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such
rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or loses such holder’s right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common
Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.01(b), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share of
Company Common Stock or transfer of such Book-Entry Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Buyer prompt
written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of
any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the
DGCL that relates to such demand, and Buyer shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Buyer, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

Section 2.04 Adjustments.  Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall
occur (other than the issuance of additional shares of capital stock of the Company as permitted by this Agreement), including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

Section 2.05 Withholding Rights.  Each of the Exchange Agent, Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article II such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, and applicable Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto (the “Code”), or any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Exchange Agent, Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

Section 2.06 Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Buyer, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Buyer may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated under this Article II.

Section 2.07 Treatment of Stock Options.

(a) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a “Company Stock Option”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
then vested or exercisable, shall immediately accelerate and vest and become exercisable and shall be, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of that Company Stock Option or any other Person,
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Buyer and the Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the later of fifteen (15) calendar days following the Closing and the first
Business Day on which the Surviving Corporation pays payroll following the Closing), an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied
by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option, less any
Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section 2.05.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company
Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions (including obtaining any employee consents) that may be
necessary to effectuate the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section 2.07.

Effect.

Documents that it has so filed or furnished prior to the date hereof. As of their respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded
by a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date hereof), each of the
Company SEC Documents complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to
such Company SEC Documents. None of the Company SEC Documents, including any financial statements, schedules or exhibits
included or incorporated by reference therein at the time they were filed (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of
the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date hereof), contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the Company’s Subsidiaries is required to file or furnish any
forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.

(b) Financial Statements.  Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto)
contained in the Company SEC Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto as of their respective dates; (ii) was prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted

(c) Internal Controls.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has established and maintains a system of “internal control
over financial reporting” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that is sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance (i) regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and the Company Board, and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s
financial statements.

(d) Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  The Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make
the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures
prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company’s auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board and on Section
3.04(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that could adversely affect in any material respect the Company’s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. For purposes of this Agreement,
the terms “significant deficiency” and “material weakness” shall have the meaning assigned to them in Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard 2, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(e) Undisclosed Liabilities.  The audited balance sheet of the Company dated as of December 31, 2016 contained in the

(f) Off-balance Sheet Arrangements.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to
become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or
any “off balance sheet arrangements” (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the Company’s or such Subsidiary’s published financial statements or other Company SEC
Documents.

(g) Sarbanes-Oxley Compliance.  Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Company

2002 (including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) with respect to the Company SEC
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate in all material respects. For purposes of this
Agreement, “principal executive officer” and “principal financial officer” shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding (nor has arranged or modified since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any “extensions of credit” (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to
directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company is otherwise in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules of Nasdaq, except for any non-compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the business of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has been conducted in the ordinary course of business and there has not been or occurred:

(a) any Company Material Adverse Effect or any event, condition, change or effect that could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

(b) any event, condition, action or effect that, if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time, would constitute a breach of Section 5.01.

Section 3.06 Taxes.

(a) Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have duly and timely filed or caused to be
filed (taking into account any valid extensions) all material Tax Returns required to be filed by them. Such Tax Returns are true,
complete and correct in all material respects. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return other than extensions of time to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary

such access or disclosure would jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law (it being agreed that
the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such
jeopardy or contravention). No investigation shall affect the Company’s representations and warranties contained herein, or limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available to Buyer or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) Buyer and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their
respective obligations under the Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement dated February 3, 2016 between Buyer and the

set forth therein.

Section 5.04 No Solicitation.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or give permission to its and its
Subsidiaries’ directors, officers, employees, advisors and investment bankers (with respect to any Person, the foregoing Persons are
referred to herein as such Person’s “Representatives”) to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to
facilitate or encourage the submission of any Takeover Proposal or the making of any proposal that could reasonably be expected to
lead to any Takeover Proposal, or, subject to Section 5.04(b), (i) conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with,
disclose any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, afford access to the business, properties,

foregoing, a “Company Adverse Recommendation Change”). The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to cease
immediately and cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its or their Representatives to continue,
any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party conducted prior to the date hereof with
respect to any Takeover Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such third party (or its agents or advisors) in
possession of non-public information in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such information.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.04(a), prior to the receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board, directly or
indirectly through any Representative, may, subject to Section 5.04(c) (i) participate in negotiations or discussions with any third
party that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide, unsolicited Takeover Proposal orally or in writing that the Company Board
believes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to such third party non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement that constitutes an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which confidentiality agreement shall be promptly (in all events within forty-eight (48)

Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (iv) following the occurrence of an Intervening Event, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, and/or (v) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take (which

action would reasonably be expected to cause the Company Board to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board from disclosing to the Company’s stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Takeover Proposal, if the Company
determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such position would constitute a violation of
applicable Law.

(c) The Company may respond to unsolicited inbound inquiries (orally or in writing) from third parties that communicate an
interest in pursuing a Takeover Proposal but the Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) through
(iii) of Section 5.04(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to Buyer a prior written notice advising Buyer that it intends to
take such action. The Company shall notify Buyer promptly (but in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours) after it obtains
Knowledge of the receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Takeover Proposal, any inquiry that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third
party. In such notice, the Company shall identify the third party making, and details of the material terms and conditions of, any
such Takeover Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall promptly (and within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Buyer of the
status and material terms of any such Takeover Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or proposed
amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company shall provide Buyer with at least forty-eight (48) hours
prior notice of any meeting of the Company Board (or such lesser notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board) at
which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly provide Buyer
with a list of any non-public information concerning the Company’s business, present or future performance, financial condition or
results of operations, provided to any third party, and, to the extent such information has not been previously provided to Buyer,
copies of such information.

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 5.04(d), the Company Board shall not make any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time prior to the receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, if: (i) the Company promptly
notifies Buyer, in writing, at least five (5) Business Days (the “Notice Period”) before making a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or entering into (or causing a Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, of its
intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that the Company has received a
Takeover Proposal that the Company Board intends to declare a Superior Proposal and that the Company Board intends to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or the Company intends to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement; (ii) the
Company provides the material terms of the proposed Company Acquisition Agreement; (iii) the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, during the Notice
Period, negotiate with Buyer in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Buyer, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being
agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior
Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three (3)
Business Days remains in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Buyer of any such material revision (it
being understood that there may be multiple extensions)); and (iv) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting
with outside legal counsel and its Company Financial Advisor, that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Buyer during the Notice Period in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

Section 5.05 Stockholders Meeting; Preparation of Proxy Materials.

the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.04(b) hereof, the
Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Subject to Section 5.04 hereof, the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to (i) solicit from the holders of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger and (ii) take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the
holders of Company Common Stock required by applicable Law to obtain such approval. The Company shall keep Buyer and
Merger Sub updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as requested Buyer or Merger Sub. Once the Company Stockholders
Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the
consent of Buyer (other than (i) in order to obtain a quorum of its stockholders or (ii) as reasonably determined by the Company to
comply with applicable Law). At the Company Stockholders Meeting, Buyer and its Affiliates shall vote all shares of Company
Common Stock owned by them in favor of adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting if this Agreement
is terminated before the meeting is held.

(b) In connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement the Company shall prepare and file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC. Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company
will cooperate and consult with each other in the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each of Buyer and Merger Sub will furnish the Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall not file
the Company Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, without providing Buyer a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon (which comments shall be reasonably considered by the Company). The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve, and each party agrees to consult and cooperate with the other party in resolving, all SEC
comments with respect to the Company Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Company
Proxy Statement in definitive form to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Company’s stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable following filing with the SEC. The Company agrees to consult with Buyer prior to responding to SEC comments with
respect to the preliminary Company Proxy Statement. Each of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Company Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading and the Company
shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders an amendment or supplement setting forth such correction. The Company shall
as soon as reasonably practicable (i) notify Buyer of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the Company Proxy
Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Company Proxy Statement or for additional information and (ii)
provide Buyer with copies of all written correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Company Proxy Statement.

Section 5.07 Employees; Benefit Plans.

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the date which is twelve (12) months from the Effective
Time (or if earlier, the date of the employee’s termination of employment with Buyer and its Subsidiaries), Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
who remain employed immediately after the Effective Time (collectively, the “Company Continuing Employees”) with base
salary, target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation), and employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable than the base salary, target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation), and employee benefits provided
by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement.

(b) With respect to any “employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained by Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, excluding both any retiree healthcare plans or programs maintained by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries and any equity
compensation arrangements maintained by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, “Buyer Benefit Plans”) in which any
Company Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be as if such service were with Buyer, for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for (i) purposes of early retirement
subsidies under any Buyer Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan or (ii) benefit accrual purposes, except for vacation, if
applicable) in any Buyer Benefit Plan in which such Company Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time; provided, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that (x) such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits or (y) such service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Employee Plan.

(c) This Section 5.07 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing
in this Section 5.07, express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Section 5.07. Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend or modify
any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation, Buyer or
any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in
this Section 5.07 shall not create any right in any Company Employee or any other Person to any continued employment with the
Surviving Corporation, Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever
other than as provided in Section 5.07(a).

(d) With respect to matters described in this Section 5.07, the Company will not send any written notices or other written
communication materials to Company Employees without the prior written consent of Buyer.

Section 5.08 Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Buyer and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company
now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each an “Indemnified Party”) as provided in the
Company Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect
on the date hereof and disclosed in Section 5.08, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further
action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms,
and, in the event that any proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final disposition of such
proceeding or claim.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation (the “Indemnifying Parties”) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions in their
capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), and shall reimburse each Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
Party in

connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines as
such expenses are incurred, subject to the Surviving Corporation’s receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay
such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law; provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporation’s prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Additionally, the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification
than are set forth in the Company’s current certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner than would adversely in any
manner affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors or officers of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) maintain in effect for a period of
six (6) years after the Effective Time, if available, the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies, of
at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries when compared to the insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof), or
(ii) obtain as of the Effective Time “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred
before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however,
that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement,
which amount is set forth on Section of the Company Disclosure Letter (the “Maximum Premium”). If such insurance coverage
cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation will obtain, and
Buyer will cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, that amount of directors’ and officers’ insurance (or “tail” coverage)
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

(d) The obligations of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.08 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section
5.08 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom
this Section 5.08 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.08, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this
Section 5.08).

(e) In the event Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.08. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of
any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.08 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any
such claims under any such policies.

Section 5.09 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including those contained in this Section 5.09),
each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, and to satisfy all conditions to, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary permits, waivers, consents, approvals and
actions or nonactions from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action
or proceeding by, any Governmental Entities, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents or waivers from third parties, and (iii) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of
this Agreement. Buyer will take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Company and Buyer shall, subject to
applicable Law, promptly (x) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the taking of the actions contemplated by clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) immediately above and (y) supply the other with any information that may be reasonably required in order to effectuate the
taking of such actions. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the Company
or Buyer receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then it shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request, and, if
permitted by applicable Law and by any applicable Governmental Entity, provide the other party’s counsel with advance notice and
the opportunity to attend and participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing made thereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Buyer nor the Company shall commit to or agree (or
permit their respective Subsidiaries to commit to or agree) with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of the other (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(b) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a
Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other
agreement contemplated hereby, the Company shall cooperate in all respects with Buyer and Merger Sub and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of Buyer, Merger
Sub or any of their Affiliates shall be required to defend, contest or resist any action or proceeding, whether judicial or
administrative, or to take any action to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) None of Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to, and the Company may not, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (i) other than pursuant to Section 5.01 hereto, sell, license,
assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the

Section 7.03(b)) or the Company Stockholders Meeting (in the case of termination pursuant to Section 7.02(c)), a Takeover
Proposal shall (1) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(c), have been publicly disclosed and not
withdrawn or (2) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.03(b), have been publicly disclosed or otherwise made or
communicated to the Company or the Company Board, and not withdrawn, and (B) within twelve (12) months following the date
of such termination of this Agreement the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any Takeover
Proposal, or any Takeover Proposal shall have been consummated (in each case whether or not such Takeover Proposal is the same
as the original Takeover Proposal made, communicated or publicly disclosed), then in any such event the Company shall pay to
Buyer (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), immediately prior to and as a condition to consummating such transaction,
the Termination Fee (it being understood for all purposes of this Section 7.06(c), all references in the definition of Takeover
Proposal to 15% shall be deemed to be references to “more than 50%” instead). If a Person (other than Buyer) makes a Takeover
Proposal that has been publicly disclosed and subsequently withdrawn prior to such termination or the Company Stockholder
Meeting, as applicable, and, within twelve (12) months following the date of the termination of this Agreement, such Person or any
of its controlled Affiliates makes a Takeover Proposal that is publicly disclosed, such initial Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to
have been “not withdrawn” for purposes of clauses (1) and (2) of this paragraph (c).

(d) The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that the provisions of this Section 7.06 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and that, without such provisions, Buyer and Merger Sub
would not have entered into this Agreement. If the Company shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this
Section 7.06, and, in order to obtain such payment, Buyer makes a claim against the Company that results in a judgment against the
Company, the Company shall pay to Buyer the reasonable costs and expenses of Buyer (including its reasonable attorneys’ fees and
expenses) incurred or accrued in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 7.06 at
the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal. Any interest payable hereunder shall
be calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until (but excluding) the date of actual payment,
and on the basis of a 360-day year. The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(e) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 7.06, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby will be paid by the party incurring such Expenses.

Section 7.07 Amendment.  At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any
and all respects, whether before or after receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, by written agreement signed by each of the parties
hereto; provided, however, that following the receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, there shall be no amendment or supplement to
the provisions of this Agreement which by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant self-regulatory organization would
require further approval by the holders of Company Common Stock without such approval.

Section 7.08 Extension; Waiver.  At any time prior to the Effective Time, Buyer or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the
Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other party(ies), (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party(ies) contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered under this Agreement, or (c) unless prohibited by applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any extension or waiver will be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights.

FAIRNESS OPINION

April 25, 2017

Special Committee of the Board of Directors
Sajan, Inc.
645 Whitetail Blvd.
River Falls, WI 54022

Dear Special Committee:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be paid to the
shareholders of Sajan, Inc. (“Sajan” or the “Company”) in the proposed plan of merger with Amplexor USA, Inc. (“Amplexor” or
the “Buyer”) and Amplexor FALCON, Inc. (“Merger Sub”) (the “Merger”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the“Agreement”)
among Sajan and Amplexor, the Buyer will enter into a business combination transaction whereby the Merger Sub will merge with
and into the Company with the Company as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer. In the Merger,
each share of common stock of the Company will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration of $5.83 per
share, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.

In connection with our opinion, we have:

(a) considered a draft dated April 14, 2017 of the Agreement and related documents and agreements;

(b) considered certain financial and other information relating to the Company that was publicly available or furnished to us by
the Company, including financial forecasts;

(c) considered certain financial data of the Company and compared that data with similar data for other publicly-held companies
in businesses similar to those of the Company;

(e) considered the financial terms, to the extent publicly available of certain recent public acquisitions of companies in
businesses similar to those of the Company; and

(f) considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria
as we deemed relevant and appropriate for purposes of this opinion.

The opinions expressed herein are subject to the following additional qualifications and limitations:

(i) In arriving at our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of all financial and other information that was publicly available or furnished to us by Company. With respect
to the financial forecasts examined by us, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance of the Company.

(ii) We have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets of the Company, nor have we been furnished with
any such appraisals.

(iii)We express no opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any officers,
directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Merger
Consideration to be received by holders of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise.

(iv)Our opinion does not address, and should not be construed to address, either the underlying business decision to effect the
Merger and we express no view as to the federal, state or local tax consequences of the Merger.

(v) Our opinion is based on business, economic, market and other conditions as they exist as of the date hereof or as of the date
of the information provided to us.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(vi)We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement without
material modification waiver or delay, and that in connection with the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals for the
Merger, no restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to
be derived in the proposed Merger.

(vii)This opinion is effective as of the date hereof. We have no obligation to update the opinion unless requested by you in
writing to do so and expressly disclaim any responsibility to do so in the absence of any such request.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Company and the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion,
and a significant portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, we were requested to provide
advice concerning the structure of the Merger and did participate in negotiations with respect to the terms of the Merger and related
transactions. Please note that Dougherty is a full service broker dealer engaged in securities trading, research, investment
management and brokerage services. In the ordinary course of its trading, brokerage, investment management and financing
activities, Dougherty or its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities of the Company for its own account or for the
accounts of its customers or its managed investment accounts and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions in such
securities.

The issuance of this opinion was approved by a fairness opinion committee of Dougherty & Company LLC. This letter is for
the information of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors in connection with the Merger described herein. This opinion
may not be quoted or referred to, in whole or in part, filed with, or furnished or disclosed publicly or privately to any other party, or
used for any other purpose, without Dougherty’s prior written consent; provided, however, that this opinion may be reproduced in
full in the proxy statement to be provided to the Company’s shareholders in connection with the Merger. Any description or
reference to us or our opinion in the proxy statement (or any other publicly available document or regulatory filing), however, shall
be subject to our prior review and approval. This opinion does not address the underlying business decision to enter the Merger,
does not address the prices at which the Company’s common stock may trade at any time and expresses no opinion as to how the
shareholders of the Company should vote at a shareholders’ meeting, if any, held to consider the Merger.

On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Merger Consideration of $5.83 per
share to be paid in the proposed Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of the Company.

Sincerely,

ANNEX C
 

SECTION 262 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to §228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court
of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of
this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock”
and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other
instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to §251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to §251(g) of this title and, subject to
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, §251(h) of this title), §252, §254, §255, §256, §257, §258, §263 or §264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in §363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record
date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of
merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000
holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation
surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as
provided in §251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of
merger or consolidation pursuant to §§251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock
anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in
respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be
either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b.
of this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under §251(h), §253 or §267
of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the
subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by §363(a) of this title,
appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by §363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set
forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted for
the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent corporation” and/or
“surviving or resulting corporation.”

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for
the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or
consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance
with §255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this
section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such
notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of §114 of this title. Each
stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to
demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such
a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10
days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder
of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger
or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to §228, §251(h), §253, or §267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within
10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled
to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of
such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of
the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of §114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by
§251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such
notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent
corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of
any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the

effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all
such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20
days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, later than the
later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by §251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first
notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded
appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the
transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either
notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the
notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date
shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be
the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any
stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights,
may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the
stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall
have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or
consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation
surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor
of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of
holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written
request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for
delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of
this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of
such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this
subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was
filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and
with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition
shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register
in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or
certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such
notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the
notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting
corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who
have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares
and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon
of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of
the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall
dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of
shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the
consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was
approved pursuant to §253 or §267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in
accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such
proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair
value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger
through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger
and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation
may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided
herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by
the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation
or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the
appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the
list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of
the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be
enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder
in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as
provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to
the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the
time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written
withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days
after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written
approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the
right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a

further Base Salary payments or benefits after the date of termination.

5.2.By Notice, Without Cause. The Employer may terminate Employee’s employment at any time without Cause. In the event

continue to pay the Employee his Base Salary at the rate in effect on the date of termination [IF COVERED BY PLAN –
 along with health insurance premiums for hospitalization and major medical for himself and his legal dependents (family
coverage) on the same basis as when Employee was employed]. Any obligation of the Employer to the Employee under this

Employer at the time of termination. (“Release of Claims”).

5.3.By Notice from Employee Without Cause. Employee shall have the right to terminate his employment upon six (6) months
advance written notice to the Employer. Employer may, at its sole discretion, accelerate the termination date without
triggering any other termination or payment provision of this Agreement, including making such termination effective
immediately.

“Good Cause,” which, for purposes of this Agreement shall mean:

a. a material diminution in authority, duties, or responsibilities;

7. Confidential Information. Employee agrees not to directly or indirectly use or disclose any Confidential Information of the
Employer or its customers for the benefit of anyone other than the Employer either during the course of employment or after the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

a. Transfer or record the transfer of Employee’s entire right, title and interest in Inventions; and

b. Enable the Employer to obtain patent, copyright or trademark protection for Inventions anywhere in the world.

The obligations of Employee under this Section 8 will continue beyond the termination of employment with respect to
Inventions conceived or made by Employee during the period of Employee’s employment and will be binding upon assigns,
executors, administrators and other legal representatives. For purposes of this Agreement, any Invention relating to the
Business of the Employer on which Employee markets a new competitive product, files a patent application or seeks
copyright protection within one (1) year after termination of employment with the Employer will be presumed to be an
Invention conceived by Employee during the term of Employee’s employment, subject to proof to the contrary by good
faith, written and duly corroborated records establishing that such Invention was conceived and made following termination
of employment.

8.2.Employee’s Own Inventions. This Agreement does not apply to any Invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility or
trade-secret information of the Employer was used, which was developed entirely on Employee’s own time, and (a) which
does not relate directly to the Business or to the Employer’s actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of
the Confidential Information and (b) which does not result from any work performed by Employee for the Employer.

9. Competition/Non-Solicitation. Employee hereby acknowledges that the following provisions of this Agreement are reasonable
and necessary for the Employer’s protection. Employee further acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 9 were a
condition of the Employer’s offer to employ Employee. Employee acknowledges that these benefits constitute sufficient
consideration for this Agreement. The term of this Agreement, and for a period of six (6) months from the date Employee ceases
to be employed with the Employer shall be the Restricted Period (“Restricted Period'')

9.1.No Solicitation of Customers or Suppliers. During the term of this Agreement, and during the Restricted Period,
regardless of the reason for termination, Employee agrees to not, directly or indirectly (on Employee’s own behalf or in
association with any other individual or entity), solicit, sell to or service any former or current customers of the Employer
about whom Employee had confidential information, or with whom he actually did business and had personal contact while
employed by Employer, except to the extent such activities are unrelated to, and not competitive with, the business, products
and/or services that Employee offered or provided on behalf of Employer and cannot adversely affect Employer’s
relationship or volume of business with such customers. Employee specifically acknowledges that this restriction is
necessary and reasonable for the protection of Employer's customer goodwill, and that it will not prevent Employee from
being gainfully employed following termination of employment with Employer.

9.2.No Solicitation of Employees or Contractors. During the term of this Agreement, and during the Restricted Period,
regardless of the reason for termination, Employee agrees to not, directly or indirectly (on Employee’s own behalf or in
association with any other individual or entity), employ, solicit for employment, encourage or otherwise cause to leave their
employment or engagement with the Employer any person who was during the twelve (12) months prior to such
employment, solicitation or encouragement or is then an officer, employee or contractor of the Employer. Employee further
specifically acknowledges that this restriction is necessary and reasonable for the protection of Company's customer
goodwill, and that it will not prevent Employee from being gainfully employed following termination of employment with
Employer.

10. Remedies for Breach. Employee recognizes that if he violates any portion of Sections 7, 8 or 9 of this Agreement, irreparable
damage will result to the Employer that could not be remedied entirely or adequately by monetary damages. As a result,
Employee hereby agrees that in the event of any breach by Employee, or in the event of apparent danger of such breach, the
Employer will be entitled, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies available to the Employer, to an injunction to
restrain the violation of any and all such portions of this Agreement by Employee.
