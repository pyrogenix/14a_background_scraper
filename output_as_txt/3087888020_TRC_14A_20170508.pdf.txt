Dear Fellow Stockholder:

        You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of our stockholders, to be held at The Bostonian Boston Hotel, located at 26 North Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109,
on June 8, 2017 at 2:00 p.m., Eastern time.

        On March 30, 2017, TRC Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (herein "we," "our," "us" and the "Company"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"Merger Agreement") with Bolt Infrastructure Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and Bolt Infrastructure Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"). Parent and Merger Sub are entities affiliated with New Mountain Capital, L.L.C. Under the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will
merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. This transaction is referred to as the "Merger."

        If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $17.55 in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding on account of taxes, for each share of the
Company's common stock that you own immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (unless you have properly exercised appraisal rights under Delaware law), which
represents a premium of approximately 46.9% to the closing price of our common stock on March 30, 2017, which was the last full trading day before the Company's Board of
Directors approved the Merger Agreement, and 62.0% to the average closing price of our common stock for the trading days during the 30-day period that ended on March 30,
2017.

        At the special meeting, stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, (2) a proposal to approve, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the completion of the Merger and (3) a proposal
to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

        The Board of Directors of the Company carefully reviewed and considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby
are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, and has approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, the Board of Directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of the Company vote "FOR"
each of the foregoing proposals. Approval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is necessary to complete the Merger.

        Your vote is very important. The Merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote
at the special meeting vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please complete, date, sign and return, as
promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or submit your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or
the Internet. The failure to vote your shares of common stock will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" approval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

        The obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to complete the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions. The accompanying proxy
statement contains detailed

information about us, the special meeting, the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the Merger-related proposals. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to the
proxy statement. We encourage you to read the entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by reference. In addition, you may obtain
more information about the Company from documents that it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See "Where You Can Find More Information."

        Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved the Merger, passed upon the merits or
fairness of the Merger, or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

  Sincerely,

  

  
Christopher P. Vincze
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
May 8, 2017

To Our Stockholders:

        A special meeting of the stockholders of TRC Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (herein "we," "our," "us" and the "Company"), will be held at 2:00 p.m., Eastern
time, on June 8, 2017 (the doors will open to the public at 1:00 p.m., Eastern time), at The Bostonian Boston Hotel, located at 26 North Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, to
consider and take action on the following items:

1. To adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 30, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among the Company, Bolt Infrastructure Parent, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and Bolt Infrastructure Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware Corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"),
whereby Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation (the "Merger"). 

2. To approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with
the completion of the Merger. 

3. To approve a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at that time to approve
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

        Your vote is very important. We cannot consummate the Merger unless we receive the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon.

        Even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, we request that you complete, sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card or voting
instruction form in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or submit your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or the Internet prior to the special meeting to ensure that
your shares of common stock of the Company will be represented and voted at the special meeting if you are unable to attend. Failure to return your proxy card or voting
instruction form, or failure to submit your proxy or voting instructions by phone or the Internet, will result in your shares of common stock not being counted for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. For more
information concerning the special meeting, the Merger Agreement, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, please review the accompanying
proxy statement and the copy of the Merger Agreement attached as Annex A thereto.

        All stockholders at the close of business on May 8, 2017, the record date with respect to the special meeting, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting and
any adjournment or postponement thereof.

        If you plan to attend the special meeting in person, you must obtain an admission ticket in advance. For more details on our admission procedures, please refer to pages 28 to
29 of the accompanying proxy statement.

        The Company's Board of Directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and has submitted it to the Company's stockholders for consideration and
adoption at the special meeting. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" each of the foregoing proposals.

        Any stockholder of the Company who is entitled to, but does not, vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement (or consent thereto in writing) will have the right to
seek appraisal of the fair value of such stockholder's shares of common stock, as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL") if such stockholder delivers a demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the Merger Agreement and complies with all the other requirements of
Delaware law, including Section 262 of the DGCL, which is summarized in the accompanying proxy statement and reproduced in its entirety in Annex C to the accompanying
proxy statement.

        This proxy statement is dated May 8, 2017 and is first being mailed to our stockholders on or about May 10, 2017.

  By order of the Board of Directors,

  

  
Martin H. Dodd
Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary

Table of Contents

        Parent and Merger Sub are affiliated with New Mountain Capital, L.L.C. ("NMC"), a growth-oriented investment firm based in New York that currently manages
private equity, public equity and credit funds with approximately $15 billion in aggregate capital commitments.

The Merger (pages 31-62) 

        The Merger Agreement provides that Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions, set forth in the Merger
Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, and we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. We will be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation"). As a result of the Merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company.

Merger Consideration 

        In the Merger, each outstanding share of our common stock issued and outstanding (other than shares that we, Parent or Merger Sub own and shares held by a holder
who is entitled to but did not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement (or consent thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand and properly demands
appraisal of such shares (the "Dissenting Shares")) will be automatically converted into the right to receive in cash an amount equal to $17.55 per share, without interest
(the "Merger Consideration"), less applicable tax withholding. See "The Merger—Merger Consideration," on page 31, for further details regarding the Merger
Consideration.

Treatment of Common Stock and Company Equity Awards (pages 64-65) 

Common Stock

        At the time that a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger is filed with, and accepted by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as
is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the certificate of merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
thereto (other than shares that we, Parent or Merger Sub own and Dissenting Shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. All
shares owned by us, Parent or Merger Sub will be automatically canceled and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. Our common
stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of Dissenting Shares pursuant to, and in compliance in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL will be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the appraisal rights described under "Appraisal Rights Under Delaware
Law," beginning on page 87, and such Dissenting Shares will be automatically canceled and cease to exist.

Company Equity Awards

        The Merger Agreement provides for the treatment as of the Effective Time of the stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance stock units ("PSUs")
that are outstanding under our stock incentive plans (collectively, the "Company Equity Awards") as summarized below. All amounts paid pursuant to the settlement of
Company Equity Awards at the Effective Time will be made by the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than
the first payroll date that is at least five business days after the closing of the Merger.

Stock Options 

        Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing between any holder of stock options and Parent, each outstanding unvested and
unexercised option to purchase shares of our common stock will become immediately vested and exercisable in full. At the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option
will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash

equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares for which the option remains outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of the option, without interest and less applicable tax withholding. Any stock option that is
outstanding at the Effective Time of the Merger that has an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled without payment.

Restricted Stock Units 

        Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing between any holder of RSUs and Parent, all outstanding unvested RSUs will become
immediately vested, and all restrictions on such awards will lapse. At the Effective Time, outstanding RSUs will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of RSUs held immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration, without interest and
less applicable tax withholding.

Performance Stock Units 

        Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing between any holder of PSUs and Parent, all outstanding PSUs will become vested in
amounts corresponding to actual achievement of applicable performance goals for such PSUs. If the Effective Time occurs prior to June 30, 2017, the Compensation
Committee of our Board of Directors (the "Board") will determine in good faith the amount of PSUs that will vest by assuming achievement of performance goals for any
portion of the applicable performance period that had not been completed, taking into consideration our historical levels of performance with respect to the applicable
performance goals. At the Effective Time, vested PSUs will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total
number of vested PSUs held immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration, without interest and less applicable tax withholding.

The Special Meeting (pages 24-30) 

        The special meeting of our stockholders will be held at The Bostonian Boston Hotel, located at 26 North Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, on June 8, 2017 at 2:00
p.m., Eastern time. The doors will open to the public at 1:00 p.m., Eastern time. At the special meeting, our stockholders will be asked to take the following actions:

• approve a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (the "Merger Proposal"); 

• approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the
completion of the Merger (the "Merger Compensation Proposal"); and 

• approve an adjournment of the special meeting, if submitted for a vote, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
adjournment to adopt the Merger Agreement (the "Adjournment Proposal").

        See "The Special Meeting," beginning on page 24, for additional information.

a quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting, except that a quorum is not required for a vote on the Adjournment Proposal.

Stockholder Vote Required to Adopt Each Proposal (page 25) 

        Each share of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote at the special meeting on each matter properly brought
before the special meeting.

        Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock that are outstanding and entitled to vote
thereon at the close of business on the record date. A failure to vote your shares of common stock, an abstention from voting or a broker non-vote will have the same effect
as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal.

        Approval of each of the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of our common stock that are present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote thereon. An abstention will have the same effect as a vote
"AGAINST" these proposals, but the failure to vote your shares or a broker non-vote will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals.

        As of May 8, 2017, the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 2,212,121 shares of our
common stock, representing approximately 7.0% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. We currently expect that our directors and executive officers will vote all
such shares "FOR" the Merger Proposal, "FOR" the Merger Compensation Proposal and "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal, although none of them is obligated to do
so.

        Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, The Clark Estates, Inc. ("Clark Estates"), which held approximately 17.6% of the outstanding
shares of our common stock as of March 30, 2017, delivered to Parent and Merger Sub a voting and support agreement (the "Voting and Support Agreement"), pursuant to
which Clark Estates agreed, among other things, to vote its shares in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. See "The Special Meeting—Voting and Support Agreement," on page 26, and Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement,
which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, for additional information.

Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of The Board (pages 37-41) 

        The Board, after carefully considering the factors described in the section entitled "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of The Board," beginning
on page 37, and after consulting with its legal and financial advisors, has unanimously determined that the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated by it, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders and has approved and declared advisable the Merger
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby.

        The Board unanimously recommends that you vote:

• "FOR" the Merger Proposal; 

• "FOR" the Merger Compensation Proposal; and 

• "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal.

        For a more complete discussion of the recommendations of the Board and its reasons for approving the Merger Agreement and the circumstances under which the
Board may change its recommendation with respect to the Merger Proposal, see the sections entitled "The Merger—Reasons

Opinion of Houlihan Lokey (pages 41-47) 

        We retained Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. ("Houlihan Lokey") to act as our financial advisor in connection with a possible merger, consolidation, business
combination, sale or other similar strategic transaction. On March 30, 2017, Houlihan Lokey verbally rendered its opinion to the Board (which was subsequently
confirmed in writing by delivery of Houlihan Lokey's written opinion addressed to the Board dated March 30, 2017), as to, as of March 30, 2017, the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to our stockholders, of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

        Houlihan Lokey's opinion was directed to the Board (in its capacity as such) and only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, to our
stockholders, of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement and did not address any other aspect
or implication of the Merger, any related transaction or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection therewith or otherwise.
The summary of Houlihan Lokey's opinion in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of its written opinion, which is attached
as Annex B to this proxy statement and describes the procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken and other
matters considered by Houlihan Lokey in connection with the preparation of its opinion. However, neither Houlihan Lokey's opinion nor the summary of its
opinion and the related analyses set forth in this proxy statement are intended to be, and do not constitute, advice or a recommendation to the Board, the
Company, any of our security holders or any other person as to how to act or vote with respect to any matter relating to the Merger or otherwise.

Financing the Merger (pages 51-53) 

        The Merger is not subject to a financing condition. We anticipate that the total funds needed by Parent and Merger Sub to complete the Merger (including the funds to
pay our stockholders and the holders of Company Equity Awards, to pay related fees in connection with the Merger and associated transactions, and to repay our
indebtedness that will be payable as a result of the Merger, including approximately $57.0 million that we expect to be outstanding as of that time under our Credit
Agreement, dated as of January 31, 2017, with Citizens Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, BMO Harris Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, KeyBank, National
Association, as documentation agent, and the lenders from time to time party thereto (the "Credit Agreement")) will be approximately $664.0 million, which we expect
will be funded through a combination of the following:

• an equity financing, as described below; 

• a debt financing, as described below; and 

• cash of the Company expected to be on hand and available at the closing.

Equity Commitments (page 52)

        Parent has entered into a letter agreement, dated as of March 30, 2017 with New Mountain Partners IV, L.P. (the "Equity Investor"), an investment fund managed by
an affiliate of NMC (the "Equity Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which the Equity Investor (or other parties to whom it delegates a portion of its commitment)
committed to capitalize Parent, contemporaneous with the closing of the Merger, with an aggregate equity financing commitment of up to $665.0 million, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein. Parent plans to finance a portion of the amounts required to complete the Merger pursuant to such equity financing.

Table of Contents

        On March 30, 2017, the Equity Investor provided a limited guarantee in favor of the Company (the "Guarantee"). Pursuant to the Guarantee, the Equity Investor has
agreed to guarantee the payment, if and when required and due, of all of the liabilities and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, including
certain cost and reimbursement obligations specified in the Merger Agreement and monetary damages claimed by the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement, all of
which are subject to an aggregate cap of approximately $38.8 million.

        We expect that the amount committed under the Equity Commitment Letter, together with cash of the Company expected to be on hand and available at the closing,
would, in the absence of a debt financing, be sufficient to complete the Merger, pay related fees in connection with the Merger and related transactions and to repay the
amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement, but we cannot assure you of that. The proceeds of any such equity and cash financing could be insufficient if, among
other things, the Equity Investor fails to purchase its committed amount in breach of the Equity Commitment Letter, or if our indebtedness or the fees required to be paid to
complete the Merger are greater than anticipated.

        For more information regarding the equity commitments, see "The Merger—Financing the Merger—Equity Commitments," on page 52.

Debt Financing (pages 52-53)

        Parent also plans to finance a portion of the amounts required to complete the Merger by conducting a debt financing, which may take the form of a revolving credit
facility, a term loan facility, a bridge facility or a note offering. Subject to certain customary exceptions, we have agreed to, agreed to cause our subsidiaries to, and agreed
to use reasonable best efforts to require our and their representatives to, provide Parent with customary and necessary cooperation as reasonably requested by Parent or
Merger Sub to assist them in arranging the debt financing to be obtained in connection with the Merger.

        For more information regarding the planned debt financing, see "The Merger—Financing the Merger—Debt Financing," beginning on page 52.

Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (pages 53-58) 

        In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposed Merger, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have certain
interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these interests,
among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by our
stockholders. These interests include the following:

• the expectation that certain of our executive officers may enter into agreements with Parent or Merger Sub regarding employment with the Surviving
Corporation or regarding the right to purchase or participate in the equity of the Surviving Corporation prior to or following the closing of the Merger; 

• accelerated vesting and cash-out of Company Equity Awards based on the Merger Consideration; 

• our obligation to pay transaction or completion bonuses to certain of our executive officers within a specified time period following the closing of the
Merger; 

• our obligation to make cash payments to Christopher Vincze, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and to provide Mr. Vincze with benefit
continuation for up to two years following his termination (or a cash payment in lieu thereof) if we terminate his employment for any reason other than
death, disability or cause, or he terminates his employment with us for good reason;

• our obligation to pay severance benefits to each executive officer other than Mr. Vincze and Thomas W. Bennet, Jr., our Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer, if we terminate such executive officer's employment without cause or the executive officer resigns for good reason during the period
beginning six months prior to consummation of the Merger and ending on the second anniversary of the consummation of the Merger; and 

• continued indemnification and insurance coverage for our directors and executive officers from the Surviving Corporation and Parent under the terms of the
Merger Agreement.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (pages 60-62) 

        The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger generally will be treated as a taxable sale of the shares for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Exchanging stockholders generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to
the exchanged shares and their adjusted tax basis in these shares. Exchanging stockholders who are U.S. holders (as defined in "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger," beginning on page 60) generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any such gain. In addition, backup withholding
generally will apply to the cash payments paid to a non-corporate U.S. holder pursuant to the Merger unless such U.S. holder provides a taxpayer identification number,
certifies that such number is correct and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules. You should read "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger," beginning on page 60, for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. You should also consult
your tax advisor for a complete analysis of the effect of the Merger on your federal, state, local and/or foreign taxes.

No Solicitation of Competing Proposals (pages 71-74) 

        The Merger Agreement provides that from March 30, 2017 until the Effective Time, we, our subsidiaries and our representatives are not permitted to, directly or
indirectly:

• solicit, facilitate, initiate or knowingly encourage or induce any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes a competing proposal, as described in the section
entitled "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals," or any inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to such a
proposal; 

• enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any information or data with respect to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, a competing proposal; 

• approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a competing proposal; 

• enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent, term sheet, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement) providing for or facilitating or endorsing a competing proposal, or any contract, agreement
or arrangement requiring that we abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; or 

• furnish any information relating to us or any of our subsidiaries to any person, or to allow any person access to our business, properties, assets, books,
records or other information, or to any

of our personnel or our subsidiaries' personnel (in each case, other than Parent, its and our affiliates and representatives of the parties and their affiliates).

        However, if we receive a bona fide written competing proposal from any third party (that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger
Agreement) before receiving stockholder approval of the Merger Proposal, we may contact the party making the proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof.
If the competing proposal constitutes a "superior proposal," as described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals," or if
the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that the competing proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a
"superior proposal," we may (i) furnish non-public information to the person making the competing proposal if the person executes an acceptable confidentiality
agreement and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with the person making the competing proposal. With respect to each of these permissible activities, however, we
must comply with certain provisions of the Merger Agreement that require us, among other things, to notify Parent of any such superior proposal or any determination by
the Board that a competing proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal, to notify Parent of the receipt of a written competing proposal and the
material terms thereof, and to keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and details of any such competing proposal.

        Furthermore, at any time before receiving stockholder approval of the Merger Proposal, the Board may, if it determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with the proper exercise of its fiduciary duties to our stockholders, cause the Company to terminate the Merger
Agreement if it has received a superior proposal and, concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement, it enters into a definitive agreement with respect to the
superior proposal and pays the termination fee described below. If we terminate the Merger Agreement in this manner, we are required to comply with certain other terms
of the Merger Agreement, including providing notice to Parent and in good faith negotiating adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Guarantee, as applicable, so that the competing proposal would cease to constitute a superior proposal prior to entering into a definitive
agreement with respect to the competing proposal.

        In addition, at any time before receiving stockholder approval of the Merger Proposal, the Board may take certain actions that would be deemed to be a change of its
recommendation regarding the advisability of the Merger, following the occurrence of an "intervening event," as described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement
—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals," if it determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
proper exercise of its fiduciary duties to our stockholders, so long as we comply with certain terms of the Merger Agreement, including providing notice to Parent and in
good faith negotiating adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Guarantee, as applicable.

        See "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals," beginning on page 71, and "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by the
Company," beginning on page 81.

Conditions to the Merger (pages 78-79) 

        The respective obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, waiver of certain conditions, including the following:

• adoption of the Merger Agreement by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon;

• the absence of any order or injunction preventing consummation of the Merger; 

• expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) relating to the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act"), which waiting period was terminated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") on April 25, 2017; 

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties, subject to certain materiality qualifications and other exceptions; 

• the absence of any change, effect, occurrence, development, circumstance, condition, state of facts or event occurring after March 30, 2017 that has had or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a "Company Material Adverse Effect," as defined in the Merger Agreement; and 

• performance or compliance by the parties in all material respects with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement.

        The Merger is not subject to a financing condition.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (pages 79-81) 

        The Merger Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned under the following circumstances:

• by us and Parent by mutual written agreement; 

• by either Parent or us, if: 

• the Effective Time has not occurred by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on July 31, 2017 (the "Outside Date"), subject to certain exceptions further
described in "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement," beginning on page 79; 

• a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that is within a jurisdiction material to our business and operations has issued a final, non-
appealable order, decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement; provided that this termination right will not be available to a party whose breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the Merger Agreement has been the primary cause of the issuance of the order, decree or ruling;
or 

• the Merger Agreement is not adopted by our stockholders at the special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, in each case at
which a vote on such adoption was taken; provided that this termination right will not be available to us if we breach any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in the Merger Agreement, and such breach has been the primary cause of our failure to obtain stockholder approval at the
special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

this termination right will not be available to us if we are then in material breach of any of our representations, warranties, covenants or agreements

Sub) would not be satisfied; or

determined in good faith (after consulting with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to accept such superior proposal
would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties, we have complied in all material respects with our obligations with respect to solicitations
of competing proposals and we enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the superior proposal simultaneously with the termination of the
Merger Agreement and pay the termination fee (as described in "The Merger—Termination Fee Payable by the Company") to Parent concurrently
with such termination;

• prior to the Effective Time, we have breached any of our representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the Merger Agreement, and such

being satisfied and such breach is not curable prior to the Outside Date, or if curable prior to the Outside Date, it has not been cured within the
earlier of 30 calendar days after the receipt of notice thereof from Parent or three business days before the Outside Date; provided that this
termination right will not be available to Parent if Parent or Merger Sub are then in material breach of any of representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in the Merger Agreement such that conditions to the Merger (other than the conditions to the Merger specifically imposed on us) would
not be satisfied; or

Merger and adoption of the Merger Agreement or (ii) we otherwise breach our obligations with respect to solicitations of competing proposals (both

provided that the exercise of this termination right by Parent must occur within 10 business days of the change in recommendation in the case of
(i) or within 10 business days following the date Parent first becomes aware of the breach in the case of (ii).

Termination Fee Payable by the Company 

        We have agreed to pay Parent or its designee a termination fee of approximately $19.4 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under the following
circumstances:

• prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders:

the Merger and adoption of the Merger Agreement or (ii) we otherwise breach our obligations with respect to solicitations of competing proposals
(both events in (i) and (ii) as described in more detail in "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals," beginning on

• we terminate the Merger Agreement because the Board (or any committee thereof) has received a superior proposal or has determined in good faith
(after consulting with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to accept the superior proposal would be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties, we have complied in all material respects with our obligations with respect to solicitations of competing proposals, and
simultaneously with the termination of the Merger Agreement, we enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the superior proposal and pay
the termination fee to Parent concurrently with such termination.

        In addition, we are required to pay the termination fee if:

• (i) we or Parent terminate the Merger Agreement because the Effective Time has not occurred by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the Outside Date (but in the
case of a termination by us, only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating the Merger Agreement if its breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement has been the primary cause of the Effective Time not occurring prior to the Outside Date), (ii) we or Parent terminate the
Merger Agreement because our stockholders do not adopt the Merger Agreement, or (iii) Parent terminates the Merger Agreement because we have

(other than the conditions to the Merger specifically imposed on Parent and Merger Sub) not being satisfied and such breach is not curable prior to the
Outside Date, or if curable prior to the Outside Date, it has not been cured within the earlier of 30 calendar days after the receipt of notice thereof from
Parent or three business days before the Outside Date; 

• any person has publicly disclosed a bona fide competing proposal after March 30, 2017 and prior to such termination and such competing proposal has not
been publicly withdrawn prior to such termination; and 

• during the period commencing on March 30, 2017 and ending 12 months following such termination, we enter into a definitive agreement providing for a
competing proposal (which proposal is subsequently consummated, whether during or following such 12-month period) or consummate a transaction
contemplated by such a proposal, subject to certain adjustments to the meaning of "competing proposal," as described in "The Merger—Termination Fee
Payable by the Company," beginning on page 81.

        In no event will we be required to pay the termination fee on more than one occasion. If we fail to pay the termination fee, should it become due, in a timely manner,
and Parent commences a proceeding that results in a final non-appealable judgment in its favor, we will be required to pay Parent's reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such proceeding, together with accrued interest from the date such payment was
required to be made. See "The Merger—Termination Fee Payable by the Company," beginning on page 81, for additional information.

Regulatory Waiting Period and Approval Required for Merger (page 60) 

        The Merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, which prevented Parent and us from completing the Merger until required information and materials were
furnished to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ"), and the FTC and the HSR Act waiting period terminated or expired. On April 13,
2017, we and Parent filed the requisite notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC. On April 25, 2017, the FTC granted early termination
of the 30-day waiting period under the HSR Act, with respect to the Merger. The grant of early termination has the effect of satisfying the HSR Act condition under the
Merger Agreement.

Table of Contents

        The Merger Agreement generally requires each party promptly to use its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections that may be asserted under any law that would
delay, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, subject to certain limitations. See "The Merger—Regulatory Waiting
Period and Approval Required for Merger" and "The Merger Agreement—Efforts to Obtain Regulatory Approval," on pages 60 and 75, respectively, for additional
information about these matters.

Delisting and Deregistration of Our Common Stock (page 62) 

        If the Merger is completed, our common stock will no longer be traded on the NYSE and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"), and we will no longer be required to file periodic reports, current reports and proxy and information statements with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") on account of our common stock.

Appraisal Rights Under Delaware Law (pages 87-90) 

        Under the DGCL, our stockholders that do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares
of common stock in cash as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery (the "Court of Chancery"), but only if they comply fully with all of the applicable
requirements of the DGCL for exercise of such appraisal rights, which requirements are summarized in this proxy statement. Any appraisal amount determined by the
Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration. Any stockholder intending to exercise appraisal rights must, among
other things, submit a written demand for appraisal to us before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and must not vote or otherwise submit a proxy in favor
of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Failure to follow the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. Because of the complexity
of the DGCL relating to appraisal rights, if you are considering exercising your appraisal rights, we encourage you to promptly seek the advice of your own legal and
financial advisors. See "Appraisal Rights Under Delaware Law," beginning on page 87, and Annex C for additional information about these matters.

Market Price of Our Common Stock (page 91) 

        Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol "TRR." On March 30, 2017, the last full trading day prior to the public announcement of the Merger, the
closing price of our common stock was $11.95 per share. On May 8, 2017, the last practicable trading day prior to the date of this proxy statement, the closing price of our
common stock was $17.55 per share.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER 

        The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the special meeting, the Merger and the Merger Agreement.
These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder. Please refer to the "Summary Term Sheet," beginning on page 1, and
the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in this proxy statement, which you
should read carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under
"Where You Can Find More Information," beginning on page 96.

Q. What is the proposed transaction and what effect will it have on us? 

A. The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement, whereby Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, will be
merged with and into the Company with the Company being the Surviving Corporation. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by our stockholders
and the other closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement are satisfied or waived, and the Merger is consummated, we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease. Following the Merger, our common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under
the Exchange Act, and we will no longer be required to file periodic reports, current reports and proxy and information statements with the SEC on account of our
common stock. 

Q. What will I receive if the Merger is completed? 

A. Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive $17.55 in cash, less applicable tax withholding, for each share of our common stock that you own, unless
you are entitled to but did not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement (or consent thereto in writing) and are entitled to demand and properly demand
appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and in compliance in all respects with, the DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of our common stock, you will be entitled to
receive $1755.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of our common stock, less any applicable tax withholding. Following the Merger, you will not own any shares of the
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and will have no rights with respect to such shares other than payment of the Merger Consideration (or, if you have properly
exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal rights under the DGCL, the corresponding amount that may be determined by the Court of Chancery). 

Q. How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of our common stock prior to the announcement of the Merger? 

A. The Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 46.9% to the closing price of our common stock on March 30, 2017, the last trading day prior to the
public announcement of the proposed Merger, and 62.0% to the average closing price of our common stock for the trading days during the 30-day period that ended on
March 30, 2017. 

Q. When do you expect the Merger to be completed? 

A. We are working to consummate the Merger as soon as possible. Assuming the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible under applicable law, waiver of all of the closing
conditions, including approval by our stockholders of the Merger Proposal, we currently anticipate that the Merger will be completed by June 30, 2017.

Q. What happens if the Merger is not completed? 

A. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, you will not receive any payment for your shares in
connection with the Merger. Instead, we will remain an independent public company and our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. Under
specified circumstances, we may be required to pay to Parent a fee with respect to the termination of the Merger Agreement and certain reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with recovery of such fee, as described under "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by the Company,"
beginning on page 81. 

Q. What conditions must be satisfied to complete the Merger? 

A. We, Parent and Merger Sub are not required to complete the Merger unless a number of conditions are satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived.
These conditions include, among others: (i) receipt of approval of the Merger Proposal by holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote at the close of business on the record date; (ii) the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the
HSR Act, which waiting period was terminated on April 25, 2017; (iii) the absence of any statute, rule or regulation that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of
the Merger and the absence of any order or injunction preventing consummation of the Merger; (iv) our and each of Parent's and Merger Sub's representations and
warranties under the Merger Agreement being true and correct, subject to certain applicable materiality qualifications and other exceptions; and (v) each of us, Parent and
Merger Sub having performed in all material respects our and their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement.

For a more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the Merger, see "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the
Merger," beginning on page 78.

Although the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger is not subject to a financing condition, the Merger Agreement provides that, without
Parent's agreement, the closing of the Merger will not occur earlier than the second business day after the expiration of a "marketing period" during which Parent and
Merger Sub seeks debt financing. For a more complete summary of the marketing period, see "The Merger Agreement—Financing Cooperation; Marketing Period;
Related Indemnification," beginning on page 75.

Q. Is the Merger expected to be taxable to me? 

A. Yes. The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger generally will be treated as a taxable sale of the shares for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. If you exchange your shares of our common stock in the Merger for cash, you generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and your adjusted tax basis in such shares, and if you are a U.S. holder (as defined in "The Merger—
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger," beginning on page 60), you generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any such gain. In
addition, backup withholding may also apply to the cash payments paid if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder unless you provide a taxpayer identification number,
certify that the taxpayer identification number is correct and otherwise comply with the backup withholding rules. You should read "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger," beginning on page 60, for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. You

should also consult your tax advisor for a complete analysis of the effect of the Merger on your federal, state, local and/or foreign taxes.

Q. Why am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form? 

A. You are receiving this proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form because you own shares of our common stock. This proxy statement describes matters
relating to the Merger on which stockholders are entitled to vote and provides information to assist you in deciding how to vote your shares with respect to such matters.
Submitting an executed proxy card or voting instruction form means that you are authorizing the third parties specified on the proxy card to vote your shares at the special
meeting in the manner in which you have directed. 

Q. When and where is the special meeting? 

A. The special meeting of our stockholders will be held on June 8, 2017 at 2:00 p.m., Eastern time, at The Bostonian Boston Hotel, located at 26 North Street, Boston,
Massachusetts 02109. The doors will open to the public at 1:00 p.m., Eastern time. 

Q. What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting? 

A. You are being asked to consider and vote on the Merger Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal. 

Q. How does the Board recommend that I vote? 

A. The Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the Merger Proposal, "FOR" approval of the Merger Compensation Proposal and "FOR"
approval of the Adjournment Proposal. 

Q. Why am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding, advisory vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal? 

A. Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and SEC rules issued thereunder, we are required to conduct a non-binding, advisory vote of stockholders regarding
compensation that may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the completion of the Merger. 

Q. What will happen if our stockholders do not approve the Merger Compensation Proposal? 

A. Approval of the Merger Compensation Proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger. The vote is advisory and will not be binding on us or on Parent.
Therefore, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that is the subject of the Merger Compensation
Proposal, which includes amounts we are contractually obligated to pay, could still be paid regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote. 

Q. Do any of our directors or officers have interests in the Merger that differ from or are in addition to my interests as a stockholder? 

A. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in
the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. The Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other
matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and approving the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by our
stockholders. See "The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger," beginning on page 53.

Q. Who can vote at the special meeting? 

A. All of our stockholders of record at the close of business on May 8, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the
special meeting. Each stockholder is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before the special meeting for each share of our common stock owned by
such holder at the close of business on the record date. At the close of business on the record date, there were 31,628,280 outstanding shares of our common stock. 

Q. What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 

A. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you are considered the stockholder of record with
respect to those shares and you can attend the meeting and vote in person. You can also vote by proxy without attending the meeting in any of the other ways specified in
"The Special Meeting—Voting and Proxies—How to Vote Shares Registered in Your Own Name."

If your shares are held by a brokerage firm, trustee, bank, other financial intermediary or nominee (each, an "intermediary"), you are considered the beneficial owner of
shares held in street name, and the intermediary is considered the stockholder of record with respect to these shares. Please see "How Do I Vote?" for additional
information on voting such shares.

Q. What is a quorum? 

A. Under our bylaws, the presence at the special meeting, either in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding at the
close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting, except that a quorum is not required for a vote on the
Adjournment Proposal. 

Q. How many shares of our common stock must be present, in person or by proxy, at the special meeting to constitute a quorum? What if there is no quorum? 

A. 15,814,141 shares of our common stock must be present, in person or by proxy, at the special meeting to constitute a quorum. In the event that a quorum is not present at
the time the special meeting is to be convened, we may postpone the special meeting without a vote of our stockholders. 

Q. If my shares of common stock are held in street name, will the intermediary vote my shares of common stock for me? 

A. The intermediary will only be permitted to vote your shares of our common stock if you instruct the intermediary how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided
by the intermediary regarding the voting of your shares. Under NYSE rules, intermediaries that are members of NYSE and who hold shares for customers in street name
have the authority to vote in their discretion only on "routine" matters. On non-routine matters, an intermediary is permitted to vote shares held for customers in street
name only in accordance with the customers' instructions. Each of the Merger Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal is considered
a non-routine matter. As a result, if you are a beneficial owner and you do not provide the intermediary with voting instructions, your shares of our common stock will not
be voted, resulting in a "broker non-vote."

Q. What vote is required for our stockholders to approve the Merger Proposal? 

A. The adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock that are outstanding and entitled to
vote thereon.

Abstentions, broker non-votes, and shares not in attendance will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" approval of the Merger Proposal.

Q. What vote of our stockholders is required to approve the Merger Compensation Proposal? 

A. Approval of the Merger Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock that are present
at the special meeting, whether in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon as of the record date.

Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" approval of the Merger Compensation Proposal. Broker non-votes and shares not in attendance will have no
effect on the outcome of the vote on the Merger Compensation Proposal.

Q. What vote of our stockholders is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal? 

A. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock that are present at the
special meeting, whether in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon. A vote on the Adjournment Proposal does not require the presence of a quorum. The
Adjournment Proposal will be submitted to a vote at the special meeting only if the Board elects to do so.

Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" approval of the Adjournment Proposal. Broker non-votes and shares not in attendance will have no effect
on the outcome of the vote on the Adjournment Proposal.

Q. Are there any stockholders who have already committed to vote in favor of the Merger? 

A. Yes. Clark Estates, which held approximately 17.6% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of March 30, 2017, executed the Voting and Support Agreement
with Parent and Merger Sub, pursuant to which it agreed, among other things and subject to certain limitations, to vote the Stockholder Securities (as described under
"The Special Meeting—Voting and Support Agreement," on page 26) in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. See "The Special Meeting—Voting and Support Agreement," on page 26, for additional information. 

Q. How do I attend the meeting in person? 

A. If you hold your shares through an intermediary and you are planning to attend the meeting in person (regardless of whether you intend to vote your shares in person at
the meeting), you must send a written request for an admission ticket to our transfer agent, which our transfer agent must receive by May 24, 2017. Please note that if you
are a beneficial owner and wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you may not do so unless you first obtain a legal proxy from the intermediary. See "The Special
Meeting—Attending the Special Meeting in Person—Holders of Shares in Street Name and Legal Proxies," on page 29, for additional information.

You will not be admitted to the meeting unless you present an admission ticket and a valid form of government-issued photo identification. If you are a
stockholder of record, your admission ticket is attached to your proxy card.

Beneficial Owners.    If you hold shares in street name, the intermediary through which you hold such shares will provide you with a voting instruction form that will
explain how to direct the voting of your shares through the intermediary, which may include the ability to provide voting instructions via the Internet or by telephone.

Q. As a participant in the TRC Companies, Inc. 401(k) Retirement and Savings Plan (the "401(k) plan"), how do I vote the portion of my account that is allocated
to our common stock?

printed on the enclosed voting instruction form, in accordance with the directions provided. By filling out and returning the voting instruction form or transmitting voting
instructions via the Internet or by telephone, you will be providing the plan trustee with instructions on how to vote the shares of common stock allocated to your 401(k)
plan account. If you do not provide voting instructions for plan shares on a matter, the 401(k) plan trustee will vote your shares on that matter in the same proportion to
the voting instructions given by all other participants in the 401(k) plan. All votes by 401(k) plan participants must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 5,

If you hold our common stock through the 401(k) plan, you may revoke any prior proxy or voting instructions, regardless of how your proxy or voting instructions were
originally submitted, by:

• sending a written statement to that effect to our Corporate Secretary; 

• submitting a properly signed proxy card or voting instruction form dated a later date; or 

• submitting a later dated proxy or providing new voting instructions via the Internet or by telephone.

With respect to each of these revocation options for shares held through our 401(k) plan, the revocation must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 5, 2017
(three business days prior to the special meeting).

Q. If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of common stock voted? 

A. Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the proxy card will vote your shares of our common stock as you indicate. When casting your
vote by proxy card, by the Internet or by telephone, you may specify whether your shares of our common stock should be voted "FOR" or "AGAINST" each of the
Merger Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal, or whether such individuals should "ABSTAIN" from voting your shares of
common stock on any or all of the proposals.

If you own shares that are registered in your own name and return a signed proxy card or grant a proxy via the Internet or telephone, but do not indicate how you wish
your shares to be voted, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted "FOR" approval of the Merger Proposal, "FOR" approval of the Merger
Compensation Proposal, and, if submitted to a vote, "FOR" approval of the Adjournment Proposal.

If you own shares in street name, see "If my shares of common stock are held in street name, will the intermediary vote my shares of common stock for me?" for
additional information about voting of your shares if you do not provide instructions to the intermediary.

Q. What if I receive more than one proxy or set of voting instructions? 

A. If you received more than one proxy card, your shares are likely registered in different names, under different addresses or in multiple accounts. You must vote the shares
shown on each proxy card and comply with each set of voting instructions that you receive in order for all of your shares to be voted at the special meeting. 

Q. What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before the special meeting? 

A. The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is May 8, 2017, which is earlier than the date of the special meeting. If you sell or otherwise
transfer your shares after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person
to whom you transfer your shares and each of you notifies us in writing of such special arrangements, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the special meeting
but will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares. 

Q. What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the special meeting but before the Effective Time? 

A. If the Merger Proposal is approved by our stockholders and you sell or otherwise transfer your shares after the special meeting but before the Effective Time, you will

and expenses in connection with this proxy solicitation. In addition, our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the
Internet or in person, but they will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies. We may also reimburse intermediaries for their reasonable, out-of-pocket
expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of our common stock.

A. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, after carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, please vote promptly to ensure
that your shares are represented at the special meeting. 

Q. Should I send in my stock certificates now? 

A. No. If you hold a stock certificate representing our common stock, following the completion of the Merger, you will receive a letter of transmittal and other materials
describing how you may exchange your shares of common stock for the Merger Consideration. Please do NOT return your stock certificate(s) with your proxy card. 

Q. Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL instead of receiving the Merger Consideration for my shares of common stock? 

A. Yes. As a stockholder, you are entitled to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger if you take all of the actions required under the DGCL
to do so and meet certain conditions, including the requirement that you do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consent thereto in writing. See
"Appraisal Rights Under Delaware Law," beginning on page 87.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

        This proxy statement and the other documents referred to or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement contain or may contain "forward-looking statements" within
the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and are subject to the safe harbor created thereby under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as
"may," "might," "will," "should," "could," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "predict," "project," "future," "potential," "intend," "seek to," "plan," "assume," "believe," "target,"
"forecast," "goal," "objective," "continue" or the negative of such terms or other variations thereof or comparable terminology, and words and terms of similar substance used in
connection with any discussion of future plans, actions, or events identify forward-looking statements. Investors should consider statements that contain these words carefully
because they discuss our future expectations, contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition, or state other "forward-looking" information.
There may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control and that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in
our forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those
discussed as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to:

• certain risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed Merger, including: 

• the risk that the Merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect our business and the price of our common stock; 

• the failure to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders; 

• the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement; 

• the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed transactions on our business relationships, operating results, and business generally; 

• risks that the Merger disrupts our current plans and operations and potential difficulties in our employee retention as a result of the Merger; 

• risks related to diverting management's attention from our ongoing business operations, 

• the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us, our officers or directors related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger; 

• the possibility that competing offers or acquisition proposals for our business will be made; 

• the ability of Parent to implement its plans, forecasts, and other expectations with respect to our business after the completion of the Merger and realize
additional opportunities for growth and innovation; 

• the risk that the Merger Agreement may be terminated in circumstances that would require us to pay Parent the termination fee under the Merger
Agreement; 

• unanticipated changes in contract performance that may affect our profitability, particularly with contracts that are fixed-price or have funding limits; 

• seasonality of the spending cycle, notably for state and local government entities, and the spending patterns of our commercial sector clients; 

• budget constraints experienced by our federal, state and local government clients; 

• divestitures or discontinuance of operating units;

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        The Board has directed that this proxy statement be used to solicit proxies from our stockholders in connection with the special meeting.

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting 

        The special meeting of our stockholders will be held at The Bostonian Boston Hotel, located at 26 North Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, on June 8, 2017 at 2:00 p.m.,
Eastern time (the doors will open at 1:00 p.m., Eastern time).

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        The following table summarizes the proposals that will be brought for a vote of our stockholders at the special meeting, along with the voting recommendation of the Board
with regard to each proposal.

        The Board has unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and our stockholders and has approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. The
Board has unanimously directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to our stockholders for adoption. The Board unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote
"FOR" the Merger Proposal, "FOR" the Merger Compensation Proposal and "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal. See "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation
of the Board," "Merger Compensation Advisory Vote," and "Adjournment of the Special Meeting," beginning on pages 37, 85 and 86, respectively, for additional information.

        If you plan to attend the meeting in person, you must present an admission ticket and a valid form of government-issued photo identification. If you hold your
shares of our common stock through an intermediary and you are planning to attend the meeting in person, you must send a written request for an admission ticket to our
transfer agent, which our transfer agent must receive by May 24, 2017. For more information, see "The Special Meeting—Attending the Special Meeting in Person,"
beginning on page 28.

Record Date and Quorum 

        By authorization of the Board, we have fixed the close of business on May 8, 2017 as the record date for determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at,
the special meeting. Our common stock is our only class of voting security. Only our stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of,
and to vote at, the special meeting. We may retain

the same record date for any adjournments or any postponements of the special meeting that occur within 60 days after the record date. Each stockholder is entitled to one vote
for each share of our common stock held at the close of business on the record date. As of the record date for the special meeting, there were approximately 31,628,280 shares of
our common stock outstanding, which were held by approximately 233 stockholders of record.

        In order to constitute a quorum to conduct the special meeting, holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record
date must be present, either in person or by proxy, except that a quorum is not required for a vote on the Adjournment Proposal.

        Abstentions are included in the determination of shares present at the meeting for quorum purposes. An abstention will occur if a stockholder expressly directs the proxy
holder to abstain from voting or attends the special meeting in person and abstains from voting.

        A "broker non-vote" will occur when an intermediary holding shares in street name does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares on a matter
for which the intermediary lacks discretionary authority to vote because the matter is not considered routine. Each of the Merger Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal,
and the Adjournment Proposal is considered to be a non-routine matter. As a result, intermediaries will not be authorized to vote on these proposals unless they have received
specific voting instructions from the beneficial owners of our common stock. Because intermediaries will be unable to vote uninstructed shares at the special meeting, if you hold
your shares in street name and fail to provide voting instructions to your intermediary, your shares will not be counted as present for the purpose of establishing a quorum.

Stockholder Vote Required to Adopt Each Proposal 

        The table below summarizes the votes required for approval of each matter to be brought before the special meeting, as well as the treatment of abstentions and broker non-
votes:

        The vote to approve the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date, not only the shares
counted as present, in person or by proxy, at the special meeting. As a result, if you hold shares in street name and fail to provide voting instructions to your intermediary, it will
have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on the approval of the Merger Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.

Voting by Our Directors and Executive Officers 

        As of the record date for the special meeting, our directors and executive officers collectively had the right to vote 2,212,121 shares of our common stock, representing
approximately 7.0% of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.

        Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote their shares of our common stock for each of the proposals to be considered at the special
meeting, although none of them has entered into any agreement obligating them to do so.

Voting and Support Agreement 

        Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, Clark Estates, which held approximately 17.6% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of
March 30, 2017 (the "Stockholder Securities"), delivered to Parent and Merger Sub the Voting and Support Agreement. The form of the Voting and Support Agreement is
attached to the proxy statement as Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. Pursuant to the terms of the Voting and Support
Agreement, Clark Estates agreed, among other things, to vote the Stockholder Securities in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated thereby and against (i) any action or agreement that could reasonably be expected to prevent, delay, or adversely affect the Merger Agreement,
the Merger or the Voting and Support Agreement, (ii) any Competing Proposal (as described under "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals,"
beginning on page 71) and (iii) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty
or any other obligation or agreement of the Clark Estates under the Voting and Support Agreement, in each case subject to the limitations set forth in the Voting and Support
Agreement.

        Subject to certain exceptions, the Voting and Support Agreement prohibits transfers by Clark Estates of any of the Stockholder Securities prior to the termination of the
Voting and Support Agreement and certain other actions that would impair the ability of Clark Estates to fulfill its obligations under the Voting and Support Agreement.

        The Voting and Support Agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) termination of the Merger Agreement, (ii) the Effective Time, (iii) any change to the
Merger Agreement without the prior written consent of Clark Estates that reduces any consideration payable to Clark Estates or changes the form of consideration payable to
Clark Estates or otherwise materially amends the Merger Agreement in a manner adverse to Clark Estates relative to our other stockholders and (iv) the mutual consent of Parent
and Clark Estates.

Voting and Proxies 

        Providing a proxy means that a Company stockholder authorizes the persons named in the proxy to vote such stockholder's shares at the special meeting in the manner that
such stockholder directs. All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in the manner specified
by the stockholders giving those proxies.

How to Vote Shares Registered in Your Own Name

        If your shares are registered directly in your name with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, our transfer agent, you are considered a stockholder of record and you
may vote your shares of our common stock by proxy without attending the meeting in any of the following ways:

• Via our Internet Voting Site at www.voteproxy.com.  Follow the instructions for Internet voting printed on your proxy card.

Table of Contents

• By Telephone.  Call toll-free 1-800-776-9437. You can vote by telephone by following the instructions provided on the Internet voting site or by following the
instructions provided on your proxy card. 

• By Mail.  You can vote by completing, signing, dating and returning the proxy card in the accompanying postage-paid envelope.

        If you are a stockholder of record, you may also attend the special meeting and vote in person, provided that you comply with all of the admission procedures.

        The Internet and telephone voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 7, 2017.

        Your signed proxy card or the proxy you grant via the Internet or by telephone will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If you are a stockholder of record and
return a signed proxy card or grant a proxy via the Internet or by telephone, but do not indicate how you wish your shares to be voted, your shares will be voted "FOR" each of
the Merger Proposal, the Merger Compensation Proposal, and, if submitted to a vote, the Adjournment Proposal. In the absence of instructions to the contrary, proxies will be
voted in accordance with the discretion of the person(s) exercising the proxy on any other matter properly submitted to the vote of the stockholders at the special meeting.

        If you received more than one proxy card, your shares are likely registered in different names or with different addresses. You must separately vote the shares shown on each
proxy card that you receive in order for all of your shares to be voted at the meeting.

How to Vote Shares Held in Street Name

        If you hold shares in street name through an intermediary, you will not receive a proxy card. Rather, you will receive from your intermediary a voting instruction form that
will explain how to direct the voting of your shares through the intermediary, which may include the ability to provide voting instructions via the Internet or by telephone.

        If your shares are held in street name through an intermediary, and you wish to vote on any of the proposals to be submitted to a vote at the special meeting, you must
indicate in the voting instruction form provided by your intermediary how you wish your shares to be voted. The broker will vote shares held by you in street name in accordance
with your voting instructions, as indicated on your signed voting instruction form or by the instructions you provide via the Internet or by telephone. Absent such instructions, the
proxy submitted by the broker with respect to your shares will indicate that it is a broker non-vote with respect to those shares. A broker non-vote with respect to each proposal
will have the effect set forth under "The Special Meeting—Stockholder Vote Required to Adopt Each Proposal" on page 25. Accordingly, if your shares are held in street
name, it is important that you provide voting instructions to the intermediary so that your vote will be counted.

        If you hold shares in street name and wish to vote your shares in person at the special meeting, you must first obtain a valid legal proxy from the intermediary. To attend the
meeting in person (regardless of whether you intend to vote your shares in person at the meeting), you must obtain an admission ticket in advance of the meeting by
following the instructions under "The Special Meeting—Attending the Special Meeting in Person," beginning on page 28.

        If you received more than one voting instruction form, your shares are likely registered in different names or with different addresses or are held in multiple accounts. You
must separately follow the foregoing voting procedures for each voting instruction form that you receive in order for all of your shares to be voted at the special meeting.

        The Internet and telephone voting facilities for shares held in street name will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 7, 2017.

Shares Held Through the 401(k) Plan

        You may direct the voting of the number of shares of our common stock allocated to your 401(k) plan account, which number is printed on the enclosed voting instruction
form, in accordance with the directions provided. By completing, dating, signing and returning the voting instruction form or transmitting voting instructions via the Internet or
by telephone, you will be providing the plan trustee with instructions on how to vote the shares of our common stock allocated to your 401(k) plan account. If you do not provide
voting instructions for plan shares on a matter, the 401(k) plan trustee will vote your shares on that matter in the same proportion to the voting instructions given by all other
participants in the 401(k) plan.

        The Internet and telephone voting facilities for participants in the 401(k) plan will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 5, 2017 (three business days prior to the special
meeting).

Revocation of Proxies 

        If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke any prior proxy or voting instructions, regardless of how your proxy or voting instructions were originally submitted, by:

• sending a written statement to that effect to our Corporate Secretary, which we must receive before the special meeting; 

• submitting a properly signed proxy card or voting instruction form dated a later date; 

• submitting a later dated proxy or providing new voting instructions via the Internet or by telephone; or 

• attending the special meeting in person and voting your shares.

        If you hold shares in street name, you should follow the instructions provided on your voting instruction form or contact the intermediary for instructions on how to change
your vote.

        If you hold our common stock through our 401(k) plan, you may revoke any prior proxy or voting instructions, regardless of how your proxy or voting instructions were
originally submitted, by:

• sending a written statement to that effect to our Corporate Secretary; 

• submitting a properly signed proxy card or voting instruction form dated a later date; or 

• submitting a later dated proxy or providing new voting instructions via the Internet or by telephone.

        With respect to each of these revocation options for shares held through our 401(k) plan, the revocation must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 5, 2017 (three
business days prior to the special meeting).

Attending the Special Meeting in Person 

Admission Procedures

        If you plan to attend the meeting in person, you must have an admission ticket, along with a valid, government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's

        Stockholders of record and persons whose shares are held through an intermediary, each as of the record date, or their legal proxies, are the only persons eligible to receive
admission tickets.

        Please note that seating is limited. Requests for admission tickets will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. These requests will be processed by our transfer agent
in the order in which they are received and must be received by our transfer agent no later than May 24, 2017. For further information on how to contact our transfer agent, see

contact our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, to request a replacement.

Holders of Shares in Street Name and Legal Proxies

        If you hold your shares in street name or you hold a valid legal proxy and you plan to attend the meeting in person, you must send a written request for an admission ticket
to our transfer agent. Please include the following information with your request:

• A signed cover letter stating: 

• your name and complete mailing address, including daytime and evening telephone numbers; 

• that you are requesting an admission ticket; 

• the number of shares that you own in street name or that are the subject of the legal proxy; and 

• the name, address and telephone number of the intermediary, or the stockholder who gave the legal proxy, if applicable. 

• An originally signed letter from the intermediary holding your shares (or, in the case of a legal proxy, the shares owned by the stockholder who gave the legal
proxy) verifying your beneficial ownership of common stock as of the record date. A copy or printout of a brokerage statement (including any statement
retrieved through the Internet) WILL NOT be sufficient without an originally signed letter from your intermediary. 

• If you are a holder of a valid legal proxy, a copy of the proxy, which must be properly executed, notarized and dated. 

• A copy of your valid, government-issued photo identification.

Solicitation Costs 

        We will bear the costs of solicitation of proxies. We have engaged D.F. King to assist in the solicitation of these proxies and will pay D.F. King an estimated fee of $12,000
and telephone charges for these solicitation services. We have agreed to reimburse D.F. King for, or pay directly, certain fees and expenses and will also indemnify D.F. King
against certain claims, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses in connection with this proxy solicitation.

Table of Contents

        In addition to the use of the mails, our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies personally, by telephone or facsimile or via the Internet. These individuals will
not receive any additional compensation for these activities.

        Arrangements may also be made with intermediaries to forward solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of shares held of record by such persons, and we will
reimburse intermediaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection therewith. The extent to which these proxy-soliciting efforts will be necessary
depends upon how promptly proxies are submitted.

Postponement or Adjournment 

        In the event that a quorum is not present at the time the special meeting is to be convened, we may postpone the special meeting without a vote of our stockholders.

        Although it is not currently expected, if we convene the special meeting and there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement, we may adjourn the special meeting
for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If the special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their
proxies may revoke them at any time prior to their use. See "Adjournment of the Special Meeting" on page 86.

        In addition, under the Merger Agreement, we may adjourn or postpone the special meeting to the extent required in order to provide our stockholders with any required
supplement or amendment to this proxy statement within a reasonable amount of time in advance, or otherwise with Parent's written consent.

        If we adjourn or postpone the special meeting and such adjournment or postponement is for more than 30 days or, if after the adjournment or postponement, a new record
date is fixed for the adjourned or postponed meeting, notice of the adjourned or postponed meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting in
accordance with the DGCL.

Stockholder List 

        A list of our stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for examination by any of our stockholders at the special meeting. At least 10 days prior to
the date of the special meeting for any purpose germane to the meeting, this stockholder list will be available for inspection by our stockholders, subject to compliance with the
applicable provisions of Delaware law, during ordinary business hours at our corporate offices located at 21 Griffin Road North, Windsor, Connecticut 06095.

Exchange of Stock Certificates 

        Our stockholders should not send any stock certificates representing our common stock with their proxies. If the Merger is consummated, separate transmittal documents for
the surrender of stock certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration will be mailed to registered holders promptly following the Effective Time, and in any event no later
than two business days thereafter. PLEASE DO NOT RETURN YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) WITH YOUR PROXY CARD. See "The Merger—Payment of Merger
Consideration and Surrender of Shares," beginning on page 59, for additional information.

THE MERGER 

        This discussion of the Merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. You should read the
entire Merger Agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the Merger.

        The Merger Agreement provides that, upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company
surviving the Merger. You will not own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Merger Consideration 

        In the Merger, each outstanding share of our common stock (other than shares that we, Parent or Merger Sub own and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to $17.55 per share, without interest and less any applicable tax withholding.

Background of the Merger 

        The Board and our senior management regularly review and assess our long-term business plan and strategic alternatives available to us to enhance stockholder value,
including potential business combination transactions and, from time to time, members of our senior management meet with senior management of other participants in the
engineering and construction services industry to discuss industry developments and trends. Following the completion of our 2016 fiscal year on June 30, 2016, we developed a
five-year strategic plan for fiscal years 2017 through 2021, focused on organic growth and growth from our pending and contemplated acquisitions. The five-year strategic plan
that we developed for fiscal years 2017-2021 did not include seeking an acquisition partner for the Company.

        In the spring of 2016, Mr. Vincze and James B. Stephenson, our Chief Strategy Officer, were approached by the head of corporate development of a large international
engineering firm ("Bidder A") with a general inquiry about a potential business combination. This inquiry led to an initial meeting in July 2016, among Mr. Vincze and the chief
executive officer of Bidder A in Boston. No specific terms of a potential business combination transaction were proposed or discussed at this meeting. Mr. Vincze advised Bidder
A that we were not for sale at that time and not interested in pursuing a business combination transaction. As no specific terms had been offered at that point by Bidder A and as
we were not considering a sale of the Company, the Board did not meet at that point to discuss any potential transaction proposed by Bidder A.

        Messrs. Vincze and Stephenson attended the Environmental Financial Consulting Group ("EFCG") conference held in New York City between October 19 and 21, 2016.
Several members of the management team of Bidder A also attended the EFCG conference, including its head of corporate development. At a meeting between Mr. Vincze and
representatives of Bidder A, representatives of Bidder A once again raised the possibility of a business combination with the Company, but no specific terms of a potential
business combination transaction were proposed or discussed at this time.

        Between October and December 2016, the chief executive officer of Bidder A contacted Mr. Vincze a number of times to further discuss a potential transaction with the
Company, but without offering any specific terms.

        On December 8, 2016, Mr. Vincze met with the chief executive officer of Bidder A in Boston, who told Mr. Vincze he wished to provide a letter of intent to the Company
outlining the terms of a transaction to acquire all of our outstanding stock for $13.00 per share. Mr. Vincze advised the chief executive officer of Bidder A of his view that the
offered price was not likely to be considered adequate by the Board. On December 13, 2016, Bidder A provided Mr. Vincze with a letter of intent offering to purchase all of our
outstanding stock for $14.00 per share. The letter was non-binding, subject to a financing contingency and to completion of due diligence, and requested that we grant

exclusivity to negotiate a transaction with Bidder A during the period required to complete such due diligence.

        On December 14, 2016, in response to the December 13, 2016 letter of intent provided by Bidder A, the Board held a telephonic meeting at which all of our directors were
present, as well as, at the invitation of the Board, Martin H. Dodd, our General Counsel and Secretary, and representatives of Houlihan Lokey and of the law firm Covington &
Burling LLP ("Covington"). At this meeting, the Board decided to undertake a process to evaluate Bidder A's offer and to explore a potential sale or other transaction involving
the Company, and authorized our management to retain Houlihan Lokey as our financial advisor in connection with a potential business combination transaction. The Board
selected Houlihan Lokey due to its familiarity with the Company, experience advising companies in the engineering and consulting industries, and experience advising
companies in connection with mergers and acquisitions. The Board decided to retain Covington as its legal advisor, given Covington's longstanding relationship with the
Company and prominence in merger and acquisition transactions. In the interests of efficiency and convenience, and to permit members of senior management to interact with
representative members of the Board on an expedited basis, the Board also established a special committee (the "Special Committee") to oversee any valuation assessment
process, interface with our management and advisors and keep the Board informed on progress thereof. The Special Committee members were directors John A. Carrig (Chair of
the Special Committee), F. Thomas Casey, Richard H. Grogan and B. Keith Trent. The Board instructed the Company's legal and financial advisors to assist the Special
Committee in connection with the sale process.

        Also at the December 14, 2016 meeting, representatives of Covington explained the duties of our directors under Delaware law in the context of a potential business
combination transaction. After discussion, including a discussion of balancing the need to preserve confidentiality, competitive concerns and fundamental value, the Board
decided that it would be appropriate to contact other potential interested parties on a confidential basis to seek additional proposals for a business combination or other
transaction involving the Company. Representatives of Houlihan Lokey reviewed and discussed with the Board possible ways it could respond to and seek to improve the Bidder
A offer and create a process to develop meaningful alternatives. The Board instructed Houlihan Lokey to assist the Company's management in connection with the proposed
process and to work with our senior management to develop a list of potential buyers which the Board could authorize our senior management to approach regarding a potential
transaction.

        In the second half of December 2016, Houlihan Lokey assisted our senior management in developing a list of potential buyers, which initially included 25 potential financial
buyers believed to be potentially interested in an investment in the engineering and construction services industry and believed to be potentially interested and capable of
consummating transactions having an enterprise value in excess of $500 million, and five potential strategic buyers in the engineering and construction services industry believed
to be potentially interested in and capable of acquiring the Company.

        At a meeting of the Special Committee on January 9, 2017, which, at the request of the Board, was also attended by Messrs. Vincze, Dodd and Stephenson, and by
representatives of Houlihan Lokey, the Special Committee received an update from management and Houlihan Lokey regarding the steps being taken with respect to the sale
process, and also discussed the list of potential buyers prepared with the assistance of Houlihan Lokey. The Special Committee considered the potential risks of disclosure of
sensitive Company information to competitors, general concerns regarding preserving confidentiality, and discussed with Houlihan Lokey the values potential financial buyers
and strategic buyers might ascribe to the Company. The Special Committee decided that it would be appropriate to approach the identified potential financial buyers first, prior to
approaching the identified potential strategic buyers.

        During the first half of January 2017, at the request of the Board, Houlihan Lokey contacted 22 of the 25 identified potential financial buyers believed most likely to be
interested in acquiring the Company to solicit their interest in receiving information about a potential acquisition opportunity. During that same period, our senior management,
with the assistance of representatives of Houlihan Lokey, prepared informational materials that could be provided to prospective buyers. We also established a virtual data room
and began to populate it with documents and information about our business in order to permit potential buyers to conduct due diligence.

        During January 2017, 21 of the 22 potential financial buyers approached by Houlihan Lokey at the direction of the Board expressed interest in discussing a potential
transaction and entered into non-disclosure and standstill agreements with the Company, which included customary standstill provisions (except that such provisions may have
included an exception to the extent necessary to allow such person to make a confidential proposal to the Company or to the Board). These potential buyers were provided with
some introductory information regarding the Company, including an executive summary and certain "base case" and "acquisition case" financial projections that we developed
based on our five-year strategic plan for fiscal years 2017-2021, and a variety of publicly available materials such as annual and quarterly SEC filings, investor presentations and
analyst reports.

        In early January, Bidder A entered into a non-disclosure and standstill agreement with us, following which Bidder A was granted access to the virtual data room on
January 11, 2017. Over the following weeks, representatives of Bidder A engaged in a review of information regarding the Company, including several in-person due diligence
meetings with our representatives.

        In late January 2017 and early February 2017, 16 of the 21 potential financial buyers that had signed non-disclosure and standstill agreements with us participated in
meetings with Messrs. Vincze and Stephenson to receive an introductory presentation regarding the Company.

        Each of the potential financial buyers was requested to submit, on February 6, 2017, an initial indication of its interest in an acquisition of the Company, including an
indicated range of the enterprise value it would ascribe to the Company.

        At a meeting of the Special Committee on January 23, 2017, which was attended by Messrs. Dodd and Stephenson and which, at the request of the Board, was also attended
by representatives of Houlihan Lokey, the Special Committee reviewed the status of the process to-date and considered the feasibility of conducting the due diligence process for
multiple bidders at the same time and the risk of disclosure of sensitive Company information to competitors. Representatives of Houlihan Lokey also reviewed and discussed
certain preliminary financial analyses with respect to the Company and a potential transaction. After reviewing and discussing the foregoing with the assistance of Mr. Dodd and
our financial advisors and considering, among other things, the potential risks of disclosure of sensitive Company information to a competitor, and the opportunity to build a
potential platform that could be derived by a financial buyer by acquiring the Company, the Special Committee determined to defer approaching the five previously identified
potential strategic buyers until after reviewing the initial indications of interest to be received on February 6, 2017 from the potential financial buyers already contacted.

        On February 6, 2017, six of the potential financial buyers, including NMC, presented preliminary indications of interest. The table below presents the ranges of enterprise
values and corresponding implied prices per share reflected by the indications of interest received (in addition, for comparison

purposes, to the price per share that had been offered by Bidder A in December 2016 and the corresponding enterprise value derived from that price):

        Each of the potential financial buyers, including NMC, that submitted a preliminary indication of interest, other than Bidder B, was provided with access to the virtual data
room on February 10, 2017.

        On February 13, 2017, the Special Committee met to review the preliminary indications of interest. Messrs. Vincze and Dodd were present and, at the request of the Board,
representatives of Houlihan Lokey also attended the meeting. Following a review of the seven preliminary indications of interest received and discussion with the assistance of
Houlihan Lokey, the Special Committee determined that the range of value offered by Bidder B was not competitive enough and directed Houlihan Lokey to advise Bidder B that
it would not be invited to continue in the process.

        Bidder A, Bidder C, Bidder D, Bidder E, Bidder F and NMC continued their due diligence review of the Company, including review of the materials in the virtual data room
and meetings with our representatives. Each bidder remaining in the process was instructed to provide an updated indication of interest to us by February 27, 2017.

        On February 24, 2017, each of Bidder A, Bidder E and Bidder F advised Houlihan Lokey that it was no longer interested in pursuing a potential transaction with the
Company.

        During the month of February 2017, Covington prepared an initial draft of a merger agreement providing for a potential transaction. Early in the week of February 20, 2017,
the draft form of merger agreement was distributed to the members of the Special Committee for their review and comment. On February 24, 2017, we made available to each
potential buyer remaining in the process an initial draft merger agreement for a proposed acquisition of the Company.

        On February 27, 2017, NMC, Bidder C and Bidder D submitted updated indications of interest. In addition, Bidder C submitted preliminary comments on the draft merger
agreement. The table below presents the ranges of enterprise values and corresponding implied prices per share reflected by the revised indications of interest received:

        On February 28, 2017, the Board held a meeting in Tampa, Florida, which, at the request of the Board, was also attended by members of management and representatives of
Houlihan Lokey and Covington. The representatives of Houlihan Lokey summarized the sale process to date, including the three revised bids received the day before, and
reviewed and discussed its preliminary financial analyses with respect to the Company and the three revised bids. Covington again provided the directors with an overview of
their fiduciary duties under Delaware law with respect to a potential transaction, and reviewed the proposed terms of the draft merger agreement provided to bidders. Following
discussion,

the Board decided we should continue to engage in discussions with all three remaining bidders with an aim of trying to maximize the value offered to our stockholders in a
potential transaction, and directed Houlihan Lokey to request each bidder to submit a best and final offer on or about March 24, 2017. After discussion with the assistance of
Houlihan Lokey, the Board decided that, in light of the potential premium indications received to date and the Board's belief that there was a low likelihood of a higher bid from a
potential strategic buyer, weighed against the risk of harm, competitive or otherwise, to the Company, of approaching potential strategic buyers in the process, it was not in the
best interests of our stockholders to contact potential strategic buyers at that stage of the process. In addition, the Board directed Houlihan Lokey to request each bidder to submit
a complete markup of the draft merger agreement during the week of March 13, 2017, in advance of submitting final offers.

        During the first three weeks of March 2017, all three bidders continued their due diligence review of the Company, held multiple calls with our senior management and
representatives, and submitted numerous requests for additional information and documents, which we worked to supply. Also during this period, each of the three bidders met in
person for one- or two-day due diligence meetings with our senior management in Boston. In addition, during this period, Covington engaged in discussions with counsel for
each of the bidders regarding the draft merger agreement and exchanged drafts of the merger agreement with such counsel.

        In advance of the deadline for submission of final bids, at the request of the Board, Houlihan Lokey encouraged each of the bidders to consider strengthening its
commitment to provide the required funds to complete the transaction. Specifically, each bidder was encouraged to provide a "full equity backstop" from its fund of the full
purchase price in order to enhance the certainty of completion of a transaction. In addition, during the week of March 20, 2017, in response to a request made by Bidder C during
that week to extend the deadline for submitting final bids, Houlihan Lokey was directed by the Board to inform each bidder that the bid deadline would be extended to March 27,
2017.

        On March 24, 2017, Kirkland & Ellis LLP ("K&E"), counsel for NMC, submitted a proposed markup of the draft merger agreement. The draft merger agreement submitted
by NMC did not include a financing condition and incorporated an equity commitment from the Equity Investor to the acquisition vehicle for the full amount of the aggregate
merger consideration, and a fund guarantee. K&E also provided drafts of NMC's proposed equity commitment letter, debt commitment letter and guarantee, and a draft of the
form of voting and support agreement.

        Late in the day on March 27, 2017, each of the three bidders submitted the financial terms of its bid. In the case of Bidders C and D, the proposed drafts of the merger
agreement, equity and debt commitment letters, guarantees, and other ancillary agreements (including in each case a voting and support agreement) followed on March 28, 2017.
Each bidder indicated that prior to execution of a definitive merger agreement, it would expect an opportunity to meet with our senior management for preliminary discussions
regarding potential post-closing employment arrangements. The draft merger agreements submitted by Bidder C and Bidder D did not include a financing condition, but did
provide for a "leveraged buyout model" of transaction in which the financial sponsor's equity commitment to the acquisition vehicle and related fund guarantee would be for only
a portion of the anticipated purchase price, and the draft merger agreement incorporated certain important limitations on the exposure of the financial sponsor in the event the
transaction was not completed: in particular, in the event that the debt financing contemplated by the debt financing commitments of the respective potential buyer became
unavailable, the exposure of the financial sponsor would be limited to payment to us of a reverse termination fee of less than 10% of the aggregate merger consideration.

        The table below presents the price per share offered by each bidder in its final bid:

        On March 28, 2017, the Board met via telephone to discuss the final bids submitted by the three bidders. Also in attendance at the request of the Board were Mr. Dodd and
representatives of Houlihan Lokey and of Covington. At that meeting, representatives of Houlihan Lokey reviewed and discussed the final bids from the three potential buyers
remaining in the process. While NMC and Bidder D had indicated that they had substantially completed their due diligence, Bidder C indicated that it had not yet completed its
diligence. Following discussion, the Board unanimously agreed that the NMC offer was superior to the other proposals both on price and its markup of the draft merger
agreement. Accordingly, the Board instructed our management and its advisors to continue to negotiate a transaction with NMC at that point, with an aim to signing the merger
agreement by March 30, 2017. In addition, the Board authorized Mr. Vincze to engage in preliminary discussions with representatives of NMC regarding potential post-closing
employment arrangements for our senior management.

        Following such instructions, Covington revised the draft of the merger agreement and provided a further mark-up to K&E in the evening of March 28, 2017. Over the next
two days, Covington and K&E continued negotiations of the merger agreement, the form of voting and support agreement, and other ancillary documents, and exchanged
successive drafts of the documents.

        The Board convened for a telephonic meeting on March 30, 2017, after the U.S. stock markets closed. Also in attendance were Mr. Dodd and representatives of Houlihan
Lokey and Covington. At the meeting, Covington reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties in the context of the proposed Merger. Covington then summarized the material
terms of the proposed form of merger agreement. Mr. Vincze then described for the Board his preliminary discussions with representatives of NMC about the proposed approach
to post-closing employment arrangements and incentives for senior management. At the request of the Board, Houlihan Lokey then reviewed and discussed its financial analyses
with respect to the Company and the proposed Merger, as more fully described under "The Merger—Opinion of Houlihan Lokey—Summary of Material Financial Analyses."
Thereafter, at the request of the Board, Houlihan Lokey verbally rendered its opinion to the Board (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Houlihan Lokey's
written opinion addressed to the Board dated March 30, 2017), as to, as of such date, the fairness, from a financial point of view, to our stockholders, of the Merger Consideration
to be received by such holders in the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The full text of the written opinion of Houlihan Lokey, which describes, among
other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, other matters considered and limit of review by Houlihan Lokey, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement.

        At the March 30, 2017 meeting, following discussion and after consultation with Messrs. Vincze and Dodd and the representatives of Houlihan Lokey and Covington, the
Board unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, were advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of,
the Company and our stockholders, approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in
accordance with the DGCL, resolved to recommend that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, and took such actions as were necessary to render Section 203 of the
DGCL inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Voting and Support Agreement. The Board also authorized our executive officers to, in
accordance with the Merger Agreement, call a special meeting of our stockholders to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and to establish a time and place for such
special meeting and a record date for those stockholders entitled to notice of a vote at such special meeting.

        Later in the evening on March 30, 2017, the Merger Agreement, the Voting and Support Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Guarantee were executed, and
we announced execution of the Merger Agreement before the U.S. stock markets opened on the morning of March 31, 2017.

Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board 

Reasons for the Merger

        At a meeting held on March 30, 2017, the Board unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby are
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and our stockholders, and approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Board resolved to recommend that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.

        In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, the Board consulted with our management and its outside legal and
financial advisors. In the course of reaching its determination that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby were advisable and fair to,
and in the best interests of, the Company and our stockholders, and to recommend that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, the Board considered numerous factors and
benefits of the Merger, each of which the Board believed supported its unanimous determination and recommendation. As a result, for the reasons set forth below, the Board
recommends that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, voting "FOR" the Merger Proposal:

• Merger Consideration.  The Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration represents: 

• a premium of approximately 46.9% to the closing price of our common stock on March 30, 2017, which was the last full trading day before the Board
approved the Merger Agreement, representing approximately $177.1 million of aggregate value to our stockholders; 

• a premium of approximately 62.0% to the average closing price of our common stock for the trading days during the 30-day period that ended on
March 30, 2017; 

• a premium of approximately 64.9% to the average closing price of our common stock for the trading days during the 90-day period that ended on
March 30, 2017; 

• a premium of approximately 106.2% to the average closing price of our common stock for the trading days during the 365-day period that ended on
March 30, 2017; and 

• the Board's belief that it had obtained Parent's best and final offer, and that, as of the date of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Consideration represented
the highest per share consideration reasonably obtainable. 

• Company's Operating and Financial Condition; Prospects of the Company.  The Board considered that the Merger Consideration of $17.55 per share to be
received by our stockholders provides greater certainty of value (and less risk) to our stockholders relative to the potential trading price of our common stock over
a longer period after accounting for the long-term risks to our business resulting from operational execution risk and evolving industry dynamics. 

• Strategic Process; Parent's Bid was the Highest.  The Board considered its belief that the value offered to our stockholders in the Merger was more favorable to
our stockholders than the potential value of remaining an independent public company and that the Merger Consideration obtained was the highest that was
reasonably attainable. The Board also considered the process through which we, with the assistance of our financial advisor, engaged in discussions with other
interested parties believed to be the most likely candidates to pursue an acquisition of the

Company over the course of approximately three months, including by approaching 23 parties, executing confidentiality agreements with 22 of them, conducting
meetings between management and 17 of those parties, receiving initial indications of interest from seven of them and updated bids from three of them, and then
ultimately receiving final bids from those same three parties, of which Parent's bid was the highest, at $17.55, while the final bids of the two other parties were for
a price per share of $14.75 and $13.50, respectively.

• Increase in Share Price.  The Board considered that the Merger Consideration of $17.55 per share was significantly higher than the implied price per share range
of $14.30 - $15.78 in the initial indication of interest provided by Parent's affiliate NMC in February 2017, and also significantly higher than the implied price per
share range provided by all other six parties that provided initial indications of interest, which together had an implied share price ranging from $13.74 - $16.82. 

• Cash Consideration; Certainty of Value.  The Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration will be paid in cash, providing certainty, immediate value
and liquidity to our stockholders. 

• No Financing Condition and Full Equity Backstop.  The Board considered the fact that (i) the Merger is not subject to a financing condition, and that the Equity
Investor committed to fund Parent with up to $665.0 million, which, together with our cash on hand at closing, is expected to be sufficient to cover the aggregate
amounts required to pay the Merger Consideration, the amounts payable to holders of Company Equity Awards, the repayment of outstanding indebtedness under
the Credit Agreement and payment of fees required to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and (ii) we are entitled, under certain circumstances, to seek
specific performance to cause Parent to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity Commitment Letter in connection with the consummation of the Merger. 

• Financial Analysis of the Company's Financial Advisor and Related Opinion.  The Board considered the financial analyses reviewed by Houlihan Lokey with the
Board, as well as the oral opinion of Houlihan Lokey rendered to the Board, on March 30, 2017 (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of
Houlihan Lokey's written opinion addressed to the Board dated March 30, 2017), as to, as of such date, the fairness, from a financial point of view, to our
stockholders, of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement. 

• Negotiations with Parent.  The Board considered the benefits that we and our advisors were able to obtain during our negotiations with Parent and that the Merger
Agreement was the product of arm's-length negotiations, and contained terms and conditions that were, in the Board's view, advisable and favorable to us and our
stockholders. 

• The Merger Agreement.  The Board considered the provisions of the Merger Agreement, including: 

• the agreed exclusions of certain events and conditions from the definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect"; 

• our ability under certain circumstances to entertain unsolicited proposals for an acquisition that would reasonably be expected to lead to a "superior
proposal"; 

• the ability of the Board under certain circumstances to withdraw or modify its recommendation that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement,

• our and Parent's respective termination rights, including our right to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances in order to accept a
"superior proposal" and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such "superior proposal"; 

• the termination fee payable by us under certain circumstances, which the Board believed was reasonable relative to termination fees in transactions of a
similar size and determined was unlikely to become payable unless the Board entered into a definitive agreement providing for a "superior proposal"; 

• the representations and warranties of the Company, which the Board considered reasonable for a transaction of this nature, and which were in several cases
qualified by "Company Material Adverse Effect" and by disclosures made in our SEC filings, and in other cases by knowledge or materiality, or by
reference to certain limited time periods; 

• the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub; 

• the covenants and agreements of the parties; and 

• the conditions to closing of the Merger. 

• Timing of Completion.  The Board considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the
structure of the transaction as an all-cash merger, which should, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, allow our stockholders to
receive the Merger Consideration in a relatively short timeframe. The Board considered that the potential for closing in a relatively short timeframe could also
reduce the amount of time in which our business would be subject to the potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption. 

• Appraisal Rights.  The Board considered the availability of statutory appraisal rights to our stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement (or consent thereto in writing) and otherwise comply with all required procedures under the DGCL. 

• Stockholders' Ability to Reject the Merger.  The Board considered the fact that the Merger is subject to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon at the close of business on the record date. 

• Voting and Support Agreement.  The Board considered the fact that the Voting and Support Agreement with Clark Estates terminates in the event that the Merger
Agreement is terminated, which would permit Clark Estates to support a transaction involving a "superior proposal."

        The Board also considered a variety of risks and uncertainties and other potentially negative factors in its evaluation of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, including, but
not limited to, the following:

• Delays in or Failure to Complete Merger.  The Merger may be delayed or not be completed, resulting in loss of value to our stockholders and negative impact on
our financial position, operations and prospects. 

• Lack of Ongoing Equity Participation for Our Stockholders.  Our stockholders will have no ongoing equity participation in the Company or Parent following the
Merger, and our stockholders will cease to participate in our future earnings or growth, if any, and will not benefit from increases, if any, in the value of the
Surviving Corporation's common stock following the Merger. 

• Substantial Costs of Merger.  There have been and will continue to be significant costs involved in connection with negotiating the Merger Agreement and
completing the Merger (certain of which we will be required to bear), including in connection with the pursuit of regulatory approval and

in connection with litigation that could arise in the future in connection with the Merger. In addition, substantial management time and effort have been and will
continue to be required to effectuate the Merger, which could result in disruption of our day-to-day operations during the pendency of the Merger.

• Disruption of Business and Other Relationships.  If the Merger is not consummated, the pendency of the Merger could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries'
relationships with (i) our and their respective customers, employees, suppliers, agents and others with whom we and they have business dealings and
(ii) governmental entities. 

• Restrictions on Our Operations.  The terms of the Merger Agreement place restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Merger, which
may delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that may arise prior to completion of the Merger. 

• Taxable Transaction for Stockholders.  The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes for many of our stockholders. 

• Interest of Our Directors and Executive Officers.  Our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to,
the interests of our stockholders, including (i) the expectation that certain of our executive officers may enter into agreements with Parent or Merger Sub regarding
employment with the Surviving Corporation or regarding the right to purchase or participate in the equity of the Surviving Corporation prior to or following the
closing of the Merger, (ii) the accelerated vesting and cash-out of Company Equity Awards held by executive officers and directors, (iii) the obligation to pay
transaction or completion bonuses to certain of our executive officers following the completion of the Merger, (iv) our obligation to make cash payments to
Mr. Vincze and provide Mr. Vincze with benefit continuation for up to two years following his termination (or a cash payment in lieu thereof) if we terminate his
employment for any reason other than death, disability or cause, or he terminates his employment with us for good reason, (v) the payment of cash severance and
certain other benefits to our executive officers other than Mr. Vincze and Mr. Bennet if their employment terminates under specified circumstances during
specified periods before and after consummation of the Merger, and (vi) continued indemnification and insurance coverage for our directors and executive officers
from the Surviving Corporation and Parent under the terms of the Merger Agreement. 

• Termination Fee.  The Board considered the possibility that a termination fee may be due to Parent in certain circumstances where the Merger Agreement is
terminated.

        After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Board concluded that the risks, uncertainties, and other potentially negative factors
associated with the Merger were outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger to us and our stockholders. Accordingly, the Board determined that the Merger Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and our stockholders.

        The foregoing discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the information and factors considered by the Board in its consideration of the Merger, but is merely a
summary of the material positive factors and material negative factors considered by the Board in that regard. In view of the number and variety of factors and the amount of
information considered, the Board did not find it practicable to make specific assessments of, quantify, or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in
reaching its determination. In addition, the Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular
factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination, and individual members of the Board may have given different weights to different factors. Based on the
totality of the information presented, the Board collectively reached the unanimous

factors that the Board felt were appropriate. The above explanation of the reasons for the Merger and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature

Recommendation of the Board

        THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE MERGER PROPOSAL.

Opinion of Houlihan Lokey 

Summary of Opinion

        On March 30, 2017, Houlihan Lokey verbally rendered its opinion to the Board (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Houlihan Lokey's written
opinion addressed to the Board dated March 30, 2017), as to, as of such date, the fairness, from a financial point of view, to our stockholders, of the Merger Consideration to be
received by such holders in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

        Houlihan Lokey's opinion was directed to the Board (in its capacity as such) and only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, to our stockholders, of
the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and did not address any other aspect or implication of the
Merger, any related transaction or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection therewith or otherwise. This summary of Houlihan
Lokey's opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of its written opinion, which is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and describes the
procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken and other matters considered by Houlihan Lokey in connection with
the preparation of its opinion. However, neither Houlihan Lokey's opinion nor the summary of its opinion and the related analyses set forth in this proxy statement are
intended to be, and do not constitute, advice or a recommendation to the Board, the Company, any of our security holders or any other person as to how to act or vote
with respect to any matter relating to the Merger or otherwise.

        In arriving at its opinion, Houlihan Lokey, among other things:

        1.     reviewed a draft, dated March 29, 2017, of the merger agreement;

        2.     reviewed certain of our publicly available business and financial information that Houlihan Lokey deemed to be relevant;

        3.     reviewed certain information relating to our historical, current and future operations, financial condition and prospects that we made available to Houlihan
Lokey, including financial projections (and adjustments thereto) prepared by our management relating to the Company;

        4.     spoke with certain members of our management and certain of our representatives and advisors regarding our business, operations, financial condition and
prospects, the Merger and related matters;

        5.     compared our financial and operating performance with that of other companies with publicly traded equity securities that Houlihan Lokey deemed to be
relevant;

        6.     considered the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions that Houlihan Lokey deemed to be relevant;

        7.     reviewed the current and historical market prices and trading volume for our common stock and the current and historical market prices and trading volume of
the publicly traded securities of certain other companies that Houlihan Lokey deemed to be relevant; and

        8.     conducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other information and factors as Houlihan Lokey deemed appropriate.

        Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all data, material and other information furnished, or
otherwise made available, to it, discussed with or reviewed by it, or publicly available, and did not assume any responsibility with respect to such data, material and other
information. In addition, our management advised Houlihan Lokey, and Houlihan Lokey assumed, that the projections which the Company refers to as the projections prepared
under the "base case" scenario in the section "The Merger—Selected Company Projections" (the "Base Case Projections") were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of such management as to our future financial results and condition. At our direction, Houlihan Lokey assumed
that the Base Case Projections provided a reasonable basis on which to evaluate the Company and the Merger and Houlihan Lokey, at our direction, used and relied upon the
Base Case Projections for purposes of its analysis and opinion. Houlihan Lokey expressed no view or opinion with respect to the Base Case Projections or the assumptions on
which they were based. Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that there had been no change in our business, assets, liabilities, financial
condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects since the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise, provided
to Houlihan Lokey that would be material to its analysis or opinion, and that there was no information nor were there any facts that would make any of the information reviewed
by Houlihan Lokey incomplete or misleading.

        Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (a) the representations and warranties of all parties to the merger agreement and all other
related documents and instruments referred to therein were true and correct, (b) each party to the merger agreement and such other related documents and instruments would fully
and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by such party, (c) all conditions to the consummation of the Merger would be satisfied without
waiver thereof, and (d) the Merger would be consummated in a timely manner in accordance with the terms described in the merger agreement and such other related documents
and instruments, without any amendments or modifications thereto. Houlihan Lokey relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (i) the Merger would be
consummated in a manner that complies in all respects with all applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations, and (ii) all governmental, regulatory, and other consents
and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger would be obtained and that no delay, limitations, restrictions or conditions would be imposed or amendments,
modifications or waivers made that would have an effect on the Merger or us that would be material to Houlihan Lokey's analysis or opinion. In addition, Houlihan Lokey relied
upon and assumed, without independent verification, that the final form of the Merger Agreement would not differ in any respect from the draft merger agreement identified
above.

        Furthermore, in connection with its opinion, Houlihan Lokey was not requested to, and did not, make any physical inspection or independent appraisal or evaluation of any
of our or any other party's assets, properties or liabilities (fixed, contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise), nor was Houlihan Lokey provided with any such appraisal
or evaluation. Houlihan Lokey did not estimate, and expressed no opinion regarding, the liquidation value of any entity or business. Houlihan Lokey did not undertake any
independent analysis of any potential or actual litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to which we were or may have been a party
or were or may have been subject, or of any governmental investigation of any possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities to which we were or may have been a
party or were or may have been subject.

        Houlihan Lokey's opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date
of the opinion. Houlihan Lokey did not undertake, and is under no obligation, to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion, or otherwise comment on or consider events
occurring or coming to its attention after the date of the opinion. Houlihan Lokey did not express any opinion as to the price or range of prices at which our common stock could
be purchased or sold, or otherwise transferable, at any time.

        Houlihan Lokey's opinion was furnished for the use of the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and may not be used for any other
purpose without Houlihan Lokey's prior written consent. Under the terms of its engagement by the Board, neither Houlihan Lokey's opinion nor any other advice or services
rendered by it in connection with the Merger or otherwise should be construed as creating, and Houlihan Lokey should not be deemed to have, any fiduciary duty to or agency
relationship with the Board, the Company, any of our security holders or creditors or any other person, regardless of any prior or ongoing advice or relationships. The opinion is
not intended to be, and does not constitute, a recommendation to the Board, the Company, any of our security holders or any other party as to how to act or vote with respect to
any matter relating to the Merger or otherwise.

        Houlihan Lokey's opinion only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, to our stockholders, of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders in the
Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and did not address any other aspect or implication of the Merger, any related transaction or any agreement, arrangement or
understanding entered into in connection therewith or otherwise. Houlihan Lokey was not requested to opine as to, and its opinion did not express an opinion as to or otherwise
address, among other things: (i) the underlying business decision of the Board, the Company, our security holders or any other party to proceed with or effect the Merger, (ii) the
terms of any arrangements, understandings, agreements or documents related to, or the form, structure or any other portion or aspect of, the Merger or otherwise (other than the
Merger Consideration to the extent expressly specified in the opinion), (iii) the fairness of any portion or aspect of the Merger to the holders of any class of our securities, our
creditors or any of our other constituencies, or to any other party, except if and only to the extent expressly set forth in the last sentence of its opinion, (iv) the relative merits of
the Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might have been available to us or any other party, (v) the fairness of any portion or aspect of
the Merger to any one class or group of our or any other party's security holders or other constituents vis-à-vis any other class or group of our or such other party's security
holders or other constituents (including, without limitation, the allocation of any consideration amongst or within such classes or groups of security holders or other constituents),
(vi) whether or not we, Parent, our or their respective security holders or any other party is receiving or paying reasonably equivalent value in the Merger, (vii) the solvency,
creditworthiness or fair value of the Company, Parent or any other participant in the Merger, or any of their respective assets, under any applicable laws relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar matters, or (viii) the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to or
consideration payable to or received by any directors, officers or employees of any party to the Merger, any class of such persons or any other party, relative to the Merger
Consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, Houlihan Lokey did not express any opinion, counsel or interpretation regarding matters that require legal, regulatory, environmental,
accounting, insurance, tax or other similar professional advice. Houlihan Lokey assumed that such opinions, counsel or interpretations had been or would be obtained from the
appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, Houlihan Lokey relied, with the consent of the Board, on the assessments by the Board, us and our and their respective advisors as
to all legal, regulatory, environmental, accounting, insurance and tax matters with respect to us, the Merger or otherwise.

        In preparing its opinion to the Board, Houlihan Lokey performed a variety of analyses, including those described below. The summary of Houlihan Lokey's analyses is not a
complete description of the

analyses underlying Houlihan Lokey's opinion. The preparation of such an opinion is a complex process involving various quantitative and qualitative judgments and
determinations with respect to the financial, comparative and other analytical methods employed and the adaptation and application of these methods to the unique facts and
circumstances presented. As a consequence, neither Houlihan Lokey's opinion nor its underlying analyses is readily susceptible to summary description. Houlihan Lokey arrived
at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any individual
analysis, methodology or factor. While the results of each analysis were taken into account in reaching Houlihan Lokey's overall conclusion with respect to fairness, Houlihan
Lokey did not make separate or quantifiable judgments regarding individual analyses. Accordingly, Houlihan Lokey believes that its analyses and the following summary must
be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses, methodologies and factors, without considering all analyses, methodologies and factors, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Houlihan Lokey's analyses and opinion.

        In performing its analyses, Houlihan Lokey considered general business, economic, industry and market conditions, financial and otherwise, and other matters as they
existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its opinion. No company, transaction or business used in Houlihan Lokey's analyses for comparative purposes is identical to
the Company or the Merger and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not entirely mathematical. The estimates contained in the Base Case Projections and the implied
reference range values indicated by Houlihan Lokey's analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition, any analyses relating to the value of companies' assets, businesses or securities do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold, which may depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our
control. Much of the information used in, and accordingly the results of, Houlihan Lokey's analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

        Neither Houlihan Lokey's opinion nor its analyses were determinative of the Merger Consideration, which was determined through negotiation between the Company and
Parent. For additional information about the Board's reasons for recommending that stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, see "The Merger—Reasons for the
Merger; Recommendation of the Board," beginning on page 37.

Summary of Material Financial Analyses

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Houlihan Lokey in connection with the preparation of its opinion and reviewed with the Board
on March 30, 2017. The order of the analyses does not represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Houlihan Lokey or the Board. The analyses
summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the analyses. Considering the data in the tables
below without considering the full narrative description of the analyses, as well as the methodologies underlying, and the assumptions, qualifications and limitations affecting,
each analysis, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Houlihan Lokey's analyses.

        For purposes of its analyses, Houlihan Lokey reviewed a number of financial metrics, including:

• Enterprise Value—generally, the value as of a specified date of the relevant company's outstanding equity securities (taking into account outstanding options and
other securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into or for equity securities of the company) plus the amount of debt outstanding, preferred stock and
non-controlling interests, and less the amount of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.

• Adjusted EBITDA—generally, the amount of the relevant company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for a specified time period, as
adjusted for certain non-recurring items.

        Unless the context indicates otherwise, enterprise values and equity values used in the selected companies analysis described below were calculated using the closing price
of our common stock and the common stock of the selected companies listed below as of March 28, 2017, and transaction values for the selected transactions analysis described
below were calculated on an enterprise value basis based on the announced transaction equity price and other public information available at the time of the announcement. The
estimates of our future financial performance relied upon for the financial analyses described below were based on the Base Case Projections. The estimates of the future
financial performance of the selected companies listed below were based on publicly available research analyst estimates for those companies.

        Selected Companies Analysis.    Houlihan Lokey reviewed certain financial data for selected companies with publicly traded equity securities that Houlihan Lokey deemed
relevant. The selected companies were selected because they were deemed to be similar to the Company in one or more respects, including the nature of their business, size,
products, geography and financial performance. Houlihan Lokey identified a sufficient number of companies for purposes of its analysis but may not have included all companies
that might be deemed comparable to the Company. The financial data reviewed included:

• Enterprise value as a multiple of estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months, or "LTM Adjusted EBITDA"; 

• Enterprise value as a multiple of estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the next fiscal year, or "NFY Adjusted EBITDA"; and 

• Enterprise value as a multiple of estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the year following the next fiscal year, or "NFY + 1 Adjusted EBITDA."

        The selected companies and corresponding multiples were:

        Taking into account the results of the selected companies analysis and Houlihan Lokey's experience and professional judgment, Houlihan Lokey applied selected multiple
ranges of 9.5x to 10.5x to our LTM Adjusted EBITDA, 8.5x to 9.5x to our estimated NFY (2017E) Adjusted EBITDA and 8.0x to 9.0x to our estimated NFY + 1 (2018E)
Adjusted EBITDA. The selected companies analysis indicated implied reference ranges per share of our common stock of $13.06 to $14.62 based on LTM Adjusted EBITDA,
$12.90 to $14.62 based on NFY Adjusted EBITDA and $13.22 to $15.09 based on NFY + 1 Adjusted EBITDA, as compared to the Merger Consideration of $17.55 per share of
our common stock in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

        Selected Transactions Analysis.    Houlihan Lokey considered certain financial terms of certain transactions involving target companies that Houlihan Lokey deemed
relevant. The selected transactions were selected because the target companies were deemed to be similar to the Company in one or more respects, including the nature of their
business, size, products, geography and financial performance. Houlihan Lokey identified a sufficient number of transactions for purposes of its analysis but may not have
included all transactions that might be deemed comparable to the proposed Merger. The financial data reviewed included enterprise value as a multiple of LTM Adjusted
EBITDA, and the selected transactions and corresponding multiples were:

        Taking into account the results of the selected transactions analysis and Houlihan Lokey's experience and professional judgment, Houlihan Lokey applied a selected multiple
range of 8.5x to 9.5x to TRC's LTM Adjusted EBITDA. The selected transactions analysis indicated an implied reference range per share of our common stock of $11.50 to
$13.06, as compared to the Merger Consideration of $17.55 per share of our common stock in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

        Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.    Houlihan Lokey performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company using unlevered free cash flows based on the Base Case
Projections. Based on its experience and professional judgment, Houlihan Lokey applied a range of terminal value multiples of 8.5x to 9.5x to our projected Adjusted EBITDA
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021 and discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 13.0%. The discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied reference range per share of our
common stock of $15.36 to $17.61, as compared to the Merger Consideration of $17.55 per share of our common stock in the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Other Matters

        We engaged Houlihan Lokey to act as our financial advisor in connection with a possible business combination transaction. The Board engaged Houlihan Lokey based on
Houlihan Lokey's experience and reputation. Houlihan Lokey is regularly engaged to provide financial advisory services in connection with mergers and acquisitions, financings,
and financial restructurings. Pursuant to Houlihan Lokey's engagement by the Company, we are obligated to pay Houlihan Lokey a transaction fee based on the value of the
Merger, currently estimated to be approximately $8.5 to $9.0 million, of which $750,000 became payable to Houlihan Lokey upon the rendering of its opinion to the Board and
the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. We have also agreed to reimburse Houlihan Lokey for certain expenses and to indemnify Houlihan
Lokey and certain related parties for certain potential liabilities and arising out of Houlihan Lokey's engagement.

NMC, an affiliate of Parent, or one or more security holders, affiliates and/or portfolio companies of investment funds affiliated or associated with NMC (collectively with NMC,
the "NMC Group"), including, during the last two years, having provided certain financial advisory services to one or more members of the NMC Group and representing a
creditor group that included one or more members of the NMC Group, for which advice and services Houlihan Lokey received aggregate fees of approximately $3.0 million.

Furthermore, in connection with bankruptcies, restructurings, and similar matters, Houlihan Lokey and certain of its affiliates may have in the past acted, may currently be acting
and may in the future act as financial advisor to debtors, creditors, equity holders, trustees, agents and other interested parties (including, without limitation, formal and informal
committees or groups of creditors) that may have included or represented and may include or represent, directly or indirectly, or may be or have been adverse to, us, Parent,
members of the NMC Group, other participants in the Merger or certain of their respective affiliates or security holders, for which advice and services Houlihan Lokey and its
affiliates have received and may receive compensation.

Selected Company Projections 

        We do not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance, earnings or other results given the unpredictability of underlying assumptions and
estimates. However, we provided to the Board and the Special Committee, as well as to NMC and certain other potential buyers, in connection with their due diligence review,
certain projections concerning our future financial performance, which our management prepared based on our five-year strategic plan for fiscal years 2017-2021 and in
preparation for due diligence by potential buyers.

        The projections were prepared by, and are the responsibility of, our management. They were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and, accordingly, do not
necessarily comply with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
financial forecasts, or generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has
not audited, reviewed, compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the projections and does not express an opinion or any form of assurance related thereto.
The summary of the projections is being included solely to give our stockholders access to certain projections made available to the parties noted above; it is not being included
to influence a stockholder's decision whether to approve the Merger Proposal or for any other purpose.

        The projections, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and involve
judgments with respect to, among

Table of Contents

other things, our business, including decisions with respect thereto, and future economic, competitive and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to
predict and many of which are beyond our control. Because the projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive
year. In addition, the projections might be affected by our ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable periods. Other than as described below, the
projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared, including the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
or the announcement thereof. Furthermore, the projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the transactions described in the Merger Agreement to occur and
should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. The projections are also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the risks and
uncertainties described in "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information," beginning on page 21, including those described further in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, and subsequent filings made with the SEC.

        Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projections will be realized, and actual results may vary materially from those shown. The inclusion of the projections below
should not be regarded as an indication that we or any of our affiliates, advisors, directors, officers or representatives considered or consider the projections to be predictive of
actual future events or events which have occurred since the date of such forecasts, and the projections should not be relied upon as such. None of the Company, Parent or any of
our or their affiliates, advisors, directors, officers or representatives can provide any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the projections, and neither we
nor they undertake any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date they were generated, or to reflect the
occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the projections are shown to be in error. We do not intend to make publicly available
any update or other revision to the prospective financial information, except as otherwise required by law. None of the Company, Parent or any of our or their affiliates, advisors,
directors, officers or representatives has made or makes any representation to any of our stockholders or other person regarding our ultimate performance compared to the
information contained in the projections or that the projections will necessarily be achieved. We have made no representation to Parent, Merger Sub or their affiliates, in the
Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning the projections.

        In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the projections, stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the projections.
The projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the information about us contained elsewhere in this proxy statement and the historical financial
statements and other information about us contained in our SEC filings.

Base Case Projections 

        Below is a summary of the Base Case Projections that we authorized Houlihan Lokey to use and rely upon for the purposes of advising the Board. The Base Case
Projections reflect expected organic growth over the period set forth therein, the assumed completion of our then-pending acquisition of certain assets from Ameresco, Inc. and
Applied Energy Group, Inc. and of our then-pending acquisition of Caltrop Corporation, and the assumed integration of those assets and businesses into our operations. The
financial model underlying the Base Case Projections was distributed to potential buyers as part of the due diligence process, although the distributed financial model excluded
expenses

Acquisition Case Projections 

        In addition to the Base Case Projections listed above, we prepared projections based on an "acquisition case" scenario, which reflected the assumptions in the Base Case
Projections, as well as the potential incremental effect of six hypothetical acquisitions that were assumed to occur during the five-year projection period (the "Acquisition Case
Projections"). We provided the Acquisition Case Projections to the Board and the Special Committee, as well as to NMC and certain other potential buyers, in connection with
the early stages of their due diligence review. However, because of the highly speculative nature of the hypothetical acquisitions underlying the Acquisition Case Projections,
including whether we would be able to successfully negotiate, finance, complete and integrate such hypothetical acquisitions, the Acquisition Case Projections were not viewed
as a realistic estimate of our potential performance over the projection period, and were not authorized for use by Houlihan Lokey for the purposes of preparing its opinion or
considered by the Board or the Special Committee in evaluating the Merger Agreement. The Acquisition Case Projections were, rather, specifically prepared to market the
Company to potential buyers.

Financing the Merger 

        The Merger is not subject to a financing condition. We anticipate that the total funds needed by Parent and Merger Sub to complete the Merger (including the funds to pay
our stockholders and the holders of Company Equity Awards, to pay related fees in connection with the Merger and associated transactions, and to repay or refinance our
indebtedness that will be payable as a result of the Merger, including approximately $57.0 million that we expect to be outstanding as of that time under our Credit Agreement)
will be approximately $664.0 million, which we expect will be funded through a combination of the following:

• an equity financing (as further described under "—Equity Commitments" below); 

• a debt financing (as further described under "—Debt Financing" below); and 

• cash of the Company expected to be on hand and available at the closing.

Table of Contents

Equity Commitments

        Parent has entered into the Equity Commitment Letter with the Equity Investor, pursuant to which the Equity Investor committed to capitalize Parent, contemporaneous with
the closing of the Merger, with an aggregate equity financing commitment of up to $665.0 million in cash, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, including the
contemporaneous closing of the Merger and that all conditions for consummation of the Merger under the Merger Agreement are satisfied or, in the case of conditions to Parent's
obligations, validly waived by Parent with the consent of the Equity Investor. Parent plans to finance a portion of the amounts required to complete the Merger pursuant to such
an equity financing.

        Under certain circumstances, we are entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of the Merger
Agreement and to enforce the terms of the Merger Agreement, and also to cause Parent to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity Commitment Letter in connection with the
consummation of the Merger.

        The Equity Commitment Letter will terminate upon, among other events, the closing of the Merger, valid termination of the Merger Agreement, our bringing certain claims
against the Equity Investor under the Guarantee, or, as described in the paragraph below, upon the occurrence of an event pursuant to which the Equity Investor's obligations or
liabilities under the Guarantee would terminate.

        The Equity Investor provided the Guarantee in favor of the Company, pursuant to which the Equity Investor has agreed to guarantee the payment, if and when required and
due, of all of the liabilities and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, including certain cost and reimbursement obligations specified in the Merger
Agreement and monetary damages claimed by the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement, all of which are subject to an aggregate cap of approximately $38.8 million. The
Equity Investor's obligations and liabilities under the Guarantee will terminate upon, among other events, the closing of the Merger, the payment in full by the Equity Investor of
the obligations guaranteed under the Guarantee, termination of the Merger Agreement due to our breach of our non-solicitation obligations or in connection with our entry into a
definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, or otherwise within 90 days following any other event of termination of the Merger Agreement (provided that the Equity
Investor will remain responsible for any valid claims we may assert during such 90-day period and to the extent that we bring a legal proceeding to claim payment thereof).

        We expect that the amounts committed under the Equity Commitment Letter, together with cash of the Company expected to be on hand and available at the closing, would,
in the absence of a debt financing, be sufficient to complete the Merger, pay related fees in connection with the Merger and related transactions and to repay the amount
outstanding under the Credit Agreement, but we cannot assure you of that. The proceeds of any such equity and cash financing could be insufficient if, among other things, the
Equity Investor fails to purchase its committed amount in breach of the Equity Commitment Letter or if our indebtedness or the fees required to be paid to complete the Merger
are greater than anticipated.

Debt Financing

        Parent also plans to finance a portion of the amounts required to complete the Merger by conducting a debt financing, which may take the form of a revolving credit facility,
a term loan facility, a bridge facility or a note offering. Subject to certain customary exceptions, we have agreed to, agreed to cause our subsidiaries to, and agreed to use
reasonable best efforts to require our and their representatives to, provide Parent with customary and necessary cooperation as reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub to
assist them in arranging the debt financing to be obtained in connection with the Merger.

        For more information regarding the planned debt financing and our obligations with respect to such a financing, see "The Merger Agreement—Financing Cooperation;
Marketing Period; Related Indemnification" beginning on page 75.

Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Merger Proposal, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have certain
interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. The members of the Board were aware of, and considered, these
interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and in recommending that our stockholders vote for the Merger Proposal. Our stockholders
should take these interests into account when deciding whether to vote for the Merger Proposal. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are
quantified within the narrative disclosure and in the tables below.

        The amounts in this section have been calculated assuming that the Effective Time occurs on May 8, 2017, and are based on the other estimates and assumptions described
below under "—Golden Parachute Compensation" beginning on page 56, among others provided below. The amounts in this section do not include amounts payable under
agreements, plans or arrangements to the extent they do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of our executive officers.

Ongoing Arrangements with Certain Executive Officers

        As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers has entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the
right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to or following the closing of the Merger, however, we expect that
certain of our executive officers may enter into agreements with Parent or Merger Sub regarding employment with the Surviving Corporation. In addition, certain of our
executive officers may enter into agreements with Parent or Merger Sub regarding the right to purchase or participate in the equity of the Surviving Corporation, although we do
not expect that such equity ownership, if any, individually or in the aggregate, would constitute a material interest in the Surviving Corporation. There can be no assurance that
any parties will reach an agreement on any terms, or at all.

Company Equity Awards

        As described below in "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Common Stock and Company Equity Awards," beginning on page 64, Company Equity Awards will vest
immediately prior to the Effective Time (with the vesting for PSUs based on actual performance of applicable performance goals for such PSUs, subject to certain adjustments in
the event that the closing of the Merger occurs prior to June 30, 2017) and be canceled and converted into the right to receive a specified amount of cash, without interest and less
applicable tax withholding, based on the Merger Consideration, except as otherwise agreed in writing between any holder of Company Equity Awards and Parent.

        For an estimate of the value of the unvested Company Equity Awards held by each of our named executive officers that will become vested at the Effective Time, please
refer to "Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation," beginning on page 56. Based on the assumptions set forth below,
the estimated amount of such consideration that Mr. Stephenson (our only executive officer other than the named executive officers) would receive is approximately $2.2 million.

        Our non-employee directors hold unvested time-based RSUs. The estimated amount of the consideration that our non-employee directors (as a group) would receive, in the
aggregate, in respect of their unvested RSUs in connection with the Merger is approximately $1.0 million. For more

        On March 30, 2017, we entered into a transaction bonus agreement with Mr. Vincze. The agreement provides that Mr. Vincze will be entitled to receive a transaction bonus,
less applicable tax withholding, payable in a lump sum within 30 days of the closing of the Merger, subject to Mr. Vincze's assistance in bringing the Merger to successful
completion and his continued employment with us through the date of closing of the Merger. Mr. Vincze's transaction bonus will be approximately $5.0 million, calculated as
$2.4 million, plus the product of (a) $1.567 million, divided by the average closing price of our common stock on NYSE over the 90 trading days immediately prior to March 30,
2017, multiplied by (b) the Merger Consideration.

Completion Bonus Agreements with Messrs. Bennet, Dodd and Stephenson 

        On April 18, 2017, we entered into a completion bonus agreement with Mr. Bennet, pursuant to which we agreed to pay him a bonus of $640,000, less applicable tax
withholding, within 30 days following the closing of the Merger. The completion bonus agreement with Mr. Bennet provides for payment of the completion bonus, provided that
(a) he assists in bringing the Merger to a successful completion, (b) he remains in good standing with us through the closing of the Merger, (c) he waives, and releases us from,
any payments that could be owed to him under our Change in Control Severance Plan for Key Executives (the "CIC Plan") and (d) the closing of the Merger occurs within one
year of the execution of his completion bonus agreement.

        On April 5 and 18, 2017, respectively, we entered into completion bonus agreements with Messrs. Stephenson and Dodd. Pursuant to these agreements, we agreed to pay
each of Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Dodd completion bonuses of $200,000, less applicable tax withholding, on the first regularly scheduled pay day following closing of the Merger,
provided that (a) the executive officer assists in bringing the Merger to a successful completion, (b) the executive officer remains in good standing with us through the date of the
closing and (c) the closing occurs within one year of the execution of the executive officer's completion bonus agreement.

Employment Agreement with Christopher Vincze

        Under certain circumstances, Mr. Vincze will also be eligible for additional payments and benefits pursuant to his third amended and restated employment agreement, dated
June 28, 2011. Pursuant to his employment agreement, if we terminate Mr. Vincze's employment for any reason other than death, disability, or cause (as defined below) or if
Mr. Vincze terminates employment with us for good reason (as defined below) (each a "qualifying termination"), we will make the following payments: (i) lump sum payment
six months after a qualifying termination to Mr. Vincze equal to the greater of (a) two and one half times his annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of such
termination and (b) $1.25 million, (ii) a payment to Mr. Vincze for his pro-rated annual bonus in the fiscal year of the qualifying termination, based on actual performance, six
months after his qualifying termination, (iii) to the extent permitted by law, benefit continuation for a period of two years following his qualifying termination (or a lump sum
payment six months following his termination if continued coverage cannot be provided), and (iv) Mr. Vincze's automobile allowance for this two-year period in a lump sum six
months after his qualifying termination. In addition, we will pay Mr. Vincze his accrued base salary and accrued but unused vacation, if any, through the date of such qualifying
termination.

Table of Contents

Each of these benefits is further conditioned upon Mr. Vincze's compliance with the non-competition and non-solicitation covenants during his employment and for one year
following his qualifying termination and with perpetual confidentiality covenants.

        In the event that we undergo a change of control (as defined below, and which would include the Merger) and Mr. Vincze's employment agreement is not assumed by our
successor, Mr. Vincze would receive a lump sum payment six months after the change of control equal to the greater of (a) two and one half times his annual base salary in effect
immediately prior to the change of control and (b) $1.25 million.

        Mr. Vincze's employment agreement defines "cause" as (a) any act or omission that constitutes a material breach by Mr. Vincze of any of his obligations thereunder, or under
any other material agreement with, or material written policy of, the Company, which act or omission is not cured within 30 days of our providing him with notice of the act,
omission, or failure deemed to constitute cause, (b) the failure or refusal by Mr. Vincze to follow any lawful reasonable written direction of the Board, which failure or refusal is
not cured within 30 days of our providing him with reasonably detailed written notice of the failure or refusal deemed to constitute cause, (c) Mr. Vincze's conviction of a felony
or a crime involving moral turpitude, or his perpetration of a fraud, or (d) any other willful act or omission by Mr. Vincze which we reasonably believe is or will be materially
injurious to our financial condition or business reputation of, or is otherwise materially injurious to, which act or omission is not cured within 30 days of our providing him with
reasonably detailed written notice of the act or omission deemed to constitute cause.

        Mr. Vincze's employment agreement defines "good reason" as (a) a permanent assignment of Mr. Vincze to a role materially inconsistent with, or which constitutes a
material adverse diminution in, his position, duties, responsibilities, or status with us, or a material adverse diminution in his reporting responsibilities, title, or offices, (b) a
material breach by us of his employment agreement or any other material agreement between us and Mr. Vincze, or (c) a requirement that Mr. Vincze relocate his principal place
of employment to a location outside a radius of 50 miles from our offices in Lowell, Massachusetts, each upon 30 business days' advance written notice to us and to the extent the
claim is not cured within such 30 business-day period.

        Mr. Vincze's employment agreement defines "change of control" as (a) our merger or consolidation with another entity, as a result of which we are not the surviving entity,
(b) the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or all or substantially all of the assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries and (c) the acquisition, by an entity, person or group of
beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of our capital stock if, immediately after such acquisition, such entity, person or group is entitled to
exercise more than 50% of the outstanding voting power of our capital stock entitled to vote at elections of directors.

Change in Control Severance Plan for Key Executives

        Our CIC Plan provides certain of our key employees, including each of our executive officers other than Mr. Vincze, with certain severance benefits if we terminate the
executive officer's employment without cause (as defined below) or the executive officer resigns for good reason (as defined below), in each case during the period beginning six
months before a change in control (as defined below), including the closing of the Merger, and ending on the second anniversary of such a change in control (the "Protected
Period"). Specifically, the CIC Plan provides that within 15 business days of termination without cause of, or resignation for good reason by, any of our non-CEO executive
officers during the Protected Period, the executive officer will receive a lump sum payment equal to his total annual compensation (as defined below), accrued but unpaid salary
and expenses through the date of such termination or resignation, and any additional amounts owed to him under applicable employment-related legislation or common law
doctrine, to the extent the executive officer cannot waive the amounts owed under such legislation or common law doctrine. In addition, on the date of

Table of Contents

termination or resignation, any unvested stock options or restricted stock held by the executive officer will automatically vest. Payment of severance benefits to any executive
officer under the CIC Plan is conditioned upon such executive officer's execution of a general release of claims. As noted above, Mr. Bennet waived his right to any severance
benefits under the CIC Plan pursuant to his completion bonus agreement.

        The CIC Plan defines "cause" as the executive officer's willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties, or
conviction for a felony. No act, or failure to act, on the executive officer's part will be considered (a) "willful" unless he has acted, or failed to act, with an absence of good faith
and without a reasonable belief that his action or failure to act was in our best interests, or (b) to establish "cause" unless the Board has first given the executive officer both a
written notice detailing the conduct that is alleged to constitute cause, and a reasonable opportunity to justify or cure (if possible) such conduct.

        The CIC Plan defines "good reason" as any of the following events: (a) the requirement that the executive officer's principal executive function be performed more than 30
miles from his primary office as of July 1, 2013 or any subsequent location to which he has not asserted good reason for resignation, (b) a material reduction in the executive
officer's base compensation as the same may be increased from time to time, other than as part of an across-the-board program affecting all senior officers, (c) our failure to
provide the executive officer with compensation and benefits substantially similar to those provided to him under any of the executive benefit plans in which he now or hereafter
becomes a participant, or the taking of any action by us which would directly or indirectly reduce any of such benefits or deprive the executive officer of any material fringe
benefit enjoyed by him, (d) a material diminution in the executive officer's authority, duties, or responsibilities, (e) a material diminution in the authority, duties, or
responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the executive officer reports, (f) a material diminution in the budget over which the executive officer has authority, or (g) any other
action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by us of the terms and conditions of the executive officer's employment. In order for such an event to constitute good reason,
however, the executive officer must give notice thereof within 90 days of the event's occurrence and we must not have cured it within 30 days following such notice.

        The CIC Plan defines "total annual compensation" as the sum of the following: (a) the executive officer's gross annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to a change
in control, (b) the higher of the executive officer's cash bonus at the target level, as established for the fiscal year in which the change in control occurs, and the actual bonus
reasonably projected to be earned by the executive officer in such fiscal year absent the change in control, and (c) the cost of all perquisites and benefits for the 12-month period
before the change in control (or, if higher, the date of the executive officer's termination without cause or resignation for good cause). "Change in control" under the CIC Plan has
the same meaning as "change of control" in Mr. Vincze's employment agreement.

Future Compensation Actions

        The Merger Agreement allows us to grant stock options, RSUs or PSUs to new hires prior to the completion of the Merger, not to exceed 10,000 shares underlying any
individual award and 100,000 shares underlying all such awards in the aggregate. Generally, however, the Merger Agreement does not permit us to change the compensation
arrangements of our directors or executive officers during this period except as otherwise disclosed in this proxy statement.

Golden Parachute Compensation

        The information set forth in the tables below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC's Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure regarding the compensation for
each of our named executive officers that may be paid or become payable in connection with the completion of the Merger.

Table of Contents

        Except as otherwise indicated, the amounts included in the tables below and footnotes thereto have been calculated based on the estimates and assumptions set forth below.

• Calculations related to the value of unvested Company Equity Awards were based on a price per share equal to $17.55, the Merger Consideration. 

• The Effective Time will occur on May 8, 2017. As a result, all Company Equity Awards that are scheduled to vest prior to such date have been excluded from the
amounts presented in the tables below. Depending on when the closing date occurs, certain equity based awards shown in the table may vest in accordance with
their terms. 

• Each named executive officer's employment with us will be terminated without cause as of the Effective Time. 

• Payment of any compensation tied to the amount of a cash bonus earned by a named executive officer has been calculated assuming achievement of maximum
level performance. 

• Payouts of PSUs have been calculated assuming maximum level performance. PSUs have a maximum payout of up to 150% of target based on our earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, for the performance period.

        Certain other estimates and assumptions are set forth in the footnotes accompanying the tables. Because the amounts reported in the tables and footnotes are estimates based
on multiple estimates and assumptions, which may or may not actually occur, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may differ materially from
the amounts set forth in the tables below.

closing of the Merger, provided that each of them remains employed with us through such date and assists in bringing the Merger to a successful
completion and, with respect to Mr. Bennet and Mr. Dodd, that certain other conditions are satisfied. The amounts of such bonuses are $5.03 million
with respect to Mr. Vincze, $640,000 for Mr. Bennet and $200,000 for Mr. Dodd. Additional information with respect to these bonuses is presented

Indemnification and Insurance

        Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, our directors and officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance," beginning on page 83, for a description of
such ongoing indemnification and coverage obligations.

(3) The amounts reported include $2,700,001 in cash and $118,839 in perquisites and other benefits that we would owe Mr. Vincze if we terminated his
employment without cause as of the Effective Time. These amounts are derived from Mr. Vincze's employment agreement, which provides that he will
receive the following severance benefits if he is terminated without cause: (a) a lump sum equal to the greater of (i) two and one half times his annual
base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of his termination and (ii) $1.25 million, and (b) his accrued base salary, accrued but unused vacation,
and pro-rated cash bonus, if any, through the date of termination. Also, to the extent permitted by law, we would be required to provide Mr. Vincze with
benefit continuation for a period of two years following the termination, except that we must make a lump sum payment to Mr. Vincze for his
automobile allowance during this period. If we are unable to continue Mr. Vincze's benefits following his termination, we must pay him the cost of such
coverage in a lump sum. 

(4) Each of Mr. Cowdery, Mr. Dodd and Mr. Mayer is eligible for "double-trigger" severance benefits under the CIC Plan upon termination of his
employment without cause beginning six months before the closing of the Merger, and ending on the second anniversary of the closing of the Merger.
Such benefits would consist of a lump sum payment equal to such named executive officer's total annual compensation, accrued but unpaid salary and
expenses through the date of the termination. Because we have assumed that such a termination would coincide with the Effective Time, we have
further assumed that there would be no additional benefit from the vesting of Company Equity Awards. Based on the assumptions and estimates set
forth in this section, we estimate that we would owe the following benefits to each of these named executive officers if the CIC Plan was triggered:

James Mayer   809,487  47,323  856,810 

These amounts are included in the table entitled "Potential Change in Control Payments to Named Executive Officers" above. As previously noted,
Mr. Bennet waived his right to receive severance benefits under the CIC Plan pursuant to his completion bonus agreement.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger 

        The Merger Agreement provides that the closing of the Merger will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, no later than the third business day following the date on which
the last of the conditions to closing of the Merger (described under "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger," beginning on page 78) has been satisfied or waived
(other than the conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) unless another time, date
or place is agreed by us and Parent; provided that if the Marketing Period (as described under "The Merger Agreement—Financing Cooperation; Marketing Period; Related
Indemnification" beginning on page 75) has not ended at such time, then the closing of the Merger will instead occur on the date following the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the closing) that is the earlier to occur of (a) any business day during the Marketing Period as may be
specified by Parent on no less than two business days' prior notice to us and (b) the second business day following the final day of the Marketing Period. We currently expect the
closing of the Merger to occur by June 30, 2017.

        The Effective Time will occur at the closing of the Merger upon the filing of a certificate of merger with, and acceptance by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(or at such later time as the parties may agree and specify in the certificate of merger).

Payment of Merger Consideration and Surrender of Shares 

General

        Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with a reputable bank or trust company to be designated by Parent or
Merger Sub and which is reasonably acceptable to us (the "Paying Agent") an amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to the holders of our common stock
(other than shares that we, Parent or Merger Sub own and Dissenting Shares).

        Promptly, and in any event no later than two business days, after the date of the Effective Time, each stockholder of record of certificated shares of our common stock (other
than us, Parent or Merger Sub or holders of Dissenting Shares) will be sent a letter of transmittal and instructions describing how such record holder may exchange his, her or its
shares of our common stock for the Merger Consideration.

        Except as noted below with respect to lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificates, if you are a stockholder of record of certificated shares of our common stock, you will not
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration until you surrender your stock certificate or certificates to the Paying Agent and deliver a duly completed and executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent, along with any other documents required pursuant to the instructions. If ownership of your shares is not registered in our transfer records,
payment will only be made to you if the certificate formerly representing such shares is accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

        If you have lost a stock certificate, or if it has been stolen or destroyed, then before you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, you will have to make an
affidavit of the loss, theft or destruction, and if required by Parent, to post a bond in a customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. These procedures will be described
in the letter of transmittal and instructions that you will receive, which you should read carefully in their entirety.

        If you are a record holder of book-entry shares of our common stock, you will not be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration until you surrender your book-entry shares
along with a letter of

Table of Contents

transmittal duly completed and executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and any other documents required pursuant to such instructions. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to book-entry shares will only be made to the person in whose name those shares are registered.

        No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable as the Merger Consideration upon your surrender of shares of our common stock, whether in certificated or book-
entry form.

Certain Exchange and Payment Procedures Applicable to Both Holders of Certificated Shares and Holders of Book-Entry Shares

        We, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold any applicable taxes from the Merger Consideration. Any sum that is
withheld will be deemed to have been paid to the holder of shares with regard to whom it is withheld.

        From and after the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on our stock transfer books of shares of our common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any person presents for transfer to the Surviving Corporation any certificate or book-entry share with respect to our common stock,
such certificate or book-entry share will be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration to which such person is entitled pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

        The Surviving Corporation is entitled to request that any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by our stockholders
for 12 months after the Effective Time be delivered to it (other than shares that we, Parent or Merger Sub own and Dissenting Shares), and thereafter holders of our common
stock (other than shares that we, Parent or Merger Sub own and Dissenting Shares) may only look to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws). None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent will be liable to any of our former
stockholders for cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

Regulatory Waiting Period and Approval Required for Merger 

        The Merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, which prevented us and Parent from consummating the Merger until required information and materials were
furnished to the DOJ and FTC and the HSR Act waiting period terminated or expired. On April 13, 2017, we and Parent filed the requisite notification and report forms under the
HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC. On April 25, 2017, the FTC granted early termination of the 30-day waiting period under the HSR Act, with respect to the proposed Merger.
The grant of early termination has the effect of satisfying the HSR Act condition under the Merger Agreement.

        For a description of our and Parent's respective obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to regulatory approvals, see the section of this proxy statement entitled
"The Merger Agreement—Efforts to Obtain Regulatory Approval," beginning on page 75.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The following describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) that hold as capital assets their shares of our
common stock that are converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), its
legislative history, existing and proposed regulations under the Code, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in effect. These laws are subject to change, possibly
on a retroactive basis.

        This discussion does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to our stockholders and does not apply if you received your
shares of our common stock in

connection with the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation, hold an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or the Surviving Corporation
after the Merger, or have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for, or lost the right to, appraisal under the DGCL. This discussion also does not apply to you if you are an
insurance company, a bank, a tax-exempt organization or tax-qualified retirement plan, a financial institution, a broker or dealer, a partnership, S corporation or other pass-
through entity, a mutual fund, a trader in securities who has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting, subject to the alternative minimum tax, have a functional currency
other than the U.S. dollar or hold our common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, wash sale, constructive sale or conversion transaction.

        For purposes of this discussion, you are a "U.S. holder" if you are a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock and you are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

• a domestic corporation; 

• a trust (i) that is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and all substantial decisions of which are subject to the control of one or more U.S.
persons (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S.
person; or 

• an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.

        If a partnership or any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner
generally will depend on the status and activities of the partner and the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the partnership. A partner of a partnership exchanging shares our
common stock in the Merger should consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state and local income and any foreign tax consequences of the Merger to such partner.

        This discussion addresses only U.S. holders and does not address the U.S. tax consequences to any stockholder who, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a non-resident
alien individual, foreign corporation, foreign partnership or foreign estate or trust, and does not address the receipt of cash in connection with the treatment of RSUs, PSUs or
other equity awards, or any other matters relating to equity compensation or benefit plans.

        This discussion is provided for general information only and does not constitute legal advice to any stockholder. You should consult your own tax advisor
regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger in your particular circumstances, as well as any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the
Merger.

Exchange of Shares of Common Stock for Cash Pursuant to the Merger Agreement

        The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash in the Merger will be treated as a taxable sale of the shares for cash for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, if
you are a U.S. holder and your shares of our common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger, you will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and your adjusted tax basis in such shares. Your adjusted tax basis
generally will equal the price you paid for the shares. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of shares of our common stock that you convert (i.e., shares of
common stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction).

        Any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if your holding period for the converted shares exceeds one year at the Effective Time.
Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. holder is generally taxed at preferential rates. There are limitations on the

deductibility of capital losses. In addition, a 3.8% tax is imposed on all or a portion of the "net investment income" (within the meaning of the Code) of certain individuals and on
the undistributed net investment income of certain estates and trusts. The 3.8% tax generally is imposed on the lesser of (1) your "net investment income" for the relevant taxable
year and (2) the excess of your adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a threshold (which in the case of individuals is between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the
individual's circumstances). "Net investment income" for this purpose generally will include any gain recognized on the receipt of cash for shares pursuant to the Merger.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

        If you are a U.S. holder and your shares of our common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger, you may be subject to information reporting. In
addition, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder, the cash you receive in exchange for your shares in the Merger will be subject to backup withholding of tax at the statutory rate,
unless you (or the relevant other payee) provide a taxpayer identification number, certify that the taxpayer identification number is correct, and otherwise comply with the backup
withholding rules. If you are a U.S. holder, you should complete and sign, under penalty of perjury, the Form W-9 attached to the letter of transmittal and return it to the Paying
Agent in order to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding, unless you otherwise establish in a manner satisfactory to the Paying Agent
that an exemption from backup withholding applies to you.

        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. If any amounts were withheld from a cash payment to you pursuant to the Merger under the backup withholding rules, you
generally would be able to obtain a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability if you timely furnish the required information to the Internal Revenue Service.
U.S. holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to qualifications for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining the exemption.

Delisting and Deregistration of Our Common Stock 

        If the Merger is completed, our common stock will no longer be traded on the NYSE and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act. We will no longer be required to file
periodic reports, current reports and proxy and information statements with the SEC on account of our common stock.

Consequences If the Merger Is Not Completed 

        If the Merger is not completed, whether because the Merger Agreement is not adopted by our stockholders or for any other reason, we will remain an independent public
company, and we will remain an SEC reporting company. In addition, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. In that circumstance, our
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the Merger. Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay to Parent a
fee with respect to the termination of the Merger Agreement, and/or to reimburse Parent and its affiliates for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses as
described under "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by the Company."

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        This section describes the material terms of the Merger Agreement. The description of the Merger Agreement in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to
read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement 

        The Merger Agreement and this summary of its terms are included to provide you with information regarding its terms. Factual disclosures about us contained in this proxy
statement or in our public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures about us contained in the Merger Agreement. The representations,
warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only as of specified dates for the purposes of the Merger Agreement were solely for the benefit of the
parties to the Merger Agreement and may be subject to qualifications and limitations agreed upon by the parties thereto. In particular, in reviewing the representations, warranties
and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement and discussed in the foregoing description, it is important to bear in mind that such representations, warranties and covenants
were negotiated with the principal purpose of allocating risk between the parties, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations, warranties and covenants may also
be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were
qualified by matters contained in the disclosure letter that we delivered to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the Merger Agreement, which disclosures were not expressly
reflected in the text of the Merger Agreement. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, stockholders should not rely on such
representations, warranties and covenants as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances described therein. Information concerning the subject matter of such
representations, warranties and covenants may have changed after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the
parties' public disclosures.

The Merger 

        The Merger Agreement provides for the Merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company upon the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth in the Merger Agreement
and in accordance with the DGCL. As the Surviving Corporation, we will continue to exist as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent following the Merger.

Directors and Officers; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws 

        The board of directors of the Surviving Corporation will, from and after the Effective Time, consist of the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until their respective successors have been duly elected, designated or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. Our officers immediately prior to the Effective Time will, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected, designated or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

        At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth in Exhibit B to the Merger
Agreement, and

the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will be amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth in Exhibit C to the Merger Agreement.

        Following the completion of the Merger, our common stock will be delisted from NYSE and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act. We will no longer be required to
file periodic reports, current reports and proxy and information statements with the SEC on account of our common stock.

Treatment of Common Stock and Company Equity Awards 

Common Stock

        At the Effective Time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior thereto (other than shares that we, Parent or Merger Sub own and
Dissenting Shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. All shares owned by us, Parent or Merger Sub will be automatically
canceled and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. Our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder of Dissenting Shares pursuant to, and in compliance in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Appraisal Rights") will be entitled to payment of the fair value
of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the appraisal rights described under "Appraisal Rights Under Delaware Law," beginning on page 87, and such Dissenting Shares
will automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and such holder will cease to have any rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares other than the right to receive the appraised
value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by the Appraisal Rights. If any of our stockholders fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under the Appraisal Rights, the right of such stockholder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares will cease and
such Dissenting Shares will be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time solely into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

Company Equity Awards

        The Merger Agreement provides for the following treatment as of Company Equity Awards. All amounts paid pursuant to the settlement of Company Equity Awards at the
Effective Time will be made by the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than the first payroll date that is at least five
business days after the closing of the Merger.

Stock Options 

        Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing between any holder of stock options and Parent, each outstanding unvested and unexercised
option to purchase shares of our common stock will become immediately vested and exercisable in full. At the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option will be canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares for which the option remains outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of the option, without interest and less applicable tax
withholding. Any stock option that is outstanding at the Effective Time that has an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be canceled
without payment.

Restricted Stock Units 

        Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing between any holder of RSUs and Parent, all outstanding unvested RSUs will become
immediately vested, and all restrictions on such awards will lapse. At the Effective Time, outstanding RSUs will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of

RSUs held immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration, without interest and less applicable tax withholding.

Performance Stock Units 

        Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing between any holder of PSUs and Parent, all outstanding PSUs will become vested based on
actual achievement of applicable performance goals for such PSUs. If the Effective Time occurs prior to June 30, 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board will determine
in good faith the amounts of PSUs that will vest by assuming achievement of performance goals for any portion of the applicable performance period that had not been
completed, taking into consideration our historical levels of performance with respect to the applicable performance goals. At the Effective Time, vested PSUs will be canceled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of vested PSUs held immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
Merger Consideration, without interest and less applicable tax withholding.

will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, complete control and supervision over our and our subsidiaries' operations.

No Solicitation of Competing Proposals

Proposal and (ii) one such reaffirmation request not in connection with the disclosure or announcement of a Competing Proposal;

• following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer relating to our common stock by a person unaffiliated with Parent, fail to reaffirm the Company
Board Recommendation and recommend that our stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within five business days after the commencement of

preceding the scheduled date of the special meeting);

Recommendation"); or 

• cause or permit us to enter into any definitive or binding agreement, letter of intent, term sheet, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement providing for, facilitating or endorsing a Competing Proposal.

        A "Competing Proposal" means, other than the Merger, any inquiry, proposal or offer made by a person or group (other than an inquiry, proposal or offer by Parent or any of
its subsidiaries) structured to permit the person or group to acquire or purchase, directly or indirectly, in any single or multi-step transaction or series of related transactions, at
least (i) 15% of the (A) consolidated assets (including our subsidiaries' capital stock), revenues or earnings of us and our subsidiaries taken as a whole or (B) total voting power
of our capital stock or (ii) 15% of our and our subsidiaries' assets, revenues or earnings taken as a whole, through any merger, consolidation, other business combination, sale of
shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer, exchange offer, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution of us or any of our subsidiaries.

        From March 30, 2017 until the Effective Time, we, our subsidiaries and our representatives may not, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, facilitate, initiate or knowingly encourage or induce any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes a Competing Proposal or that is reasonably likely to lead
to a Competing Proposal; 

• enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any information or data with respect to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, a Competing Proposal; 

• approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Competing Proposal; 

• enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent, term sheet, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement) providing for or facilitating or endorsing a Competing Proposal, or any contract, agreement or
arrangement requiring that we abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; or 

• furnish any information relating to us or any of our subsidiaries to any person, or to allow any person access to our business, properties, assets, books, records or
other information, or to any of our personnel or our subsidiaries' personnel (in each case, other than Parent, its and our affiliates and representatives of the parties
and their affiliates).

non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, as summarized above) before receiving stockholder approval of the Merger

Proposal, we may contact the party making the proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof. If the Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as
described below), or if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that the Competing Proposal would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, we may (i) furnish non-public information to the person making the Competing Proposal if the person executes an acceptable
confidentiality agreement and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with the person making the Competing Proposal; provided that if we furnish such information or engage
in such discussions, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 48 hours) after taking such actions, we must notify Parent in writing of such Superior
Proposal or the determination of the Board that the Competing Proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and provide Parent any information
concerning us or our subsidiaries not previously provided to Parent. We must also, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 48 hours) following the receipt
of any written Competing Proposal, provide Parent with the material terms of such Competing Proposal (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements) and the identity of the person making such Competing Proposal, unless disclosing the identify or such person is prohibited by the terms of
a confidentiality agreement with such person. Additionally, we must keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours of any
material development) of the status and details (including amendments) of any such Competing Proposal and provide Parent any documents describing or evidencing such
Competing Proposal.

        A "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Competing Proposal in which each reference to "15%" in the definition of "Competing Proposal" is deemed to be a
reference to "50%," and that the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with our financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors as it considers to be
appropriate, (i) is more favorable from a financial point of view to us and our stockholders than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including any
adjustment to the terms and conditions offered in writing by Parent in response to such a proposal or otherwise, and including any break-up fees and expense reimbursement
provisions) and (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms.

        Furthermore, at any time before receiving stockholder approval of the Merger Proposal, the Board may, if it determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with the proper exercise of its fiduciary duties to our stockholders, cause the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement
if it has received a Superior Proposal and, concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement, it enters into a definitive agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal,
and pays the termination fee described under "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by the Company." If we terminate the Merger Agreement in this manner, we
must comply with certain terms of the Merger Agreement, including providing 72-hour notice of a prospective termination to Parent and in good faith negotiating, during such
72-hour period, adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Guarantee, as applicable, so that the Competing
Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal prior to entering into a definitive agreement with respect to the Competing Proposal, and then further providing an
additional 48-hour notice and such negotiation rights during such 48-hour period upon any changes in the financial or other material terms of such Competing Proposal.

        In addition, at any time before receiving stockholder approval of the Merger Proposal, the Board may, if it determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)
that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with the proper exercise of its fiduciary duties to our stockholders: (i) withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or propose
publicly to do so, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or make any statement or proposal inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in this proxy statement, (iii) following written request by Parent in the event where Parent may make such a request, fail to

reaffirm publicly the Company Board Recommendation within five business days or (iv) resolve, agree or propose to take any of such actions, so long as, with respect to each of
clauses (i) through (iv), we comply with certain terms of the Merger Agreement, including by providing notice to Parent (including a reasonably detailed description of the facts
and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event (as described below)) and in good faith negotiating adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter and the Guarantee, as applicable, under the same provisions, notice periods and negotiation rights of Parent that are applicable in connection with a
Superior Proposal (as described in the paragraph immediately above) as if such requirements related to an Intervening Event instead of a Superior Proposal, to, following the
occurrence of an Intervening Event.

        An "Intervening Event" means any change, effect, development, circumstance, condition, state of facts, event or occurrence (other than resulting from our material breach of
the Merger Agreement) that was not known to the Board as of or prior to March 30, 2017, and becomes known to the Board prior to stockholder approval of the Merger Proposal;
provided that the fact that we meet or exceed any internal or published forecasts or projections for any period, or any change after March 30, 2017, in market price or trading
volume of our common stock, will not constitute and will not be taken into account in determining the existence of an Intervening Event (but the underlying reasons for each
such event or change may constitute, and may be taken into account in determining whether there has been or there exists, an Intervening Event).

        We are also prohibited from taking any action to exempt any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) from the restrictions on "business
combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar provision of applicable law), unless in connection with a valid termination of the Merger Agreement to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal.

Special Meeting of Our Stockholders 

        The Merger Agreement requires that, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of the Merger Agreement, we convene and hold a special meeting of our
stockholders for the initial purpose of obtaining stockholder approval of the Merger Proposal, and that we use our reasonable best efforts to cause the meeting to occur as soon as
reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than 35 calendar days following (a) the 10th calendar day after we have filed our preliminary proxy statement with the SEC (or
if such date is not a business day, the next succeeding business day) if the SEC has not informed us by such date that it intends to review the proxy statement or (b) if by such
10th calendar day, the SEC has informed us that it intends to review the proxy statement, the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the proxy
statement). We may only adjourn or postpone the special meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the proxy statement is
provided to our stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the special meeting, (ii) if as of the time for which the special meeting is originally scheduled
there are insufficient shares of our common stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the special meeting or
(iii) with Parent's written consent.

        The Board has recommended that our stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement and has included that recommendation in this proxy statement. Except as permitted
in the Merger Agreement, as discussed above under "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals," beginning on page 71, the Board will continue to
recommend that our stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain stockholder approval of the Merger
Agreement. Notwithstanding any change in recommendation by the Board, unless the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Merger Agreement will
be submitted

to our stockholders of record at the special meeting for the purpose of adopting the Merger Agreement.

Efforts to Obtain Regulatory Approval 

        The Merger Agreement requires us, Parent and Merger Sub to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law or otherwise
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the Outside Date. Without limiting the foregoing,
we have each agreed to use reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly make any and all required applications and filings under the HSR Act and take other actions to cause the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, (ii) avoid any action or proceeding by a governmental entity (including those required with
respect to the HSR Act) in connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger (including, in the case of Parent, by agreeing to sell, lease,
license or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition, any assets, rights, product lines, licenses, categories of assets or businesses or other operations, or
interests therein, of the Company, Parent or any of our or their respective subsidiaries, and promptly to effect such transaction and to enter into agreements with, and submission
to orders of, the relevant government entity giving effect thereto), (iii) comply at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any request under or with respect to the HSR Act
and any other applicable laws for additional information, documents or other materials received by us, Parent or any of our or their respective subsidiaries from the FTC or DOJ
or any other governmental entity in connection with any such applications or filings or the Merger, and (iv) coordinate and cooperate with, and give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by, the other party in connection with, making any filing under or with respect to the HSR Act or any other applicable laws
and any filings, conferences or other submissions related to resolving any investigation or other inquiry by any governmental entity. As previously noted, on April 25, 2017, the
FTC granted early termination of the 30-day waiting period under the HSR Act, with respect to the Merger. The grant of early termination has the effect of satisfying the HSR
Act condition under the Merger Agreement.

Financing Cooperation; Marketing Period; Related Indemnification 

Cooperation

        The Merger is not subject to a financing condition. Subject to certain customary exceptions, we have agreed to, agreed to cause our subsidiaries to, and agreed to use
reasonable best efforts to require our and their representatives to, provide Parent with customary and necessary cooperation as reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub to
assist them in arranging the debt financing to be obtained in connection with the Merger, including, among several other actions, (i) assisting with the preparation of
presentations, road show materials and offering documents and other documents for use in connection with such financing, (ii) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with
certain financial information regarding us and our subsidiaries, including certain financial statements and pro forma financial information for use in connection with the financing
and (iii) assisting Parent and Merger Sub in obtaining corporate and facilities ratings in connection with such financing.

Marketing Period

        Under the Merger Agreement, we have agreed to allow Parent a period of 20 consecutive business days (subject to customary "blackout" dates) to market any debt financing
(the "Marketing Period"). The Marketing Period will begin after we have provided Parent with the financial and other information specified in the Merger Agreement and
necessary to satisfy the requirements of any debt commitment letter entered into in connection with such debt financing.

Table of Contents

        The Marketing Period will be deemed not to have commenced if after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the completion of the Marketing Period any of the
following events occurs (and, in each such case, the Marketing Period will restart when such event has ceased to exist):

• we announce an intention to restate any financial statements or financial information required to be included in the financial and other information required to be
provided to Parent; 

• our auditors withdraw, or advise us in writing that they intend to withdraw, any audit opinion issued with respect to our audited financial statements for our three
most recently completed fiscal years; 

• the information provided to Parent in connection with any proposed debt financing is no longer compliant in all material respects with the requirements of the
SEC's Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X for offerings of debt securities on Form S-1 (other than such provisions for which compliance is not customary in a
Rule 144A offering of high-yield debt securities); or 

• we fail to make any filings with the SEC within the time period required by the Exchange Act containing any financial information that is required to be contained
therein or incorporated by reference.

        Although the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger is not subject to a financing condition, the Merger Agreement provides that, without Parent's
agreement, the closing of the Merger will not occur earlier than the second business day after the expiration of the Marketing Period. See "The Merger—Closing and Effective
Time of the Merger" on page 59 for additional information.

Indemnification

        If the Merger Agreement is terminated, Parent has agreed to reimburse us promptly upon our request for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by us, our subsidiaries or representatives in connection with the cooperation described above, subject to certain specified exceptions. Merger Sub and Parent have also
agreed, in the event the closing of the Merger does not occur, on a joint and several basis, to indemnify us, our subsidiaries, our affiliates and our and their representatives against
losses suffered or incurred in connection with the financing and certain other actions taken by us, except to the extent such losses arise or result from actual and intentional fraud
of, or a willful breach of the Merger Agreement by, us, our subsidiaries and our representatives.

Payoff of Obligations under Credit Agreement 

        The Merger Agreement requires us to use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent, no later than two business days prior to the Effective Time, a copy of an executed
customary payoff letter with respect to all our outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement, so that such payoff is made immediately prior to, and subject to the
occurrence of, the closing of the Merger. As of March 31, 2017, we had approximately $63.4 million outstanding under our Credit Agreement, and we expect to have
approximately $57.0 million outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger.

Transaction Litigation 

        The Merger Agreement requires us to promptly (and in any event within two business days) notify Parent in writing of any litigation asserted or commenced by, on behalf of
or in the name of, against or otherwise involving us, the Board, any committee thereof, and/or any of our directors or officers related to the Merger Agreement, the Merger or
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis with respect to the status of the same. We will give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense, prosecution, settlement or compromise of any

such stockholder litigation and to consult with its counsel regarding the defense, prosecution, settlement or compromise of any such litigation.

Employee Benefits and Service Credit 

        From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the benefit plans and compensation arrangements and agreements
between us and our employees in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. Effective as of the Effective Time and for a period of no less
than one year thereafter, Parent will provide, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each of our employees who continues to be employed by us or the Surviving
Corporation or any subsidiary thereof (the "Continuing Employees"), (i) a base salary or regular hourly wage, whichever is applicable, that is not less than the base salary or
regular hourly wage provided by us to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cash bonus opportunity and cash incentive award compensation
opportunity, in each case, at substantially comparable levels provided by us to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance benefits no less
favorable than those provided under our plans as in effect at March 30, 2017, and disclosed to Parent, and (iv) employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided by us to such Continuing Employee (including their dependents) immediately prior to the Effective Time. Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent
will provide, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, that periods of employment with us (including any current or former affiliate or any predecessor thereof) will
be taken into account for purposes of determining, as applicable, the eligibility for participation and vesting of any Continuing Employee under all employee benefit plans
maintained by Parent or a subsidiary thereof for the benefit of the Continuing Employees, including vacation or other paid-time-off plans or arrangements, 401(k), pension or
other retirement plans and any severance or health and welfare plans.

        For the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) ensure that no eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work
requirements or pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions will apply with respect to the Continuing Employees under its or its subsidiaries' health benefits plans, including
those of the Surviving Corporation (except to the extent applicable under benefit plans immediately prior to the Effective Time), (ii) waive any and all evidence of insurability
requirements with respect to such Continuing Employees under any such health plan to the extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable to the
Continuing Employees under our benefits plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, out-of-pocket
or other co-payments paid by such Continuing Employee under our or our affiliates' health benefit plans prior to the closing of the Merger during the plan year in which the
closing of the Merger occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such Continuing Employee has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has
reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any of Parent's or its subsidiaries' health plans (including the Surviving Corporation) for such year. The Merger will not affect any
Continuing Employee's accrual of, or right to use, in accordance with our policy as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, any personal, sick, vacation or other paid-
time-off accrued but unused by such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will and will cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor thereto to (i) assume our and our subsidiaries' obligations under
the benefit plans, including all vested or accrued benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of our current and former employees (including any such obligations or rights
arising in connection with the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement), (ii) honor, fulfill and discharge such obligations in accordance with
their terms, and (iii) to the extent not paid prior to the closing of the Merger, pay, no later than the deadline set forth in the applicable bonus plan, to all of our employees who are
so employed as of the closing of the Merger bonuses under our bonus plans in effect for the fiscal year

ending on June 30, 2017, at no less than the actual amount of the bonus earned by and payable to each such employee pursuant to the applicable terms of such bonus plan. Parent
has acknowledged that a "change in control" or "change of control" (or the equivalent) will occur upon the Effective Time for purposes of all benefit plans.

        Until the end of the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor thereto to continue to maintain the
short-term disability and long-term disability benefit plans, policies, and programs maintained by us immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, at levels of coverage and
benefits and subject to terms and conditions that are no less favorable for any individual than the levels of coverage and benefits and the terms and conditions in effect as of
immediately prior to the closing of the Merger.

Conditions to the Merger 

        The respective obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
waiver, of the following conditions (the "General Closing Conditions"):

• adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon; 

• the absence of any statute, rule or regulation that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger; 

• the absence of any order or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction in effect that prevents the consummation of the Merger; and 

• expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) relating to the Merger under the HSR Act, which waiting period was terminated
by the FTC on April 25, 2017.

        The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger are also subject to the satisfaction (or waiver in writing by Parent) on or prior to the closing date of the
Merger of the following additional conditions (the "Company Closing Conditions"):

correct as of such date), except for de minimis inaccuracies; 

• our representations and warranties regarding our organization and qualification, authority to enter into the Merger Agreement, broker fees due in connection with

Termination of the Merger Agreement 

        We and Parent may, by mutual written agreement, terminate the Merger Agreement and abandon the Merger at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders.

        The Merger Agreement may also be terminated and the Merger abandoned, whether before or after the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, as follows:

• by either Parent or us, if: 

• the Effective Time has not occurred by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the Outside Date; provided that this termination right will not be available to (i) a party
whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the Merger Agreement has been the primary cause of the Effective Time
not occurring prior to the Outside Date and (ii) Parent during the pendency of any proceeding brought by us for specific performance of the Merger
Agreement; 

• a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that is within a jurisdiction material to our business and operations has issued a final, non-appealable
order, decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by the Merger Agreement; provided that this termination right will not be available to a party whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in the Merger Agreement has been the primary cause of the issuance of the order, decree or ruling; or 

• the Merger Agreement is not adopted by our stockholders at the special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, in each case at which a
vote on such adoption was taken; provided that this termination right will not be available to us if we breach any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in the Merger Agreement, and such breach has been the primary cause of our failure to obtain stockholder approval at the special meeting or at
any adjournment or postponement thereof. 

• by us, if: 

• prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the Merger Agreement,
and such breach would result in the General Closing Conditions or the Parent Closing Conditions not being satisfied and such breach is not curable prior to
the Outside Date, or if curable prior to the Outside Date, has not been cured within the earlier of 30 calendar days after the receipt of notice thereof from
us or three business days before the Outside Date; provided that this termination right will not be available to us if we are then in material breach of any of
our representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the Merger Agreement such that the General Closing Conditions or the Company Closing
Conditions would not be satisfied; or 

• prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, the Board (or any committee thereof) has received a Superior Proposal and has
determined in good faith (after consulting with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to accept such Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties, we have complied in all material respects with our obligations with respect to solicitations of Competing
Proposals and we enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal simultaneously with the termination of the Merger Agreement
and pay to Parent the termination fee (as described in "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee Payable by the Company," beginning on page 81),
concurrently with such termination.

such breach is not curable prior to the Outside Date, or if curable prior to the Outside Date, it has not been cured within the earlier of 30 calendar days
after the receipt of notice thereof from Parent or three business days before the Outside Date; provided that this termination right will not be available if
Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the Merger Agreement such that the
General Closing Conditions or the Parent Closing Conditions would not be satisfied; or

• prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, (i) there occurs a Change of Recommendation or (ii) we otherwise breach our
obligations with respect to solicitations of Competing Proposals, as described in "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals,"
beginning on page 71; provided that the exercise of this termination right by Parent must occur within 10 business days of the Change of Recommendation
in the case of (i) or within 10 business days following the date Parent first becomes aware of the breach in the case of (ii).

Termination Fee Payable by the Company 

        We will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of approximately $19.4 million (the "termination fee") if the Merger Agreement is terminated under the following
circumstances:

• prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, 

• Parent terminates the Merger Agreement in a timely manner because (i) of a Change of Recommendation or (ii) we otherwise breach our obligations with
respect to solicitations, as described in "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Competing Proposals"; or 

• we terminate the Merger Agreement because the Board (or any committee thereof) has received a Superior Proposal and has determined in good faith
(after consulting with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to accept the Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties, we have complied in all material respects with our obligations with respect to solicitations of Competing Proposals, and
simultaneously with the termination of the Merger Agreement, we enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal and pay the
termination fee to Parent concurrently with such termination.

        In addition, we are required to pay the termination fee if:

• (i) we or Parent terminate the Merger Agreement because the Effective Time has not occurred by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the Outside Date (but in the case of a
termination by us, only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating the Merger Agreement if its breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement has been the primary cause of the Effective Time not occurring prior to the Outside Date), (ii) we or Parent terminate the Merger
Agreement because our stockholders do not adopt the Merger Agreement; or (iii) Parent terminates the Merger Agreement because we have breached any of our
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the Merger Agreement, and such breach results in any of the General Closing Conditions or the Company
Closing Conditions not being satisfied and the breach is not curable prior to the Outside Date, or if curable prior to the Outside Date, it has not been cured within
the earlier of 30 calendar days after the receipt of notice thereof from Parent or three business days before the Outside Date; 

• any person has publicly disclosed a bona fide Competing Proposal after March 30, 2017 and prior to such termination and such Competing Proposal has not been
publicly withdrawn prior to such termination; and

Table of Contents

• during the period commencing on March 30, 2017 and ending 12 months following such termination, we enter into a definitive agreement providing for a
Competing Proposal (which Competing Proposal is subsequently consummated, whether during or following such 12-month period) or consummate a transaction
contemplated by such Competing Proposal; provided that each reference to 15% in the definition of "Competing Proposal" will be deemed to be a reference to
"50%."

        In no event will we be required to pay the termination fee on more than one occasion. If we fail to pay the termination fee, should it become due, in a timely manner, and
Parent commences a proceeding that results in a final non-appealable judgment in its favor, we will pay Parent's reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such proceeding, together with interest accruing from the date such payment was required to be made until the actual
date of payment, at a rate per annum equal to the prime interest rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such interest begins accruing.

Expenses 

        All reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
will be paid by the party incurring such expenses, except that Parent has agreed to pay, whether or not the Merger or any other transaction is consummated, all expenses incurred
in connection with (i) any filing with antitrust authorities or in connection with required governmental approvals and (ii) the Paying Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Parent has agreed to pay the amount of any documentary, sales, use, real property transfer, transfer, stamp, recording and other similar taxes, together
with any interest thereon, penalties, fines, costs or fees with respect thereto incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (other
than transfer and other similar taxes payable by a third person in connection with the transfer of a share certificate).

Remedies 

        No termination of the Merger Agreement will relieve any party to the Merger Agreement of any liability to the other parties resulting from its actual and intentional fraud or
for any willful breach of its covenants and agreements in the Merger Agreement. Prior to termination of the Merger Agreement, the non-breaching party will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement.

        The parties have agreed that Parent's right to receive the termination fee is not a penalty, but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount to compensate Parent and
Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such termination fee is due and payable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, Parent's right to receive
payment of the termination fee (together with certain amounts due in connection therewith, such as reasonable out-of-pocket costs to enforce payment of the termination fee)
from us will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, its subsidiaries, the Equity Investor, any of Parent's financing sources, or any of their respective former, current or future
directors, officers, partners, stockholders, equityholders, controlling persons, managers, members, affiliates, agents or other representatives for the loss suffered as a result of the
failure of the Merger to be consummated. Under circumstances where the termination fee is due, upon our payment of the termination fee and any amounts due in connection
therewith, none of us, any of our subsidiaries or any of our or their respective former, current or future directors, officers, partners, stockholders, equityholders, controlling
persons, managers, members, affiliates, agents or other representatives will have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of the Merger Agreement or the
Merger.

        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, the collective monetary damages payable by Parent, its subsidiaries, the Equity Investor, any of Parent's
financing sources, or any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, partners, stockholders, equityholders, controlling persons, managers, members, affiliates,
agents or other representatives as a result of breaches under the Merger Agreement, the Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter will not exceed an amount equal to
$38.76 million in the aggregate for all such breaches (except for our rights to be reimbursed by Parent for expenses as described in "The Merger Agreement—Expenses," on
page 82, and our rights to be indemnified by Parent for any costs, expenses or losses in connection with the debt financing, as described in "The Merger Agreement—Financing
Cooperation; Marketing Period; Related Indemnification," beginning on page 75, none of which shall be subject to such cap, other than in the case of the Guarantee).

        The limitations above, however, do not limit the right of a party to bring or maintain a legal proceeding (i) for an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to
the extent otherwise permitted in the Merger Agreement, unless and until the Merger Agreement has been terminated and we have paid the termination fee to Parent in
accordance with the Merger Agreement and (ii) against the other parties to the Merger Agreement or their affiliates arising out of or in connection with a breach of the
confidentiality agreement between us and Parent; provided that the Merger Agreement does not permit us to receive both monetary damages and a grant of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance 

        For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor thereof to, indemnify and hold harmless (and
Parent or the Surviving Corporation will, subject to repayment under certain limited circumstances, advance expenses to) our directors, officers and other employees who were
subject to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses under our governing documents or indemnification agreements (collectively, the "Covered Persons"). The
indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will apply with respect to any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, arising out of or pertaining to any
action or omission or alleged act or omission in a Covered Person's capacity as our director, officer or employee, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby,
to the fullest extent permitted by law. For a period of six years after the Effective Time, and except as required by law, the governing documents of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions related to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons no less favorable than the corresponding provisions in our governing
documents.

        We are required to (and if we are unable to do so, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) obtain a six-year "tail" insurance policy with respect to our currently
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policies and fiduciary and employment practices liability insurance policies. This policy must be obtained from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as our insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance and must have
benefits and levels of coverage that are at least as favorable as our existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; provided that in
no event will we expend in the aggregate an annual premium for such policies in excess of 300% of the annual premiums that we are currently paying for such insurance.

        If we and the Surviving Corporation fail to purchase such policies, then the Surviving Corporation has agreed, and Parent has agreed to cause the Surviving Corporation, to
continue to maintain the policies in place as of March 30, 2017, with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as in our policies of as March 30, 2017, or to use
reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable policies, in

each case, for the six-year period following the Effective Time. In no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in the aggregate for such policies an
annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium amount we were paying for such insurance as of March 30, 2017. If the annual premium amount for such
coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation must obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost that does not exceed such amount.

        Covered Persons have certain third party beneficiary rights under the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to their indemnification.

Modification and Amendment of Merger Agreement 

        Subject to applicable law and except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, the parties to the Merger Agreement may agree in writing to modify, amend or
supplement the Merger Agreement before or after adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders. Following adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders,
however, the parties will not be permitted to amend the Merger Agreement in a manner requiring stockholder approval without obtaining further stockholder approval for the
amendment. In addition, a modification, waiver or termination of certain limited provisions of the Merger Agreement will also require the prior written consent of the financing
sources in connection with any debt financing (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the extent the modification, waiver or termination is
adverse in any material respect to those financing sources.

MERGER COMPENSATION ADVISORY VOTE 

        In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and SEC rules issued thereunder, our stockholders may cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve compensation that
may be paid or become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as disclosed in the table entitled "Potential Change in Control Payments to Named
Executive Officers" on page 57, under "The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation," including the
footnotes to the table and the related narrative section.

        At the special meeting, the following resolution will be submitted to a non-binding, advisory vote of our stockholders:

RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers, in connection with the Merger, and the agreements
or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the table
in the section entitled "Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation—Potential Change in Control Payments to
Named Executive Officers" and the footnotes thereto and related narrative section, are hereby APPROVED.

Vote Required and Recommendation of the Board

        The vote on this proposal is a vote separate from the vote on the Merger Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote "FOR" the approval of the Merger Proposal and
"AGAINST" the Merger Compensation Proposal, and vice versa. Approval of the Merger Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of our common stock that are present at the special meeting, whether in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon. However, because the vote on the
Merger Compensation Proposal is advisory in nature, it will not be binding on us or on Parent. Approval of the Merger Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the closing of
the Merger, and the failure of our stockholders to approve the Merger Compensation Proposal will have no effect on the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Compensation to be
paid in connection with the Merger could still be payable, regardless of the outcome of this advisory vote, if the Merger Agreement is adopted (subject to the contractual
conditions applicable thereto).

        THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL, ON A NON-BINDING, ADVISORY BASIS, OF
THE MERGER COMPENSATION PROPOSAL.

ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        Our stockholders may be asked to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or time if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
adjournment to adopt the Merger Agreement. The vote on this proposal is separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Vote Required and Recommendation of the Board

        Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock present, in person or
represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on the matter at the special meeting. A vote on the Adjournment Proposal does not require the presence of a quorum.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER DELAWARE LAW 

        If the Merger is completed, our stockholders will be entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262"), provided that they comply with the
conditions established by Section 262.

        This section is intended to provide a brief summary of the material provisions of the Delaware statutory procedures that a stockholder must follow in order to seek and
perfect appraisal rights. However, this summary is not a complete statement of all applicable requirements, and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of Section 262,
which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that
stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Failure to follow precisely any of the statutory procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in a termination or
waiver of appraisal rights.

        A stockholder of record who makes the demand described below with respect to some or all of such stockholder's shares, who continuously holds such shares through the
Effective Time, who submits a written demand for appraisal to us and otherwise complies with the statutory requirements of Section 262, and who does not submit a proxy or
vote in favor of the Merger Proposal or consent thereto in writing will be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery, of the fair value of his, her or its shares of our
common stock in lieu of the Merger Consideration that such stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

        Because the Merger Agreement is to be submitted for adoption at the special meeting, Section 262 requires that we notify stockholders that appraisal rights will be available
at least 20 days prior to the meeting and include in such notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes our notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights
are available in connection with the Merger, and a copy of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C.

        Stockholders who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must satisfy all of the conditions of Section 262.

• A written demand for appraisal of shares of our common stock must be delivered to us before the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the special
meeting. This written demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder as well as the stockholder's intention to demand an appraisal of the
"fair value" of such stockholder's shares. A stockholder's failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger
Agreement at the special meeting will result in the loss of appraisal rights. 

• The written demand for appraisal of shares of our common stock must be in addition to and separate from a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal or an
abstention from such vote or failure to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal. If you sign and return a proxy card that does not contain voting instructions, or
submit a proxy by telephone or through the Internet that does not contain voting instructions, you will effectively waive your appraisal rights because such shares
represented by the proxy will, unless the proxy is revoked, be voted for the Merger Proposal. Accordingly, stockholders electing to exercise their appraisal rights
must not vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal. A proxy or vote marked "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" as to the Merger Proposal in and of itself will not constitute a
written demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262. 

• A demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the stockholder of record, fully and correctly, and must state that the person intends to demand appraisal of his,
her or its shares in connection with the Merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand
must be executed by or for the fiduciary. If the shares of our common stock are owned by or for more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or

Table of Contents

tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute
the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify such record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in
exercising the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A person having a beneficial interest in our common stock held of record in the
name of another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the holder of record to follow the steps summarized herein in a timely manner to
perfect whatever appraisal rights the beneficial owner may have. A holder of record who holds shares as nominee for several beneficial owners may exercise
appraisal rights with respect to the shares of our common stock held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising such rights with respect to the shares
held for other beneficial owners; in such case, the written demand should set forth the number of shares as to which appraisal is sought. If the number of shares of
our common stock is not expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of the record owner. If our common stock is held
through a broker that in turn holds our common stock through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such
common stock must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as holder of record.

        A stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights should mail or otherwise deliver his, her or its written demand to TRC Companies, Inc., 21 Griffin Road North,
Windsor, Connecticut 06095, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

        Within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must provide notice of the Effective Time to all stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and
have not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal.

        Within 120 days after the Effective Time, either the Surviving Corporation or any stockholder who has complied with the required conditions of Section 262 may file a
petition in the Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of
the shares of our common stock held by all stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights. We have no present intent to file an appraisal petition, and stockholders seeking to
exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the Surviving Corporation will file such a petition or that we or the Surviving Corporation will initiate any negotiations with
respect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly, stockholders who desire to have their shares of our common stock appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the
perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262.

        Failure to file a petition for appraisal within the time period specified in Section 262 will result in a loss of appraisal rights.

        Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder who has satisfied the applicable requirements of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from
us a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of our common stock not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal and with respect to which we received demands for
appraisal and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within 10 days after the stockholder's request has been received by the Surviving
Corporation or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for the delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later.

        If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days
after such service, to file in the Office of the Register in Chancery (the "Register"), a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have
demanded an appraisal of their shares of our common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of such shares have not been reached. The Register, if ordered by the
Court of Chancery, shall provide notice of the time and place fixed for a hearing on the

petition by registered or certified mail to the Surviving Corporation and to the stockholders shown on such list. At the hearing, the Court of Chancery will determine which
stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights. The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares of our common stock and who
hold such stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. In the case of the Merger, the Court of Chancery will dismiss the
proceedings as to all holders of our shares who would be otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for appraisal or (b) the value of the Merger Consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares exceeds
$1 million.

        Where proceedings are not dismissed, the Court of Chancery will appraise the shares of our common stock owned by such stockholders, determining the fair value of such
shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to
be the fair value. When the fair value has been determined, the Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value upon surrender by those stockholders of the certificates
representing their shares of our common stock. Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, except as described below, interest
from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. However, at any time before the entry of
judgment, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter as provided herein only
upon the sum of (a) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery and (b) interest theretofore accrued,
unless paid at that time.

        Although the Board believes that the consideration being provided to our stockholders in connection with the Merger is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of
the appraisal of fair value as would be determined by the Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value
higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Moreover, we do not anticipate offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising
appraisal rights and reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the fair value of a share of our common stock is less than the Merger
Consideration. In determining fair value, the Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this
determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which could be
ascertained as of the date of the merger which shed any light on the future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger." The Delaware Supreme Court has held that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion that does not
encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. Indeed, "elements of
future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered."
In addition, Delaware courts have held that the statutory appraisal remedy, depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenting stockholder's exclusive remedy.

        The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Court of Chancery and imposed upon the dissenting stockholder(s) and/or the Surviving Corporation as the
Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Each dissenting stockholder is responsible for his, her or its

attorneys' and expert witness fees and expenses, although, upon application of a dissenting stockholder, the Court of Chancery may order that all or a portion of the expenses
incurred by any dissenting stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts,
be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of our common stock entitled to appraisal.

        At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party will have
the right to withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and to accept the Merger Consideration by delivering to us a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. After this
period, a stockholder may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and receive payment for his, her or its shares as provided in the Merger Agreement only with the written
consent of the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Court of Chancery as to any stockholder
who commenced or joined such proceeding as a named party, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court of Chancery deems just. If we do not approve
a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or if the Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding when that
dismissal is required, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be more or less than, or
equal to, the Merger Consideration. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Court of Chancery within 120 days after the Effective Time, a stockholder's rights to appraisal (if
available) will cease and he, she or it will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for his, her or its shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement as if he, she or it had not
demanded appraisal of his, her or its shares. Inasmuch as neither we nor the Surviving Corporation have any obligation to file such a petition, any stockholder who desires a
petition to be filed is advised to file it on a timely basis.

        Failure by any stockholder to comply fully with the procedures described above and set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of such stockholder's appraisal rights. In
view of the complexity of exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL, any stockholder considering exercising these rights should consult with its legal counsel.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 

        The following table sets forth information as of May 8, 2017 regarding the beneficial ownership of common stock by:

• each director; 

• each named executive officer identified in the section of this proxy statement titled "Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden
Parachute Compensation," beginning on page 56; and 

• all of our directors and executive officers as a group.

        As of May 8, 2017, 31,628,280 shares of our common stock were outstanding. The number of shares beneficially owned by each stockholder is determined under rules
promulgated by the SEC. The information does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a
person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to options or other convertible securities or rights held by that person that are currently
exercisable or will become exercisable on or before July 7, 2017 (60 days after May 8, 2017), are deemed to be currently outstanding. These shares, however, are not deemed
outstanding for the purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

        Unless otherwise noted below:

• the address for each beneficial owner in the table below is c/o TRC Companies, Inc., 21 Griffin Road North, Windsor, Connecticut 06095; and 

• subject to applicable community property laws, to our knowledge, each person named in the tables below has sole voting and dispositive power over the shares
shown as beneficially owned by that person.

HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 

        To reduce the expense of delivering duplicate sets of proxy materials to multiple stockholders sharing the same address, the SEC permits companies to use a procedure
called "householding." Under the householding procedure, stockholders of record who have the same address will receive only one set of proxy materials, unless one or more of
the stockholders at that address has previously notified us that they want to receive separate copies. However, each 401(k) plan participant will continue to receive a copy of all of
the proxy materials.

        Under the SEC's householding rules, intermediaries also may deliver a single copy of the proxy materials to two or more stockholders that share the same address. If you
and other residents at your mailing address own shares of common stock in street name through an intermediary, you may have received a notice that your household will be sent
only one copy of the proxy materials. If you did not provide your intermediary with notice that you object to this householding, you may have been deemed to have consented to
the householding of information.

        Regardless of how you own your shares, if you received a single set of proxy materials as a result of householding, and one or more stockholders at your address would like
to have separate copies of these materials with respect to the special meeting or in the future, please contact American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, our transfer agent, using
the following contact information:

American Stock Transfer & Trust Company
6201 15th Avenue
Brooklyn, New York 11219-9821
(866) 254-6502

        American Stock Transfer & Trust Company will deliver the requested materials promptly to you. If you own your shares in street name, your notification should include the
name of your intermediary and your account number.

        If you are a stockholder of record of our common stock who is receiving multiple copies of our stockholder communications at your address and you would like to receive
only one copy for your household, please contact American Stock Transfer & Trust Company. If you own your shares in street name, please contact your intermediary. To enable
us to provide better stockholder service, we encourage stockholders to have all the shares they hold of record registered in the same name and under the same address.

SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        If the Merger is completed, we will no longer have public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of our stockholders. However, if the

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

AGREEMENT 

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER 

        Section 1.1    The Merger.     

        (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Company and
Merger Sub shall consummate the Merger pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall thereupon cease, (ii) the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the DGCL, and (iii) the Merger shall
have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The corporation surviving the Merger is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation."

        (b)   At the Effective Time, the Company Charter shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety so as to read in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B, and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C.

        Section 1.2    Closing.     The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, at the offices of Covington & Burling LLP, The New York
Times Building, 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York, 10018, no later than the third (3rd) business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth
in Article VII to be satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing), unless another time, date or place is agreed by the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the
"Closing Date." Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), then the Closing shall occur
instead on the date following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) that is the earlier to occur of
(a) any business day during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than two (2) business days' prior notice to the Company and (b) the second (2nd)
business day following the final day of the Marketing Period.

        Section 1.3    Effective Time.     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause an appropriate certificate of merger
or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed and filed on the Closing Date (or on such other date as Parent and the Company
may agree) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time such Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed with, and accepted by, the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or such other date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time."
From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all rights, privileges, powers and

property of the Company and Merger Sub, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

        Section 1.4    Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.     The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective
Time, be appointed as the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time,
shall continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

        Section 1.5    Subsequent Actions.     If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any
deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by
the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments
and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest,
perfect or confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

ARTICLE II 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

        Section 2.1    Conversion of Capital Stock.     At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

        (a)    Conversion of Common Stock.    Each share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock" or "Capital Stock" and each
such share, a "Share") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than
Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive in cash an amount per Share (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to $17.55,
without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor
upon the surrender of such Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest thereon.

        (b)    Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Common Stock.    All Shares owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall be automatically canceled
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

        (c)    Merger Sub Common Stock.    Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time (the
"Merger Sub Common Stock") shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing Merger Sub Common
Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of

Table of Contents

common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

        (d)    Adjustment to Merger Consideration.    The applicable Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Capital Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that nothing
in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any other Person to take any action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms
of this Agreement.

        Section 2.2    Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.     

        (a)    Paying Agent.    Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall designate a reputable bank or trust company, which shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Company, to act as the payment agent in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent"). Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration with respect to Shares converted into the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) (the "Exchange Fund"). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.1(a), Parent shall, or shall
cause Merger Sub to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such
payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
the Surviving Corporation on the earlier of one year after the Effective Time or full payment of the Exchange Fund.

        (b)    Procedures for Surrender.    As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than two (2) business days after the Effective Time),
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail (and make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates") or non-certificated Shares represented by
book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") and, in each case, whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (each, a "Letter of Transmittal") and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents reasonably acceptable to the Company as may be appointed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant

Table of Contents

to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder) within five
(5) business days following the later to occur of (A) the Effective Time or (B) the Paying Agent's receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (1) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (2) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate and Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this
Article II, without interest thereon.

        (c)    Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares.    At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

        (d)    Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability.    At any time beginning on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not
been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agent's routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares), and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

        (e)    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.    In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 2.1; provided that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may

reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

        Section 2.3    Dissenting Shares.     

        (a)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to,
but did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares ("Dissenting Shares")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Appraisal Rights") shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights (it being understood that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the appraised value of such
Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by the Appraisal Rights); provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's
Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and a Letter
of Transmittal, in each case in accordance with Section 2.2.

        (b)   The Company shall give prompt written notice (with email from counsel being sufficient) to Parent and Merger Sub of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of any Shares, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to
Appraisal Rights, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, withdrawals
or attempted withdrawals of such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent and Merger Sub, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

        Section 2.4    Treatment of Company Equity Awards.     

        (a)   Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to in writing between a holder of Company Options and Parent, (i) each outstanding,
unvested and unexercised option to purchase Shares (the "Company Options") under any Company Equity Plan shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full,
and (ii) each Company Option that remains outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including each Company Option that becomes
vested and exercisable pursuant to clause (i)) shall be canceled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such canceled Company Option shall be entitled to receive,
in consideration of the cancelation of such Company Option and in settlement thereof, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (A) the total number of
Shares for which such Company Option remains outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Company Option (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Option Consideration").
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the exercise price per share under any Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company
Option shall be canceled as of the Effective Time without payment therefor and shall have no further force or effect. The Option Consideration shall be paid by the
Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than its first payroll date

that is at least five (5) business days after the Closing. From and after the Effective Time, any such canceled Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former
holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment of the Option Consideration.

        (b)   Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to in writing between a holder of any Restricted Awards and Parent, all outstanding
restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance stock units (the "Restricted Awards") under any Company Equity Plan shall become immediately vested
(and, in the case of performance stock units, such vesting will be in the amounts corresponding to actual achievement of applicable performance goals applicable thereto,
which, in the event that the Closing shall occur prior to June 30, 2017, will be determined in good faith by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board of
Directors by assuming achievement of performance goals for any period of the applicable performance period that has not been completed as of the Closing (the "Open
Performance Period") taking into consideration historical levels of the Company's performance with respect to the applicable performance goals during the period of time
corresponding to the Open Performance Period) and all restrictions thereupon shall lapse, and such Restricted Awards shall be canceled in exchange for the right to
receive, with respect to each Share for which such Restricted Award remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, which shall
be paid by the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than its first payroll date that is at least five (5) business
days after the Closing. From and after the Effective Time, any such canceled Restricted Award shall only entitle the former holder thereof to the payment of the Merger
Consideration.

        (c)   The Company shall take all necessary corporate actions (including the passing of appropriate resolutions of the Company Board of Directors or any committee
thereof) to effectuate the treatment of the Company Options and Restricted Awards (collectively, the "Company Equity Awards") as contemplated by this Section 2.4.

        Section 2.5    Additional Payment Matters; Withholding.     All amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.4 shall be paid without interest (unless otherwise noted). Any
payments made pursuant to Section 2.4 shall be net of all applicable withholding Taxes that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may
be, shall be required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation and remitted to the
appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

        (b)   Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination, opinion or advisory letter from the Internal
Revenue Service and, to the knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualification or tax exemption of
any such Benefit Plan. Except as has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, each
Benefit Plan and any related trust complies in all respects, and has been maintained, funded and administered in compliance in all respects, with ERISA, the Code, and
other applicable Laws and with any applicable collective bargaining agreements. There are no Legal Proceedings or audits (other than routine claims for benefits) pending

"complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (as such terms are respectively defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA) for which liability is or could be
outstanding (whether or not assessed). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is party to any agreement intended to comply with Section 4204 of ERISA.

Section 414 of the Code with any Person other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(ii) increase any compensation or benefits otherwise payable under any Benefit Plan, (iii) accelerate the time of payment, funding, or vesting of any compensation or
benefits due to any Participant under any Benefit Plan or (iv) give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible by the Company, Parent, or any of their
respective affiliates by reason of Section 280G of the Code or any amount that could, individually or in combination with any other such payment, constitute an "excess
parachute payment", as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

        (f)    None of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and any of their respective affiliates has any obligation to "gross-up" or otherwise indemnify any individual

(with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite corporate or other power, as the case
may be, and authority to conduct its business as now being conducted, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, would not impair or delay in any material respect the ability of each of Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

        Section 4.2    Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary Action.     Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and

Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and no other corporate action on the part of either Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company, is the valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against
each of them in accordance with its terms, except that the enforcement hereof may be limited by Enforceability Exceptions.

        Section 4.3    Consents and Approvals; No Violations.     None of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, the consummation by

result in any breach of any provision of the organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub, (b) require any filing by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with, or the obtaining of

other Required Governmental Approvals or (iv) such filings with the SEC as may be required on behalf of Merger Sub and Parent in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger), (c) result in a modification, violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default or result in the creation of any Liens, or give
rise to any right, including any right of termination, amendment, cancelation or acceleration, under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material contract to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (d) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Parent or Merger Sub, any of their
Subsidiaries, or any of their properties or assets; except in each of clauses (b), (c) or (d) where (A) any failure to obtain such permits, authorizations, consents or approvals,
(B) any failure to make such filings or (C) any such modifications, violations, rights, Liens, breaches or defaults would not, individually or in the aggregate, impair or delay in
any material respect the ability of each Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement, as the case may be, or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

        Section 4.4    Litigation.     As of the date hereof, there is no Legal Proceeding pending against (or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against or naming as a party
thereto) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Parent, is there any audit, inquiry or investigation of a Governmental Entity pending or threatened against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction, award or decree, in each case, which would,
individually or in the aggregate, impair or delay in any material respect the ability of each of Parent and Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement, as the case
may be, or prevent the consummation of any of the Transactions.

        Section 4.5    Information in the Proxy Statement.     None of the information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any affiliate or Representative of Parent or Merger Sub,
expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) will, on the date of filing with the SEC, at the
time the Proxy Statement is first mailed and at the time of the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
makes any representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by any other Person that is included in the Proxy Statement.

        Section 4.6    Ownership of Company Capital Stock.     Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective affiliates is, nor at any time during the last three (3) years has
been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

        Section 4.7    Sufficient Funds.     

        (a)   Parent has delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of the executed Equity Commitment Letter from a certain Person (the "Equity Investor")
relating to the commitment of the Equity Investor to provide cash equity in the aggregate amount set forth therein for the purpose of funding the Transactions (the "Equity
Financing"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to provide until such time as this Agreement and/or the Equity Commitment Letter is terminated,
that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof as set forth therein.

        (b)   As of the date hereof: (i) the Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect or
otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect; (ii) the Equity Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Merger Sub, Parent, and the
Equity Investor; (iii) except for the Equity Commitment Letter delivered to the Company, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements relating
to the Equity Financing or the Equity Commitment Letter that could affect the amount, availability or conditionality of the Equity Financing, to which Merger Sub,
Parent, or any of their respective affiliates is a party; and (v) assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Merger Sub's and Parent's obligation to consummate the
Merger (pursuant to Section 7.1 and Section 7.2), to the knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to (A) constitute a default or breach on the part of Merger Sub, Parent or their respective affiliates with respect to the Equity Financing and
the Equity Investor under any term of the Equity Commitment Letter, (B) result in a failure of any condition of the Equity Commitment Letter, or (C) result in any portion
of the Equity Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger (pursuant to
Section 7.1 and Section 7.2) and the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in Article III and compliance with the covenants and obligations of
the Company under this Agreement, the aggregate net proceeds of the Equity Financing, together with available cash on hand at the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, will be sufficient for the satisfaction

required in connection therewith and the Expenses payable by Parent pursuant to Section 9.3) and the payment of all other amounts required to be paid by Parent and
Merger Sub in connection with the consummation of the Transactions. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Equity Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, assuming the satisfaction
of the conditions to Merger Sub's and Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger (pursuant to Section 7.1 and Section 7.2), neither Merger Sub nor Parent has any
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Equity Financing will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the Equity Financing will not be available to Merger
Sub on the date of the Closing.

        (c)   Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the limited guarantee of the Equity Investor with respect to certain
matters on the terms specified therein (the "Guarantee"). The Guarantee is in full force and effect (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the
Company) and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Equity Investor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions. No event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of, or a default under, the Guarantee on the part of the Equity Investor.

        Section 4.8    Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub.     Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, has engaged in no other business activities, has conducted its operations only as contemplated hereby, and has not
incurred any liabilities or other obligations (other than to the Company pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the consummation of the Transactions).

        Section 4.9    Brokers and Other Advisors.     No broker, investment banker, financial advisor, agent or other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's,
agent's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries.

affiliates or any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or their respective affiliates has entered into any contract, commitment, agreement, instrument, obligation,
arrangement, understanding or undertaking, whether written or oral, with any stockholder of the Company (where such stockholder has entered into such contract, commitment,
agreement, instrument, obligation, arrangement, understanding or undertaking in his or her or its capacity as a stockholder of the Company), including any "lock up" or similar
arrangements pertaining to the Capital Stock of the Company held by such stockholder.

        Section 4.11    No Agreements with Management.     Other than this Agreement, as of the date hereof, there are no contracts, commitments, agreements, instruments,
obligations, arrangements, understandings or undertakings, whether written or oral, between Parent or Merger Sub or any of their affiliates or Representatives, on the one hand,
and any member of the Company's management or the Company Board of Directors, on the other hand, relating in any way to the Transactions or the operations of the Company
after the Effective Time.

        Section 4.12    Solvency.     Neither Merger Sub nor Parent is entering into this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries. After giving effect to the Transactions, including the Financing, the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(a), all amounts to be paid pursuant to

the Transactions and to allow Merger Sub and Parent to perform all of their obligations under this Agreement, and assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Merger Sub's and
Parent's obligations to consummate the Merger and the accuracy of the representations and warranties in Article III and compliance with the covenants and obligations of the
Company under this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of and immediately after the Effective Time. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Solvent" means that, as of any date of determination and with respect to any Person: (a) the present "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, is greater than the total amount of "liabilities, including contingent liabilities," of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, as of such date,
(b) the present "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liability of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, on their existing debts and liabilities as they become absolute and matured (the quoted terms in clause (a)
and (b) as are generally determined in accordance with applicable federal or state Laws governing determination of insolvency of debtors), (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries,
on a consolidated basis, are not engaged in business, and are not about to engage in business, for which such Person's and its Subsidiaries' assets, on a consolidated basis, would
constitute unreasonably small capital, and (d) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, intend to, and believe that they will, pay their debts and liabilities as they
mature.

        Section 4.13    Investigation; Limitation on Warranties; Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties.     Each of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted its own
independent review and analysis of the business, operations, assets, intellectual property, technology, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and acknowledges that each of Parent and Merger Sub has been provided access to personnel, properties, premises and records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for such purposes. In entering into this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied solely upon its independent investigation
and analysis of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has not been induced by and has not relied upon
any representations, warranties or statements, whether express or implied, made by the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective affiliates, stockholders,
controlling persons or Representatives that are not expressly set forth in this Agreement, whether or not such representations, warranties or statements were made in writing or
orally. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III, (a) the Company does not make,
and has not made, any representations or warranties relating to itself or its business or otherwise in connection with the Merger and Parent and Merger Sub are not relying on any
representation or warranty except for those expressly set forth in Article III, (b) no Person has been authorized by the Company to make any representation or warranty relating to
itself or its business or otherwise in connection with the Merger, and if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub as having been
authorized by such party and (c) any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information provided or
addressed to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless any such materials or
information is the subject of any express representation or warranty set forth in Article III.

Competing Proposal), (E) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the Shares by a Person unaffiliated with Parent, fail to reaffirm the
Company Board Recommendation and recommend that the Company's stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within five (5) business days after the

Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof, and if such Competing Proposal (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) the Company Board of Directors

referred to in either of clause (A) or (B), in a Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following actions: (A) furnish non-public information to the Person making
such Competing Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from such Person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect to the Competing Proposal; provided that, as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) following the Company taking such actions as described in clauses (A) and (B) above, the Company shall (1) provide
written notice to Parent of such Superior Proposal or the determination of the Company Board of Directors as provided for in clause (ii) above, as applicable and
(2) provide to Parent any information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries provided to such Person which was not previously provided to Parent.

        (d)   The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) following the receipt of any written Competing
Proposal, provide Parent with the material terms of any such Competing Proposal (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements) and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Competing Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to
disclose the identity of the Person making such Competing Proposal if such disclosure is prohibited by the terms of a confidentiality agreement with such Person. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of any material development) of the status
and details (including amendments) of any such Competing Proposal and provide Parent with any documents describing or evidencing any such Competing Proposal.

        (e)   Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 5.2(a) and Section 5.2(b), at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board of Directors may, if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the proper exercise of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(h) (including payment of the applicable Company Termination Fee) and concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal; provided, however, that the Company Board of Directors may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.2(e) unless:

          (i)  the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance (the "Notice Period"), of its intention to
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions
of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal and substantially complete copies of all forms of agreements
with respect to such Superior Proposal);

         (ii)  prior to terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and its affiliates in good faith (to the extent Parent and its affiliates also have notified the
Company that they so seek to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and the
Guarantee, as applicable, so that the Competing Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

        (iii)  taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered in writing by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.2(e) as described
above, the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Company's outside legal and financial advisors that such Competing
Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal

(it being understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms of a Competing Proposal that was previously the subject of a notice
hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to any such subsequent notices, references herein to a "seventy-two (72) hours"
shall be deemed references to "forty-eight (48) hours").

        (f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.2(b), at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board of Directors may take any of the actions described in clauses (A), (C), (D) of Section 5.2(b)(i) or, solely for the purposes of such clauses (A), (C) and (D),
clause (F) of Section 5.2(b)(i) if, following the occurrence of an Intervening Event, (i) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the proper exercise of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law
and (ii) the Company Board of Directors shall have (A) first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to effect a Change of Recommendation, which
notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event, and (B) complied, as applicable, with the
requirements set forth in Section 5.2(e) as if such provisions related to an Intervening Event instead of a Superior Proposal.

        (g)   The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) from the restrictions on "business
combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar provision of applicable Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, or agree to do any of
the foregoing, in each case unless such actions are taken substantially concurrently with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h). Nothing contained in
this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board of Directors from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or
state Law with respect to a Competing Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or any other similar communication to stockholders or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (which shall be deemed to not constitute a Change of Recommendation); provided, however, that the
foregoing will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement, including whether there has
been a Change of Recommendation.

        Section 5.3    Proxy Statement.     The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, subject to providing Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such filing and giving good faith consideration to including any such reasonable comments provided by Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later
than fifteen (15) business days) after the date hereof, a preliminary Proxy Statement (the "Preliminary Proxy Statement") relating to the Merger as required by the Exchange Act.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act to be included in the Preliminary Proxy Statement. The

correspondence that may be received from the SEC or its staff or any other Governmental Entities with respect thereto, shall respond promptly to any such comments made by
the SEC or its staff or any other Governmental Entities with respect to the Preliminary Proxy Statement (after providing Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and

amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party, and an amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared by the Company and, after providing Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such amendment or supplement and giving good faith consideration to including any such reasonable comments
provided by Parent, filed with the SEC, and to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Except as Section 5.2 expressly permits,
the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, set a record date for the
Special Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith.

        Section 5.4    Stockholder Approval.     The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Special Meeting") for the initial purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval required in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event, such
meeting shall be held no later than 35 calendar days after (a) the tenth (10th) calendar day after the Preliminary Proxy Statement has been filed with the SEC (or if such date is
not a business day, the next succeeding business day) if by such date the SEC has not informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement or (b) if by such tenth
(10th) calendar day, the SEC has informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement, the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may only adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting (i) to the extent
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company's stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance
of the Special Meeting, (ii) if as of the time for which the Special Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient Shares represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Special Meeting or (iii) with Parent's written consent. Except as specifically permitted
by Section 5.2, the Company Board of Directors shall continue to recommend that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the agreement of merger (as such
term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the Requisite
Stockholder Approval. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company shall submit the agreement of merger contained in this
Agreement to its stockholders for adoption without regard to whether the Company Board of Directors has withdrawn, modified or qualified, or has publicly proposed to
withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation.

decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions
by any Governmental Entity;

         (ii)  the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make
consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful, or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or

and conferences.

        (c)   The Company shall agree, if requested by Parent, to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action with respect to the businesses, services,

violation of any applicable Law, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to contest, defend and resist any such action or proceeding, including any action or proceeding that seeks a temporary restraining order or preliminary
injunction that would prohibit, prevent or restrict consummation of the Transactions.

        (f)    Parent shall vote (or act by written consent with respect to) all of the shares of capital stock of Merger Sub beneficially owned by it in favor of the adoption of

announcement and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; provided that neither the Company nor Parent or Merger Sub

        Section 6.4    Directors' and Officers' Insurance and Indemnification.     

        (a)   Parent shall (to the extent required under the applicable Company Governing Documents as in effect on the date hereof), and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation (and any successor thereof) to, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law, under
the Company Governing Documents in effect on the date hereof and under any indemnification or other similar agreements in effect on the date hereof (the
"Indemnification Agreements") to the directors, officers and other employees of the Company covered by such Company Governing Documents or Indemnification
Agreements (the "Covered Persons") arising out of or relating to actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions.

        (b)   Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.4(a), for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation

undertaking by or on behalf of such Covered Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation of a Covered Person for which indemnification may be sought under this Section 6.4(b) unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of such Covered Person from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

        (c)   For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, except as required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons for periods prior to and including the
Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Governing Documents. The Indemnification Agreements with Covered Persons that survive the Merger shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, except as required by Law.

        (d)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to)
obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies (providing only for the Side A coverage for Covered Persons where the existing policies also include Side B coverage for
the Company) with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "D&O Insurance"), with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Company's existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or actions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that in no event shall the Company expend in the
aggregate for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company and
the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the D&O Insurance in place as of the date
of this Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year
period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that
in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in the aggregate for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and, provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

        (e)   In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case

other party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no
liability hereunder on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent Related Party, the Company or any Company Related Party, except that the Confidentiality Agreement,
Section 6.3, Section 6.14(c), Section 6.14(d), this Section 8.2, Section 8.3, and Section 9.3 through Section 9.13 shall survive such termination; provided that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for its actual and intentional fraud, or for Willful Breach of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.

        Section 8.3    Termination Fee; Limitation of Liability.     

        (a)   The Company shall be required to pay to Parent, or its designee, the Company Termination Fee in any of the following events (provided that in no event shall

        (iii)  (A) this Agreement is terminated by (1) Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) (but in the case of a termination by the Company, only if at
such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to the proviso to Section 8.1(b)), or (2) Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(d), or (3) Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e); (B) any Person shall have publicly disclosed a bona fide Competing Proposal after the date hereof and
prior to such termination and such Competing Proposal has not been publicly withdrawn prior to such termination; and (C) during the period commencing as of
immediately following entry into this Agreement and ending twelve (12) months following such termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive
agreement providing for a Competing Proposal (which Competing Proposal is subsequently consummated, whether during or following such 12-month period) or
consummates a transaction contemplated by such Competing Proposal; provided that for purposes of this Section 8.3(a)(iii), each reference to "15%" in the
definition of "Competing Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%".

        (b)   Payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made to the account or accounts designated by Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds (i) in
the case of Section 8.3(a)(i), within three (3) business days of the date of such termination, (ii) in the case of Section 8.3(a)(ii), on the date the Company enters into a
definitive agreement providing for such Superior Proposal, and (iii) in the case of Section 8.3(a)(iii), concurrently with the consummation of the transaction contemplated
by such Competing Proposal.

        (c)   Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements,
the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3 and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a final non-appealable judgment in its favor, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and Expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on the amount of
such payment from the date such payment was required to be made under this Section 8.3 until the actual date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime interest
rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such interest begins accruing.

        (d)   The parties further acknowledge and agree that the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent and

and Merger Sub while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, under circumstances where the Company
Termination Fee is due and payable, in no event shall Parent's right to receive monetary damages pursuant to this Section 8.3 be greater than the Company Termination
Fee (together with any amounts, if any, due under Section 8.3(c)). In the event Parent receives the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b), such payment
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its Subsidiaries, the Equity Investor, the Financing Sources or any other financing source of Parent, and any of their
respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, equityholders, controlling persons, general or limited partners, managers, members,
affiliates, agents or other Representatives (each, a "Parent Related Party") for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and under
circumstances where such Company Termination Fee is due, upon payment of such amount, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Company Related Parties
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

        (e)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by any Parent Related Party
for breaches under this Agreement, the Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount equal to $38,760,000 in the aggregate for all such breaches, plus
any amounts payable by Parent pursuant to the Company's rights to be indemnified or reimbursed by Parent in accordance with Section 6.14(c), Section 6.14(d) , and
Section 9.3 (collectively, the "Parent Liability Limitation"). In no event will any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates, agents or other Representatives (each, a "Company Related Party") seek or
obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against the Parent Related Parties
and in no event will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation
against the Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (including for any breach by Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions
under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Other than Guarantor's obligations under the Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter
and other than the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in no event will any Parent Related Party or any other Person
other than Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the Transactions.

        (f)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in Section 8.3(d) or Section 8.3(e) shall limit the right of a party to bring or maintain any Legal Proceeding (i) for
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to the extent provided in Section 9.13, unless and until this Agreement has been terminated and the Company
Termination Fee has been paid to Parent in accordance with Section 8.3(b) and (ii) against the other parties or their affiliates arising out of or in connection with a breach
of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that while the Company may pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to the extent
provided in Section 9.13 and monetary damages, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to pursuant to Section 9.13 and monetary damages.

or third party claim of any kind or description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source or other Person

the grant of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by any other parties to this Agreement (including any

compliance with Section 2.1(d) of the Merger Agreement), (B) changes the form of consideration payable in the Merger or any consideration otherwise payable
with respect to the shares of Common Stock or Company Options beneficially owned by Stockholder or (C) otherwise materially amends the Merger Agreement
in a manner adverse to the Stockholder relative to the other stockholders of the Company; or

        (iv)  the mutual written consent of Parent and Stockholder.

Person shall have any rights against such party), whether under contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to the subject matter hereof, provided, however, that the

        (e)    Governing Law, Jurisdiction.    This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any
conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state or jurisdiction. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if (and only if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior
Court of the State of Delaware or, to the extent they have subject matter jurisdiction, Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware, and
the respective appellate courts from the foregoing (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Delaware Courts"), in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or therewith or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in the applicable Delaware Court, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in the applicable Delaware Court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the applicable Delaware Court and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the applicable Delaware Court. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in accordance with Section 12(a) . Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

        (f)    Waiver of Jury Trial.    EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH
PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12(f).

        (g)    Assignment.    This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of each of the other parties hereto, and
any assignment without such consent shall be null and void; provided, however, that Parent and Merger Sub may assign, in their sole discretion and without the consent of
any other party hereto, any or all of their rights, interests and obligations hereunder to each other or to one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent
in connection with the assignment of the rights, interests and obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement to such direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiaries of Parent in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, and any such assignee may thereafter assign, in its sole discretion and without the
consent of any other

party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more additional direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent in connection with the
assignment of the rights, interests and obligations of such assignee under the Merger Agreement to such additional direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent
in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of their respective
obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

        (h)    Severability of Provisions.    If any term or other provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent
of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

        (i)    Specific Performance.    The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any party hereto failing to take such actions as are required of
it hereunder in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) the parties hereto will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof; and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Agreement and without that right, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement.
It is accordingly agreed that each party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity and any party hereto seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or other security.

        (j)    Amendment.    No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by each of the parties hereto, and no
waiver or consent hereunder shall be effective against any party unless it shall be in writing and signed by such party.

        (k)    Binding Nature.    This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

        (l)    No Recourse.    Parent and Merger Sub agree that Stockholder will not be liable for claims, losses, damages, expenses and other liabilities or obligations
resulting from or related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger (other than any liability for claims, losses, damages, expenses and other liabilities or obligations solely to
the extent arising under, and in accordance with the terms of, this Agreement), including the Company's breach of the Merger Agreement.

        (m)    No Presumption.    This Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

        (n)    No Agreement Until Executed.    This Agreement shall not be effective unless and until (i) the Merger Agreement is executed by all parties thereto and (ii) this
Agreement is executed by all parties hereto.

        (o)    No Ownership Interest.    Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent or Merger
Sub any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to the Stockholder Securities. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and
relating to the Stockholder Securities shall remain vested in and belong to Stockholder, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any authority to manage, direct,
restrict, regulate, govern, or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority to direct Stockholder in the voting of any of
the Stockholder Securities, except as otherwise specifically provided herein.

proper business as may come before the meeting. The date, time and place, if any, and/or the means of remote communication, of the annual meeting may be determined by

created directorships), and may be held at such time and place, within or outside of the State of Delaware, and/or by means of remote communication, as shall be stated in a

than 60 days before the date of the meeting. All such notices shall be delivered, either personally, by mail, or by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder
to whom the notice is given, by or at the direction of the board of directors, the president or the secretary, and if mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at his, her or its address as the same appears on the records of the Corporation. If given by
electronic transmission, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered (a) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to
receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (c) if by a posting on an electronic
network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (1) such posting, and (2) the giving of such separate notice, and (3) if by any
other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation. Any such
consent shall be deemed revoked if (1) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such
consent and (2) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

        Section 5.    Stockholders List.    The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall make, at least 10 days before every meeting of the stockholders, a
complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in
the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the
meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, and/or
(ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic
network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place,
then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the
meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

        Section 6.    Quorum.    Except as otherwise provided by applicable law or by the Corporation's certificate of incorporation, a majority of the outstanding shares of the
Corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. If less than a majority of the outstanding shares are
represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time in accordance with Section 7 of this Article II, until a quorum shall
be present or represented.

        Section 7.    Adjourned Meetings.    When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any,
thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting
are announced at the meeting, at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the
original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting
shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

        Section 8.    Vote Required.    When a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled
to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the question is one upon which by express provisions of an applicable law or of the Corporation's
certificate of incorporation a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. Where a separate vote by
class is required, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of such class present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class, unless the
question is one upon which by express provisions of an applicable law or of the Corporation's certificate of incorporation a different vote is required, in which case such express
provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.

        Section 9.    Voting Rights.    Except as otherwise provided by the DGCL or by the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or any amendments thereto, every
stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of common stock held by such stockholder.

        Section 10.    Proxies.    Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may
authorize another person(s) to act for him, her or it by proxy. Every proxy must be signed by the stockholder granting the proxy or by his, her or its attorney-in-fact. No proxy
shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is
irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the
interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally.

        Section 11.    Action by Written Consent.    Unless otherwise provided in the Corporation's certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or
special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent(s) in writing, setting forth the action so taken and bearing the dates of signature of the stockholders who signed the
consent(s), shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares of stock having not less than a majority of the shares entitled to vote, or, if greater, not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to
the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, or the Corporation's principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having
custody of the book(s) in which proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, provided, however, that no consent(s) delivered by certified or registered mail shall be deemed delivered until such consent(s) are
actually received at the registered office. All consents properly delivered in accordance with this Section 11 shall be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written
consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation as required by this
Section 11, written consents signed by the holders of a sufficient number of shares to take such corporate action are so recorded. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate
action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. Any action taken pursuant to such
written consent(s) of the stockholders shall have the same force and effect as if taken by the stockholders at a meeting thereof. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction
of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used; provided that such copy,
facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.

        Section 12.    Action by Electronic Transmission Consent.    An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder,
or by a person or persons

electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder or proxyholder and (B) the date on
which such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram, cablegram or other
electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered to the Corporation by
delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings
of meetings of stockholders are recorded if, to the extent and in the manner provided by resolution of the board of directors of the Corporation.

as may otherwise be provided by a resolution of the board of directors designating such committee. Unless otherwise provided in such a resolution, the presence of at least a
majority of the members of the committee shall be necessary to constitute a quorum. In the event that a member and that member's alternate, if alternates are designated by the
board of directors as provided in Section 8 of this Article III, of such committee is or are absent or disqualified, the member(s) thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified
from voting, whether or not such member(s) constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in place of any such
absent or disqualified member.

        Section 10.    Communications Equipment.    Members of the board of directors or any committee thereof may participate in and act at any meeting of such board or
committee through the use of a conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and
participation in the meeting pursuant to this Section 10 shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

        Section 11.    Waiver of Notice and Presumption of Assent.    Any member of the board of directors or any committee thereof who is present at a meeting shall be
conclusively presumed to have waived notice of such meeting except when such member attends for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Such member shall be conclusively presumed to have assented to any action taken unless his
or her dissent shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless his or her written dissent to such action shall be filed with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting
before the adjournment thereof or shall be forwarded by registered mail to the secretary of the Corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. Such right to
dissent shall not apply to any member who voted in favor of such action.

writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing(s) or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee. Such

to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. When
authorizing such issue of a new certificate(s), the board of directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen, or destroyed certificate(s), or his or her legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made
against the Corporation on account of the loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.

        Section 3.    Fixing a Record Date for Stockholder Meetings.     In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting

date is adopted by the board of directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by
the board of directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day immediately preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A
determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the
board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

        Section 4.    Fixing a Record Date for Action by Written Consent.     In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the board of directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. If no
record date has been fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no
prior action by the board of directors is required by statute, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of
the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail,

distribution or allotment or any rights of the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purposes of any
other lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and
which record date shall be not more than sixty days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at

record the transfer of such share(s), or in the case of uncertificated shares prior to receipt of a request to record the transfer of such share(s), the Corporation may treat the
registered owner as the person entitled to receive dividends, to vote, to receive notifications, and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of an owner. The Corporation
shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share(s) on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice
thereof.

        Section 7.    Subscriptions for Stock.     Unless otherwise provided for in the subscription agreement, subscriptions for shares shall be paid in full at such time, or in such

any officer or director of the Corporation, and may pay the expenses incurred by any employee or agent of the Corporation, in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition; provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon
receipt of an undertaking by the person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI
or otherwise.

        Section 4.    Determination; Claim.     If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such Proceeding) or advancement of expenses under this Article VI

successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any such action the Corporation shall

Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of the DGCL.

        Section 7.    Other Indemnification.     The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify or advance expenses to any person who was or is serving at its request as a

as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit enterprise.

        Section 8.    Continuation of Indemnification.     The rights to indemnification and to prepayment of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VI shall

legatees and distributees of such person.

individual who serves or has served as a director or officer of the Corporation (whether before or after the adoption of these by-laws), in consideration of such person's
performance of such services, and pursuant to this Article VI the Corporation intends to be legally bound to each such current or former director or officer of the Corporation.

vested, and shall be deemed to have vested fully, immediately upon adoption of these by-laws. With respect to any directors or officers of the Corporation who commence service

March 30, 2017
TRC Companies, Inc.
650 Suffolk Street
Wannalancit Mills
Lowell, MA 01854
Attn: Board of Directors
Dear Members of the Board of Directors:

        We understand that TRC Companies, Inc. (the "Company") intends to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") by and among Bolt Infrastructure
Parent, Inc. (the "Acquiror"), Bolt Infrastructure Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror ("Merger Sub"), and the Company pursuant to which, among other
things (i) Merger Sub will merge with the Company (the "Merger"), (ii) each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share ("Common Stock"), of the Company
will be converted into the right to receive $17.55 per share in cash (the "Consideration"), and (iii) the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror.

        The Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company has requested that Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. ("Houlihan Lokey") provide an opinion (the "Opinion") to the Board
as to whether, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock in the Merger pursuant to the Agreement is fair, from a financial point of
view, to such holders.

        In connection with this Opinion, we have made such reviews, analyses and inquiries as we have deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances. Among other
things, we have:

1. reviewed a draft, dated March 29, 2017, of the Agreement; 

2. reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we deemed to be relevant; 

3. reviewed certain information relating to the historical, current and future operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company made available to us by the
Company, including financial projections (and adjustments thereto) prepared by the management of the Company relating to the Company (the "Projections"); 

4. spoken with certain members of the management of the Company and certain of its representatives and advisors regarding the business, operations, financial
condition and prospects of the Company, the Merger and related matters; 

5. compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with that of other companies with publicly traded equity securities that we deemed to be
relevant; 

6. considered the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions that we deemed to be relevant; 

7. reviewed the current and historical market prices and trading volume for the Common Stock and the current and historical market prices and trading volume of the
publicly traded securities of certain other companies that we deemed to be relevant; and 

8. conducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other information and factors as we deemed appropriate.

        We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all data, material and other information furnished, or otherwise made
available, to us,

discussed with or reviewed by us, or publicly available, and do not assume any responsibility with respect to such data, material and other information. In addition, management
of the Company has advised us, and we have assumed, that the Projections have been reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of such management as to the future financial results and condition of the Company. At your direction, we have assumed that the Projections provide a reasonable
basis on which to evaluate the Company and the Merger and we have, at your direction, used and relied upon the Projections for purposes of our analyses and this Opinion. We
express no view or opinion with respect to the Projections or the assumptions on which they are based. We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that
there has been no change in the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of the Company since the respective dates of the
most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise, provided to us that would be material to our analyses or this Opinion, and that there is no
information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by us incomplete or misleading.

        We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (a) the representations and warranties of all parties to the Agreement and all other related
documents and instruments that are referred to therein are true and correct, (b) each party to the Agreement and such other related documents and instruments will fully and
timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by such party, (c) all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver
thereof, and (d) the Merger will be consummated in a timely manner in accordance with the terms described in the Agreement and such other related documents and instruments,
without any amendments or modifications thereto. We have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (i) the Merger will be consummated in a manner that
complies in all respects with all applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations, and (ii) all governmental, regulatory, and other consents and approvals necessary for
the consummation of the Merger will be obtained and that no delay, limitations, restrictions or conditions will be imposed or amendments, modifications or waivers made that
would have an effect on the Merger or the Company that would be material to our analyses or this Opinion. In addition, we have relied upon and assumed, without independent
verification, that the final form of the Agreement will not differ in any respect from the draft of the Agreement identified above.

        Furthermore, in connection with this Opinion, we have not been requested to make, and have not made, any physical inspection or independent appraisal or evaluation of
any of the assets, properties or liabilities (fixed, contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or otherwise) of the Company or any other party, nor were we provided with any such
appraisal or evaluation. We did not estimate, and express no opinion regarding, the liquidation value of any entity or business. We have undertaken no independent analysis of
any potential or actual litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to which the Company is or may be a party or is or may be subject,
or of any governmental investigation of any possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities to which the Company is or may be a party or is or may be subject.

        This Opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. We
have not undertaken, and are under no obligation, to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw this Opinion, or otherwise comment on or consider events occurring or coming to our
attention after the date hereof. We are not expressing any opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the Common Stock may be purchased or sold, or otherwise be
transferable, at any time.

        This Opinion is furnished for the use of the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and may not be used for any other purpose without
our prior written consent. This Opinion is not intended to be, and does not constitute, a recommendation to the Board, the

Company, any security holder or any other party as to how to act or vote with respect to any matter relating to the Merger or otherwise.

        In the ordinary course of business, certain of our employees and affiliates, as well as investment funds in which they may have financial interests or with which they may co-
invest, may acquire, hold or sell, long or short positions, or trade, in debt, equity, and other securities and financial instruments (including loans and other obligations) of, or
investments in, the Company, the Acquiror or any other party that may be involved in the Merger and their respective affiliates or any currency or commodity that may be
involved in the Merger.

        Houlihan Lokey and certain of its affiliates have in the past provided and are currently providing investment banking, financial advisory and other financial services to New
Mountain Capital, LLC ("NMC"), or one or more security holders, affiliates and/or portfolio companies of investment funds affiliated or associated with NMC (collectively, with
NMC, the "NMC Group"), for which Houlihan Lokey and its affiliates have received, and may receive, compensation. Houlihan Lokey and certain of its affiliates may provide
investment banking, financial advisory and other financial services to the Company, the Acquiror, members of the NMC Group, other participants in the Merger or certain of their
respective affiliates or security holders in the future, for which Houlihan Lokey and its affiliates may receive compensation. In addition, Houlihan Lokey and certain of its
affiliates and certain of our and their respective employees may have committed to invest in private equity or other investment funds managed or advised by NMC, other
participants in the Merger or certain of their respective affiliates or security holders, and in portfolio companies of such funds, and may have co-invested with members of the
NMC Group, other participants in the Merger or certain of their respective affiliates or security holders, and may do so in the future. Furthermore, in connection with
bankruptcies, restructurings, and similar matters, Houlihan Lokey and certain of its affiliates may have in the past acted, may currently be acting and may in the future act as
financial advisor to debtors, creditors, equity holders, trustees, agents and other interested parties (including, without limitation, formal and informal committees or groups of
creditors) that may have included or represented and may include or represent, directly or indirectly, or may be or have been adverse to, the Company, the Acquiror, members of
the NMC Group, other participants in the Merger or certain of their respective affiliates or security holders, for which advice and services Houlihan Lokey and its affiliates have
received and may receive compensation.

        Houlihan Lokey has also acted as financial advisor to the Board in connection with, and has participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Merger and will receive
a transaction fee for such services, which will be based on the value of the Merger. A portion of such fee became payable to us upon the rendering of this Opinion and a
substantial portion of such fee is contingent upon the successful completion of the Merger. The Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses and to indemnify us
and certain related parties for certain potential liabilities arising out of our engagement.

        This Opinion only addresses the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock of the Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger
pursuant to the Agreement and does not address any other aspect or implication of the Merger, any related transaction or any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered
into in connection therewith or otherwise. We have not been requested to opine as to, and this Opinion does not express an opinion as to or otherwise address, among other
things: (i) the underlying business decision of the Board, the Company, its security holders or any other party to proceed with or effect the Merger, (ii) the terms of any
arrangements, understandings, agreements or documents related to, or the form, structure or any other portion or aspect of, the Merger or otherwise (other than the Consideration
to the extent expressly specified herein), (iii) the fairness of any portion or aspect of the Merger to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the
Company, or to any other party, except if and only to the extent expressly set forth in the last sentence of this Opinion, (iv) the relative merits of the Merger

environmental, accounting, insurance, tax or other similar professional advice. It is assumed that such opinions, counsel or interpretations have been or will be obtained from the
appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, we have relied, with the consent of the Board, on the assessments by the Board, the Company and their respective advisors, as to
all legal, regulatory, environmental, accounting, insurance and tax matters with respect to the Company, the Merger or otherwise. The issuance of this Opinion was approved by a
committee authorized to approve opinions of this nature.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be received by the holders of Common
Stock in the Merger pursuant to the Agreement is fair to such holders from a financial point of view.

Very truly yours,

ANNEX C 

Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware 

        § 262. Appraisal rights

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with
respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of
this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an
appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As
used in this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant
by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions
thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant
to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256,
§ 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice
of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record
by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a
merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a
constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257,
258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect
thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record
by more than 2,000 holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by
the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as
contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as
practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent
corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its
stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such
meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to
subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a
copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal
of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder
intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has
not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the
effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or
series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are
available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to

appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later
of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving
or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date
of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation
notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date;
provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to
§ 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first
notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in
accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice
that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders
entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is
given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record
date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice
is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with
subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date
of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to
receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement
shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or
within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding
subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in
such person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within
20 days after such service file

in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded
payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall
give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders
shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of
general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal
rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates
of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the
Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent
corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares
who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible
for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was
approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of
Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of
any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined
to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded
quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective
date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by
the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the
appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting
corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders
entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented
by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of
Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of
a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section
shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable
to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed
within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such
stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as
provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon
the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the
merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
