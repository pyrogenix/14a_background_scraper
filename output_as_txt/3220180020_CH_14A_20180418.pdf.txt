April 18, 2018

Dear Stockholder:

         You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the stockholders of CommerceHub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (CommerceHub, we, us, our or the Company), which we will
hold at 12:00 p.m., local time, on May 18, 2018, at the offices of Baker Botts L.L.P., 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10112, telephone (212) 408-2500.

         At the special meeting, holders of our Series A common stock and Series B common stock (together, the voting stock) will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the
Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the merger agreement), dated as of March 5, 2018, by and among CommerceHub, Great Dane Parent, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (Parent), and Great Dane Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (Merger Sub), pursuant to which
Merger Sub will merge (the merger) with and into CommerceHub, with CommerceHub continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent and Merger
Sub were formed by affiliates of GTCR LLC (GTCR) and affiliates of Sycamore Partners Management, L.P. (Sycamore) to facilitate the participation of investment funds advised by GTCR
and Sycamore in the transaction. As a result of the merger, each share of Series A common stock, Series B common stock and Series C common stock (collectively, the common stock) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or CommerceHub, and any shares of common stock held by any
stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and who does
not fail to perfect or otherwise effectively withdraw their demand or otherwise lose the right to appraisal), will be converted into the right to receive $22.75 in cash, without interest and less
applicable withholding taxes. The per-share price of $22.75 represents a 24.5% premium to the Series A common stock closing price as of March 5, 2018, a 19.3% premium to the one-month
volume-weighted average Series A common stock closing price, a 30.2% premium to the Series C common stock closing price as of March 5, 2018, and a 27.1% premium to the one-month
volume-weighted average Series C common stock closing price. The Series B common stock, which is convertible on a one-for-one basis at the option of the holder into shares of Series A
common stock, is sparsely traded and does not have an active trading market or readily available price quotations.

         Our board of directors (our board) has unanimously approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, CommerceHub and its stockholders. Our board unanimously recommends
that stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and "FOR" the related proposals described in the enclosed proxy statement.

         The proxy statement describes the merger agreement, the merger and related agreements and provides specific information concerning the special meeting. In addition, you may obtain
information about CommerceHub from documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to read the entire proxy statement carefully, including the annexes, as it
sets forth the details of the merger agreement and other important information related to the merger.

        Your vote is very important.    The merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the shares of our voting stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m.
New York City time on April 16, 2018 and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. The other proposals described in the
proxy statement require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the shares of our voting stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled
to vote on such proposal at the special meeting, voting together as a single class. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, we ask you to submit a proxy to have your shares voted
in advance of the special meeting by using one of the methods described in the proxy statement. If you hold your shares in "street name," you should instruct your broker, bank, trust or other
nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee.

         If you have any questions or need assistance in voting your shares, please contact our proxy solicitor, D.F. King & Co., Inc., at:

         Thank you for your cooperation and continued support and interest in CommerceHub.

         Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved the merger, passed upon the merits or fairness of the
merger or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

         This proxy statement is dated April 18, 2018 and is first being mailed to stockholders on or about April 19, 2018.

 Very truly yours,
 

 

Francis Poore

meeting, if you hold shares of voting stock in your own name as the stockholder of record, please vote your shares by completing, signing, dating, and returning by mail the enclosed
proxy card or by using the telephone number printed on your proxy card or by using the Internet voting instructions printed on your proxy card.

        If you sign your proxy, but do not indicate how you wish to vote, your shares of voting stock will be voted "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, "FOR" the
advisory compensation proposal, and "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

        If your shares of voting stock are held in "street name," you should instruct your broker, bank, trust or other nominee on how to vote such shares of voting stock using the
instructions provided by your broker, bank, trust or other nominee. If you fail to provide your nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares of voting stock, your nominee will
not be able to vote such shares at the special meeting. If your shares of voting stock are held in "street name," you must obtain a legal proxy from such nominee in order to vote in person
at the special meeting.

Required Vote (Page 24) 

        For CommerceHub to complete the merger, stockholders holding a majority of the combined voting power of the shares of our voting stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the record date and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, must vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares
of voting stock, an abstention or broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        Approval of each of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of
the shares of our voting stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special meeting, voting together as a single class. Under our bylaws,
abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting
results for these proposals (assuming a quorum is present).

Voting by CommerceHub's Directors and Executive Officers (Page 24) 

        The directors of CommerceHub have informed CommerceHub that, as of the date of this proxy statement and to the extent they own shares of voting stock, they intend to vote in
favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, although none of them has an obligation to do so. In addition, the directors of CommerceHub have informed CommerceHub that, as
of the date of this proxy statement and to the extent they own shares of voting stock, they intend to vote in favor of the advisory compensation proposal, and in favor of the adjournment
proposal. As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date, our directors owned, in the aggregate, less than 1% of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding shares of voting
stock, and none of our executive officers owned any shares of voting stock.

Voting by Certain CommerceHub Stockholders (Page 24 and Annex D) 

        In connection with the merger agreement, Parent and CommerceHub entered into a voting agreement with a charitable trust affiliated with John C. Malone (the trust), with respect
to the shares of common stock held by the trust (the voting agreement). Pursuant to the voting agreement, the trust agreed, among other things and subject to certain conditions, to, at
any meeting of stockholders of CommerceHub called to vote upon the adoption of the merger agreement, vote all shares of voting stock beneficially owned by the trust in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement, and to vote against certain other matters that would reasonably be expected to prevent or interfere with the

        A stockholder of record of voting stock may revoke his or her proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting by:

• submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures described above, or by completing, signing, dating, and
returning a new proxy card by mail to CommerceHub; 

• attending the special meeting and voting in person; or 

• delivering to the Secretary of CommerceHub a written notice of revocation c/o CommerceHub, Inc., 201 Fuller Road, 6th Floor, Albany, New York 12203, Attn:
Secretary.

        Attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy.

        If you hold your shares of voting stock in "street name" through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to you by your broker,
bank, trust or other nominee in order to revoke your voting instructions or submit new voting instructions.

The Merger (Page 28) 

        The merger agreement provides that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in the merger agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into CommerceHub.
CommerceHub will be the surviving corporation (the Surviving Corporation) in the merger and will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

        If the merger is completed, at the effective time of the merger (the effective time), each outstanding share of common stock (other than shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or
CommerceHub, and any shares of common stock held by any stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL) and who does not fail to perfect or otherwise effectively withdraw their demand or otherwise lose the right to appraisal
(such shares, dissenting shares)) will be automatically converted into the right to receive $22.75 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. We refer to this
amount as the merger consideration.

        Upon completion of the merger, shares of common stock will no longer be listed on any stock exchange or quotation system. You will not own any shares of the Surviving
Corporation. The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. Please read it carefully.

Recommendation of Our Board and Reasons for the Merger (Page 28) 

        Our board of directors (our board) has unanimously approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby including, without limitation, the merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, CommerceHub and its stockholders. Our board unanimously recommends that
stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Our board further unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the advisory
compensation proposal, and "FOR" the adjournment proposal. For the factors considered by our board in reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the merger
agreement, see the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Reasons for the Merger".

Opinion of CommerceHub's Financial Advisor (Page 41 and Annex B) 

        At a meeting of the board held on March 5, 2018, Evercore Group L.L.C. (Evercore) rendered its oral opinion to the board, which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery
of a written opinion dated March 5, 2018, that, as of the date thereof, and based upon and subject to the factors, procedures, assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set
forth in its written opinion, the per-share merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of common stock (other than certain excluded
stockholders as described in the written opinion, which we refer to as the Excluded Stockholders) entitled to receive such per-share merger consideration.

        The full text of Evercore's written opinion, dated March 5, 2018, which sets forth, among other things, the factors considered, procedures followed, assumptions made
and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Evercore in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated
herein by reference in its entirety. Evercore's opinion was addressed to, and for the information and benefit of, the board in connection with its evaluation of the merger.
Evercore's opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to CommerceHub, nor did it
address the underlying business decision of CommerceHub to engage in the merger. Evercore's opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the board or to any other
persons in respect of the merger, including as to how any holder of shares of common stock should vote or act with respect to the merger.

prior to the closing date of the merger, if any, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and which authorize the release of all encumbrances securing such

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in the merger agreement as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the

Treatment of Company Equity Awards (Page 64) 

        CommerceHub Stock Options.    As of the effective time, each CommerceHub stock option, whether or not vested and exercisable, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the effective time will be automatically cancelled and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares
of common stock that were issuable upon exercise or settlement of such CommerceHub stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (2) the excess, if any, of $22.75 over the
per-share exercise price of such CommerceHub stock option, less applicable tax withholding.

        Restricted Stock.    As of the effective time, each outstanding share of CommerceHub restricted stock, whether or not vested, shall be cancelled and the holder shall instead be
entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to $22.75, less any applicable tax withholding.

        Restricted Stock Unit Awards.    As of the effective time, each outstanding CommerceHub restricted stock unit award other than the 2018 employee RSU awards (as defined below)
(each, an accelerated RSU award), whether or not vested, will be automatically cancelled and the holder shall instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (1) $22.75
multiplied by (2) the number of shares of common stock subject to such accelerated RSU award, less any applicable tax withholding. As of the effective time, each outstanding
CommerceHub restricted stock unit award granted in 2018 to an employee (but not to a director) (each, a 2018 employee RSU award) will vest with respect to 25% of the restricted
stock units subject to such 2018 employee RSU award, with such vested restricted stock units will be treated in the same manner as the accelerated RSU awards. Each restricted stock
unit granted pursuant to a 2018 employee RSU award that does not vest as of the effective time shall be cancelled and converted into a right to receive $22.75 in cash (such rights a cash
award). The cash award will vest in 25% installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date of the applicable 2018 employee RSU award, subject to the holder's
continued employment with CommerceHub through each vesting date.

Treatment of CommerceHub's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Page 64) 

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, the current offering period under CommerceHub's Amended and Restated 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) ended on March 26,

Interests of CommerceHub's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (Page 54) 

        In considering the recommendation of our board with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that some of CommerceHub's directors and executive officers have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of CommerceHub stockholders generally. Interests of our directors and executive officers that may be
different from or in addition to the interests of CommerceHub stockholders include:

• The merger agreement provides for the accelerated vesting and cash-out of all CommerceHub equity awards (other than the 2018 employee RSU awards) and partial
accelerated vesting and cash-out of the 2018 employee RSU awards. 

• CommerceHub's executive officers are parties to employment agreements and other arrangements with CommerceHub that provide for severance benefits in the event of
certain qualifying terminations of employment. 

• Amounts deferred by directors under the Company's Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan will be accelerated and paid in connection with the merger. 

• Pursuant to the co-investor agreement (as defined herein) and other agreements contemplated thereby, Francis Poore, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has
agreed to purchase $6 million of preferred and common equity of Great Dane Holding, LLC, an affiliate of Parent (Great Dane Holding). Mr. Poore and Great Dane
Holding have agreed that Mr. Poore will serve as the Chief Executive Officer of Great Dane Holding and participate in a management incentive program featuring both
time-based and performance-based awards. 

• Following the merger, CommerceHub's other executive officers are expected to retain their positions with the Surviving Corporation, and, in connection with such
employment, such officers may be granted the right to purchase or participate in the equity of the Surviving Corporation. 

• CommerceHub's directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under indemnification agreements, the merger
agreement and applicable insurance coverage obtained by CommerceHub.

        These interests are discussed in more detail in the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger." Our board was aware of the different or
additional interests set forth in this proxy statement and considered such interests along with other matters in approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including, without limitation, the merger.

Financing (Page 52) 

        CommerceHub and Parent estimate that the total amount of funds required to complete the merger and related transactions and pay related fees and expenses will be approximately
$1.1 billion. Parent expects this amount to be funded through a combination of the following:

• Certain investment funds associated with GTCR and Sycamore (together, the Investors/Guarantors) have committed, pursuant to equity commitment letters dated as of
March 5, 2018, to capitalize Parent, at or prior to the effective time, with an aggregate equity contribution up to $642 million, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the equity commitment letters. 

• Jefferies Finance LLC, Golub Capital Markets LLC, KKR Corporate Lending LLC and HPS Investment Partners, LLC have committed to provide an aggregate principal
amount of $465 million in debt financing, consisting of $320 million in senior secured first-lien loan facilities (consisting of a $30 million revolving credit facility and a
$290 million term loan

facility) and a $145 million senior secured second-lien loan facility, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a debt commitment letter, dated as of March 5,
2018.

        The completion of the merger is not subject to any financing condition, although funding of the debt and equity financing is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
the commitment letters under which the financing will be provided.

Limited Guarantees (Page 54) 

        The Investors/Guarantors have executed and delivered limited guarantees in favor of CommerceHub to guarantee, on a several basis, Parent's obligations to pay any termination fee
payable to CommerceHub under the merger agreement, certain reimbursement and indemnification obligations in connection with the debt financing and certain other collection and
interest payment obligations under the merger agreement.

Alternative Transaction Proposal; Unsolicited Proposals (Page 70) 

        From the date of the merger agreement until the effective time or the termination of the merger agreement, CommerceHub and its subsidiaries have agreed to not:

• solicit or initiate, or knowingly facilitate or encourage, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an
alternative transaction proposal; 

• enter into, engage, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an alternative transaction proposal or grant access to or furnish to any
person any non-public information or data with respect to, or to knowingly cooperate in any way that would otherwise reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative
transaction proposal; 

• approve, endorse, recommend, execute or enter into any agreement, arrangement, understanding, contract, commitment or agreement in principle with respect to an
alternative transaction proposal or enter into any agreement, contract or commitment that requires CommerceHub to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; or 

• resolve, propose, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

        Following the date of the merger agreement until the date the stockholders approve the adoption of the merger agreement, if CommerceHub receives an unsolicited bona fide
written alternative transaction proposal (x) that our board determines in good faith to be, or to be reasonably likely to lead to, a superior proposal (as defined herein), and (y) in respect of
which our board determines in good faith that failure to take action would be reasonably likely to violate the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law, then CommerceHub may
take the following actions:

• furnish any nonpublic information to the person or group making such alternative transaction proposal and afford access to the business, properties, assets, books and
records of CommerceHub and its subsidiaries, provided that (i) prior to furnishing any such information, CommerceHub receives from such person or group an executed
confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality terms at least as restrictive and at least as favorable to CommerceHub as the terms contained in the confidentiality
agreement with Parent and Merger Sub (other than de minimis differences) and that does not prohibit or conflict with any obligation in the merger agreement, and
(ii) CommerceHub (A) will not, and will not permit its subsidiaries to, furnish any nonpublic information to any person or group who has made, or which would
reasonably be expected to make, an alternative transaction proposal except pursuant to such confidentiality agreement, and (B) shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries
to not, provide any commercially

sensitive nonpublic information to any competitor except in a manner consistent with CommerceHub's past practices in dealing with the disclosure of such information in
the context of considering alternative transaction proposals prior to the date of the merger agreement; and

• engage in discussions or negotiations with such person or group with respect to such alternative transaction proposal.

        Following the date of the merger agreement, CommerceHub shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) following CommerceHub's receipt of any
alternative transaction proposal or any proposal, offer or credible inquiry with respect to, or which could reasonably likely lead to, any alternative transaction proposal or any requests
for non-public information from, or any discussions or negotiations being sought to be initiated or continued with, CommerceHub, any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or representatives (any of the foregoing, an inquiry), provide Parent with written notice of such alternative transaction proposal or inquiry,
which notice shall include a written summary of the material terms and conditions thereof and copies of any proposed material written agreements or material correspondence
exchanged. In addition, CommerceHub shall provide Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) with (A) all information, material developments, discussions
or negotiations, in each case, as reasonably necessary to keep Parent reasonably currently informed of all written or material oral communications regarding, and the status of, and any
material developments regarding, any such alternative transaction proposal or inquiry and (B) all material nonpublic information concerning CommerceHub or its subsidiaries provided
to the person making such alternative transaction proposal or inquiry which was not previously provided to Parent.

Company Adverse Recommendation Change (Page 72) 

        Until the date the stockholders approve the adoption of the merger agreement, (A) solely in response to (x) an intervening event (as defined herein) or (y) a superior proposal, our
board may make a Company adverse recommendation change (as defined herein) if it determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law and (B) solely in the case of a superior proposal, our board may terminate
the merger agreement and enter into a superior proposal if, for either clause (A) or (B):

• in the case of a superior proposal, such superior proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a superior proposal, and did not, directly or
indirectly, result from or arise out of a breach of CommerceHub's non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement; 

• the CommerceHub stockholder approval has not been obtained; 

• our board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such intervening event or superior proposal,
as applicable, the failure to make a Company adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement and enter into a superior proposal, would reasonably be
likely to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law; 

• CommerceHub has: 

• provided Parent four business days' prior written notice (the notice period) which states (x) that CommerceHub has received a superior proposal or there has been
an intervening event, (y) the material terms of the superior proposal and a copy of all relevant transaction documents with respect thereto or the facts underlying
the determination by our board that an intervening event has occurred, and (z) that CommerceHub intends to make a Company

adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement and enter a superior proposal, as applicable;

• to the extent requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend the merger agreement to enable our board to maintain the Company
recommendation and not make a Company adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement during the notice period; 

• considered in good faith any bona fide offer made by Parent to CommerceHub during the notice period; and 

• following the expiration of the notice period and any negotiations with or consideration of any bona fide offers by Parent during the notice period, our board once
again determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such intervening event or superior proposal,
as applicable, the failure to make a Company adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement and enter into a superior proposal, would
reasonably be likely to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        None of CommerceHub, our board or any committee thereof shall enter into any agreement with any person to limit or not to give prior notice to Parent of its intention to effect a
Company adverse recommendation change or to terminate the merger agreement in light of a superior proposal.

Termination (Page 77) 

        CommerceHub, Parent and Merger Sub may terminate the merger agreement by mutual written consent at any time before the effective time. In addition, either CommerceHub or
Parent may terminate the merger agreement if:

• the merger has not been consummated on or before September 5, 2018 (the outside date), provided that either party may extend the outside date for a period of 75 days
upon written notice to the other party if all of the conditions to the closing of the merger have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied other than certain conditions
relating to the receipt of stockholder or HSR Act approvals; 

• any court or governmental authority has issued an order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger and such order
or other action is, or has become, final and non-appealable; 

• if CommerceHub stockholders fail to approve the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof; or 

• the other party breaches any representation, warranty or covenant that would result in the failure of a closing condition to be satisfied, subject to a cure period in certain
circumstances.

        CommerceHub may also terminate the merger agreement:

• at any time prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by CommerceHub stockholders, in order for CommerceHub to enter substantially concurrently into a definitive
written agreement with respect to an unsolicited superior proposal, subject to CommerceHub having first complied with certain notifications, match rights and other
obligations; or 

• if Parent fails to consummate the merger within three business days of CommerceHub providing notice that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the merger and at
such time as all other conditions to closing are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the closing of the
merger).

Table of Contents

        Parent may also terminate the merger agreement if, prior to approval of the merger by CommerceHub's stockholders:

• our board changes or adversely modifies its recommendation that CommerceHub stockholders vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement; or 

• CommerceHub willfully and materially breaches its non-solicitation obligations with respect to alternative transaction proposals.

Termination Fees (Page 78) 

        CommerceHub will be required to pay a termination fee to Parent in an amount in cash equal to $31.5 million if the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances.

        Parent will be required to pay to CommerceHub a reverse termination fee of $63 million in the event that the merger agreement is terminated under different specified
circumstances.

        These fees are discussed in more detail in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees".

Reimbursement of Expenses (Page 79) 

        Each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        If the merger agreement is terminated due to our board or a committee thereof having effected a Company adverse recommendation change (or such change otherwise occurs),
whether or not permitted in the merger agreement, following the special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, in either case, at which a final vote with respect to the
adoption of the merger agreement was taken, then CommerceHub shall, following receipt of an invoice therefor, no later than three business days after the date of such termination, pay,
or cause to be paid, at the direction of Parent, up to $5 million of Parent's reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and
disbursements) incurred by Parent and its affiliates on or prior to the termination of the merger agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        If a party fails promptly to pay to the other party any amounts due and, in order to obtain such payment, such other party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
failing party the non-prevailing party shall pay to the prevailing party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together
with interest.

Regulatory Approvals (Page 62) 

        Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until notifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice (the antitrust division) and the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) and all statutory waiting period requirements have been
satisfied. On April 6, 2018, the FTC granted early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the merger.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 59) 

        If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined below in "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger"), the receipt of cash in exchange for
shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder of common stock who receives cash in the merger
generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received and (2) such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of
common stock exchanged therefor. Such gain or loss

Table of Contents

generally will constitute capital gain or loss and will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period for the common stock exchanged is more than one year
as of the closing date of the merger.

        You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the exchange of shares of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger in light of
your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws).

Appraisal Rights (Page 88 and Annex C) 

        The holders of Series A common stock, Series B common stock and Series C common stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL. Under Delaware law, holders of our common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who properly demand appraisal of their
shares of common stock and who otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to seek appraisal for, and obtain payment in cash for the judicially
determined fair value of, their shares of common stock in lieu of receiving the merger consideration if the merger is completed, but only if they comply with all applicable requirements
of the DGCL. This value could be more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration. Any holder of shares of common stock intending to exercise appraisal rights must
deliver a written demand for appraisal to us prior to the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement (in the case
of holders of voting stock), continue to hold the shares of record through the effective date of the merger, and otherwise strictly comply with all of the procedures required by Delaware
law. The relevant provisions of the DGCL are included as Annex C to this proxy statement. Please read these provisions carefully. Failure to strictly comply with these provisions will
result in loss of the right of appraisal.

Completion of the Merger (Page 63) 

        We currently anticipate completing the merger in the second quarter of 2018, but we cannot predict the exact timing of the completion of the merger or whether the merger will be
completed. In order to complete the merger, CommerceHub stockholders must approve the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting and the other closing conditions
under the merger agreement, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, must be satisfied or, to the extent legally permitted, waived. Approval of the advisory compensation
proposal and the adjournment proposal are not conditions to the completion of the merger.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER 

        The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the special meeting, the merger agreement and the merger. These questions and answers may
not address all questions that may be important to you as a CommerceHub stockholder. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes
to this proxy statement, and the documents referred to in this proxy statement.

Q:    Why am I receiving this proxy statement?

A: On March 5, 2018, CommerceHub entered into the merger agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub, a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, with and into
CommerceHub, with CommerceHub surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with our board's solicitation of
proxies from holders of voting stock in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and in favor of the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting or any adjournment
or postponement of the special meeting.

Q:    What is the proposed transaction?

A: The proposed transaction is the merger of Merger Sub with and into CommerceHub pursuant to the merger agreement. Following the effective time, CommerceHub would be privately
held as a subsidiary of Parent.

Q:    What will I receive in the merger?

A: If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $22.75 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of our common stock that you own.
For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock, you will be entitled to receive $2,275 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock, without interest and less any
applicable withholding taxes. You will not be entitled to receive shares in the Surviving Corporation or any equity interests in Parent.

Q:    How does the per-share merger consideration compare to the unaffected market price of the common stock?

A: The $22.75 per-share merger consideration represented a 24.5% premium to the Series A common stock closing price as of March 5, 2018, a 19.3% premium to the one-month volume-
weighted average Series A common stock closing price, a 30.2% premium to the Series C common stock closing price as of March 5, 2018, and a 27.1% premium to the one-month
volume-weighted average Series C common stock closing price. The Series B common stock, which is convertible on a one-for-one basis at the option of the holder into shares of
Series A common stock, is sparsely traded and does not have an active trading market or readily available price quotations.

Q:    Where and when is the special meeting?

        

A: The special meeting will take place at 12:00 p.m., local time, on May 18, 2018, at the offices of Baker Botts, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10112, telephone (212) 408-
2500.

Q:    What matters will be voted on at the special meeting?

A: You will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals: 

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement; 

• a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, specified compensation that may become payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and

Table of Contents

• a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Q:    What is a quorum?

A: A quorum will be present if holders of a majority in total voting power of our shares of voting stock outstanding on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting are present
in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a
quorum is obtained.

If you submit a proxy but abstain or fail to provide voting instructions on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your shares of voting stock will be counted for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.

If your shares of voting stock are held in "street name" by your broker, bank, trust or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares of voting stock, these
shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the special meeting.

Q:    What vote of our stockholders is required to adopt the merger agreement?

A: Stockholders holding a majority of the combined voting power of the shares of our voting stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date and entitled to vote
thereon, voting together as a single class, must vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. In addition, under the merger agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a
condition to the completion of the merger. A failure to vote your shares of voting stock, an abstention, or broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal
to adopt the merger agreement.

Q:    What vote of our stockholders is required to approve other matters to be considered at the special meeting?

A: Approval of each of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the
shares of voting stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special meeting, voting together as a single class. Under our bylaws,
abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" these proposals. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting results for these proposals (assuming a quorum is
present). Because all proposals for the special meeting are non-routine and non-discretionary, there will not be any broker non-votes for such proposals.

Q:    How will our directors and executive officers vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement?

A: The directors of CommerceHub have informed CommerceHub that as of the date of this proxy statement and to the extent they own shares of voting stock, they intend to vote in favor
of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. In addition, the directors of CommerceHub have informed CommerceHub that, as of the date of this proxy statement and to the extent
they own shares of voting stock, they intend to vote in favor of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. As of 5:00 p.m., New York City local time, on the
record date, our directors owned, in the aggregate, less than 1% of the aggregate voting power of the shares of voting stock outstanding, and none of our executive officers owned any
shares of voting stock.

Table of Contents

Q:    Have any CommerceHub stockholders agreed to vote their shares in favor of any of the CommerceHub proposals?

        

A: Yes. In connection with the merger agreement, on March 5, 2018, Parent and CommerceHub entered into the voting agreement with the trust, with respect to the shares of common
stock held by the trust. As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date, the trust beneficially owned 101,164 shares of Series A common stock and 659,081 shares of Series B
common stock, collectively representing, in the aggregate, approximately 32.3% of the aggregate voting power represented by the voting stock. As of the record date, the trust also
beneficially owned 1,274,657 shares of Series C common stock.

Pursuant to the voting agreement, the trust agreed, among other things and subject to certain conditions, to, at any meeting of stockholders of CommerceHub called to vote upon the
adoption of the merger agreement, vote all shares of voting stock beneficially owned by the trust in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and to vote against certain other
matters that would reasonably be expected to prevent or interfere with the consummation of the merger, so long as such obligations have not terminated in accordance with the terms set
forth in the voting agreement. Based on these arrangements, as of the record date, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least an additional 17.8% of the aggregate voting power of the
shares of voting stock outstanding (exclusive of those held by the trust), voting together as a single class, is required in order to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

For a discussion of the voting agreement, see the section entitled "The Special Meeting—Voting by Certain CommerceHub Stockholders." A copy of the voting agreement is attached as
Annex D to this proxy statement.

Q:    What voting power do I have?

A: At the special meeting, holders of Series A common stock will have one vote per share and holders of Series B common stock will have ten votes per share, in each case, that our
records show are owned as of the record date. Holders of Series A common stock and Series B common stock will vote together as a single class. The holders of record of our Series C
common stock as of the record date are entitled to notice of the special meeting, but are not entitled to vote, except as required by Delaware law, and may not vote on the proposals to
be presented at the special meeting.

Q:    How does our board recommend that I vote?

A: Our board unanimously recommends that CommerceHub stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Our board further unanimously recommends that
stockholders vote "FOR" the advisory compensation proposal, and "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

Q:    When do you expect the merger to be completed?

        

A: We currently anticipate completing the merger in the second quarter of 2018, but we cannot predict the exact timing of the completion of the merger or whether the merger will be
completed. In order to complete the merger, CommerceHub stockholders must approve the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting and the other closing conditions
under the merger agreement, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, must be satisfied or, to the extent legally permitted, waived.

Table of Contents

Q:    What effects will the merger have on CommerceHub?

A: Our Series A common stock and Series C common stock are currently registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and are listed on the
Nasdaq Global Market (the Nasdaq) under the symbols "CHUBA" and "CHUBK," respectively. Our Series B common stock is not currently registered under the Exchange Act or
listed on the Nasdaq but is quoted in the OTC Markets under the symbol "CHUBB." As a result of the merger, CommerceHub will cease to be a publicly traded company and will
become a privately held subsidiary of Parent. Following the merger, the registration of our Series A common stock and Series C common stock and our reporting obligations under the
Exchange Act will be terminated and our common stock will no longer be listed or quoted on any stock exchange or quotation system, including the Nasdaq and the OTC Markets.

Q:    What happens if the merger is not completed?

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by CommerceHub stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, CommerceHub stockholders will not receive any
payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, we will remain a public company and shares of our common stock will continue to be listed or quoted
on the Nasdaq or OTC Markets, as applicable. In addition, under specified circumstances, CommerceHub may be required to pay Parent a termination fee. See "The Merger Agreement
—Termination Fees."

Q:    What will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory proposal on specified compensation payable to CommerceHub's named executive officers in connection with the
merger?

A: The approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on CommerceHub or Parent.
Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Therefore, regardless of whether CommerceHub
stockholders approve this proposal, if the merger is completed, the specified compensation will still be paid to CommerceHub's named executive officers to the extent payable in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and applicable compensation and severance arrangements.

Q:    What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of voting stock?

A: We urge you to read this proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents referred to in this proxy statement. Your vote is important. If you are a stockholder of
record of voting stock, you can ensure that your shares of voting stock are voted at the special meeting by submitting your proxy by: 

• mail, using the enclosed postage-paid envelope; 

• telephone, using the toll-free number listed on each proxy card; or 

• the Internet, at the address provided on each proxy card.

If you hold your shares of voting stock in "street name" through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you should follow the directions provided by your broker, bank, trust or other
nominee regarding how to instruct your nominee to vote your shares. Without those instructions, your shares of voting stock will not be voted, which will have the same effect as voting
"AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Q:    Can I revoke my proxy?

A: Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record of voting stock, you may revoke your proxy by notifying
CommerceHub's Secretary in writing at c/o CommerceHub, Inc., 201 Fuller Road, 6th Floor, Albany, NY 12203, Attn: Secretary, or by submitting a new proxy by telephone, the
Internet or mail, in each case, dated after the date of the proxy being revoked. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by attending the special meeting and voting in person (simply
attending the special meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked). Please note that if you hold your shares of voting stock in "street name" and you have instructed a broker, bank,
trust or other nominee to vote your shares of voting stock, the above-described options for revoking your voting instructions do not apply, and instead you must follow the instructions
received from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee to revoke your voting instructions or submit new voting instructions.

Q:    Will my shares of voting stock held in "street name" or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record?

A: No. Because any shares you may hold in "street name" will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares you hold of record, any shares so held will not be combined
for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a
minor, you will receive, and will need to separately submit a proxy card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or
business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account.

Q:    What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the merger?

A: If you transfer your shares of common stock (whether or not such shares are entitled to vote), you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger and
lost your right to appraisal of your shares under Delaware law. In order to receive the merger consideration (or, if you properly demand appraisal, to remain entitled to appraisal rights
with respect to your shares), you must hold your shares of common stock through completion of the merger.

The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the special meeting date and the closing of the merger. If you transfer your shares of voting stock
after the record date but before the special meeting, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger but, unless special arrangements are made,
retained the right to vote at the special meeting.

Q:    Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal from the exchange agent for the merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of
common stock for the merger consideration. If your shares of common stock are held in "street name" by your broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you may receive instructions from
your broker, bank, trust or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your "street name" shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Please
do not send in your stock certificates now.

Table of Contents

Q:    I do not know where my stock certificate is—how will I get the merger consideration for my shares?

A: If the merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the merger will include the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock
certificate. These procedures will include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificate. Parent may also require that you provide indemnity to the
Surviving Corporation in order to cover any potential loss from the missing stock certificate.

Q:    Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the merger consideration for my shares of common stock?

A: The holders of Series A common stock, Series B common stock, and Series C common stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL. Stockholders who do not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the
DGCL are entitled to statutory appraisal rights under Delaware law if the merger is completed. This means that if you comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, you
are entitled to have the "fair value" of your shares of common stock determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment based on that valuation instead of receiving
the merger consideration. The ultimate amount you would receive in an appraisal proceeding may be more than, the same as or less than the amount you would have received under the
merger agreement. To exercise your appraisal rights, you must strictly comply with the requirements of the DGCL. See "Appraisal Rights" and the text of the Delaware appraisal rights
statute, Section 262 of the DGCL, which is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement. Please read it carefully.

Q:    Do any of CommerceHub's directors or executive officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of CommerceHub stockholders generally?

A: Yes. In considering the recommendation of our board with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may
have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally. These interests include Mr. Poore's co-investor agreement to re-invest
$6 million of merger consideration in Great Dane Holding, an affiliate of Parent, and participate in a management incentive program featuring both time-based and performance-based
awards. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, (ii) approving the merger agreement and the merger, and (iii) recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by
stockholders, our board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger."

Q:    Will I have to pay taxes on the merger consideration I receive?

A: If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined below in "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger"), the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of
common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder of common stock who receives cash in the merger generally
will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received and (2) such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of common
stock exchanged therefor. Such gain or loss generally will constitute capital gain or loss and will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period for the
common stock exchanged is more than one year as of the closing date of the merger. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the
exchange of shares of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger

in light of your particular circumstances (including the application and effect of any federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws).

Q:    What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?

A: If your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the
proxy cards or voting instruction cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the Internet, if available to you) to ensure that all of your shares are voted.

Q:    Who is paying for this proxy solicitation?

A: Our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies on our behalf in person, by telephone, email or facsimile. These persons will not be paid additional remuneration for their
efforts. CommerceHub has also engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies and provide related advice and informational support, for a services fee of $7,500,
plus customary disbursements. CommerceHub will pay all expenses of filing, printing and mailing this proxy statement, including solicitation expenses.

Q:    What is householding and how does it affect me?

A: The Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless
contrary instructions have been received, but only if the applicable company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In cases where contrary instructions have been
received, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of
common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding our common stock, you may have already received a householding notification from your
broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this
proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.

Q:    Who can help answer my other questions?

A: If you have additional questions about the merger, or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed
proxy card, please contact our proxy solicitor, D.F. King & Co., Inc. at:

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

        This proxy statement, and the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement, include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, statements about the expected timetable for completing the transaction; beliefs and expectations of CommerceHub, GTCR and Sycamore
about the proposed acquisition of CommerceHub and their respective long-term vision for CommerceHub; expectations regarding the management, corporate structure, projected results, and
strategy of CommerceHub following the closing of the transaction; the expected impact of this transaction on CommerceHub's employees, customers, financial and operating results and
business; and the anticipated funding for the transaction. The words "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "may," "plans," "predicts," "will," "potential," "goal" and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. CommerceHub's actual results may differ materially from such
forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, some of which CommerceHub may not be able to predict and may not be within CommerceHub's control. Factors that could cause
such differences include, but are not limited to, (i) the risk that the proposed merger may not be completed in a timely manner, or at all, which may result in the payment of a termination fee by
CommerceHub and may adversely affect CommerceHub's business and the price of its common stock, (ii) the failure to satisfy all of the closing conditions of the proposed merger, including
the adoption of the merger agreement by CommerceHub's stockholders and the receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals, (iii) the occurrence of any event, change or other
circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement, (iv) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed merger on CommerceHub's business, operating
results and relationships with customers, suppliers, competitors and others, (v) risks that the proposed merger may divert management's attention and otherwise disrupt CommerceHub's current
plans and business operations, (vi) potential difficulties in hiring or retaining employees as a result of the proposed merger and (vii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted
against CommerceHub related to the merger agreement or the proposed merger. In addition, CommerceHub's actual performance and results may differ materially from those currently
anticipated due to a number of other risks, including, without limitation, market acceptance and performance of our products and services, competitive issues, general market conditions,
regulatory matters and changes in law affecting our business, and the "Risk Factors" described in CommerceHub's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 as filed
with the SEC on March 1, 2018 (the 2017 Annual Report), subsequent Quarterly Reports filed with the SEC and CommerceHub's other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements set forth
herein speak only as of the date of this proxy statement, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise to any such statement contained herein to reflect any
change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we
express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the
expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. There can be no assurance that any expectation or belief expressed in a forward-looking statement will occur, and you should
not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.

THE COMPANIES 

CommerceHub, Inc. 

        CommerceHub is a Delaware corporation that is a leading provider of cloud-based ecommerce fulfillment and marketing solutions for large retailers, marketplaces, consumer brands and
their suppliers. Our solutions help our customers implement strategies to increase their ecommerce revenues and create meaningful operational efficiencies within their supply chains. Our
customers use our cloud-based software and service capabilities, which are tailored for specific customer business rules and processes, to more effectively fulfill consumer orders, generate
consumer demand for their products and deliver those products to consumers.

        Since the beginning of ecommerce, retailers and brands have faced significant financial and operational difficulties transitioning their businesses to digital environments. For example,
retailers have been challenged by the task of providing their customers with the large selection of products that they expect and increasingly demand. Buying larger assortments of products
from suppliers and storing them in inventory requires significant capital investment for retailers. Similarly, operating warehouses equipped with the capabilities needed to receive and prepare
orders for shipment is complex and expensive. CommerceHub helps to solve these problems by helping retailers leverage the "virtual inventory" of thousands of suppliers. Through
CommerceHub's platform, retailers and suppliers can share product information and inventory data, and process customer orders that are drop-shipped with the retailer's branding and delivery
speed promises. In addition, by connecting with our large network of retailers and other demand channels, brands and suppliers are able to proactively unlock new sources of demand for their
products. For example, rather than relying exclusively on their legacy wholesale relationships and the consumer demand generated by their own websites, brands are able to extend their reach
by selling through additional retailers and online marketplaces, such as Amazon and eBay.

        Founded in 1997, CommerceHub has been operating as a stand-alone publicly traded company since our spin-off from Liberty Interactive Corporation on July 22, 2016 (the Spin-Off). A
detailed description of CommerceHub's business is contained in the 2017 Annual Report. See "Item 1—Business."

        Our principal executive offices are located at 201 Fuller Road, 6th Floor, Albany, New York 12203, and our telephone number at that address is (518) 810-0700. Our website address is
www.commercehub.com. The information contained in, or that may be accessed through, our website is not intended to be incorporated into this proxy statement.

Great Dane Parent, LLC and Great Dane Merger Sub, Inc. 

        Parent is a Delaware limited liability company and Merger Sub is a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Both Parent and Merger Sub were formed

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

Date, Time, and Place of the Special Meeting 

        This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by our board for use at the special meeting to be held at 12:00 p.m., local time, on May 18,
2018 at the offices of Baker Botts, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10112, telephone (212) 408-2500 or at any adjournment or postponement of such meeting. This proxy statement
is first being mailed to our stockholders on or about April 19, 2018.

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        The purpose of the special meeting is for the holders of our voting stock to consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 5, 2018 (as
may be amended from time to time), by and among CommerceHub, Parent and Merger Sub (the merger agreement). Holders of our voting stock must approve the adoption of the merger
agreement for the merger to be completed. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and the material provisions of the merger agreement are described
under "The Merger Agreement." Holders of our voting stock are also being asked to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement (the adjournment proposal).

        In addition, in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing holders of our voting stock with the opportunity to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote on specified
compensation that may be payable to CommerceHub's named executive officers in connection with the merger, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of the proxy statement
entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" (the advisory compensation proposal). The vote on the advisory compensation proposal is separate and apart
from the vote to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, a holder of our voting stock may vote to approve the adoption of the merger agreement and vote not to approve the advisory
compensation proposal and vice versa. Approval of this advisory compensation proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger. Because the advisory compensation proposal vote is
advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either CommerceHub or Parent. Accordingly, because CommerceHub is contractually obligated to pay the specified compensation, such
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable to such payment, if the merger is completed and regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

Record Date and Quorum 

        The holders of record of our voting stock as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 16, 2018 (the record date), are entitled to vote at the special meeting. All holders of our voting
stock will vote together as a single class on each proposal. On the record date, there were 13,614,132 shares of Series A common stock and 707,567 shares of Series B common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. The holders of record of our Series C common stock as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date are entitled to notice of the
special meeting but are not entitled to vote, except as required by Delaware law, and may not vote on the proposals to be presented at the special meeting.

        The presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority in total voting power of the shares of our voting stock outstanding on the record date and entitled to
vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum, permitting CommerceHub to conduct its business at the special meeting. Treasury shares, which are shares owned by CommerceHub itself,
are not voted and do not count for this purpose. Proxies received but not marked or marked as abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at
the special meeting. Because all proposals for the special meeting are non-routine and non-discretionary, there will not be any broker

non-votes for such proposals. See "—Voting; Proxies; Revocation—Submitting a Proxy or Providing Voting Instructions—Shares Held in "Street Name"" below.

Required Vote 

        For CommerceHub to complete the merger, under Delaware law, stockholders holding a majority of the combined voting power of the shares of our voting stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the record date and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, must vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your
shares of common stock, an abstention or broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        Approval of each of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the
shares of our voting stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special meeting, voting together as a single class. Under our bylaws,
abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting results for
these proposals (assuming a quorum is present).

Votes You Have 

        At the special meeting, holders of shares of Series A common stock will have one vote per share and holders of shares of Series B common stock will have ten votes per share, in each
case, that our records show were owned as of the record date. The holders of record of our Series C common stock are not entitled to vote, except as required by Delaware law, and may not
vote on the proposals to be presented at the special meeting

Voting by CommerceHub's Directors and Executive Officers 

        The directors of CommerceHub have informed CommerceHub that, as of the date of this proxy statement and to the extent they own shares of voting stock, they intend to vote in favor of
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, although none of them has an obligation to do so. In addition, the directors of CommerceHub have informed CommerceHub that, as of the date of
this proxy statement and to the extent they own shares of voting stock, they intend to vote in favor of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal. At 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the record date, our directors owned, in the aggregate, less than 1% of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding shares of voting stock, and none of our executive
officers owned any shares of voting stock.

Voting by Certain CommerceHub Stockholders 

        In connection with the merger agreement, on March 5, 2018, Parent and CommerceHub entered into the voting agreement with the trust, with respect to its shares of common stock. As of
the record date, the trust beneficially owned 101,164 shares of Series A common stock and 659,081 shares of Series B common stock, collectively representing, in the aggregate, approximately
32.3% of the aggregate voting power represented by the voting stock. As of the record date, the trust also beneficially owned 1,274,657 shares of Series C common stock.

        Pursuant to the voting agreement, the trust agreed, among other things and subject to certain conditions, to, at any meeting of stockholders of CommerceHub called to vote to adopt the
merger agreement, vote all shares of voting stock beneficially owned by the trust in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and to vote against certain other matters that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or interfere with the consummation of the merger, so long as such obligations have not terminated in accordance with the terms set forth in the voting
agreement. Based on these arrangements, as of the record date, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least an additional 17.8%

of the aggregate voting power of the shares of voting stock outstanding (exclusive of those held by the trust), voting together as a single class, is required in order to approve the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement.

        The trust also agreed, until the earliest of the effective time or the expiration date, to not (A) solicit proxies or become a participant in a solicitation in favor of any alternative transaction
proposal, (B) initiate a stockholders' vote with respect to any alternative transaction proposal or (C) become a member of a group with respect to any voting securities of CommerceHub with
respect to any alternative transaction proposal.

        The trust also agreed, until the earliest of (a) the effective time, (b) the termination of the merger agreement or (c) the outside date, to certain transfer restrictions including (i) restrictions
on selling, transferring or disposing of shares of common stock and (ii) restrictions on the ability to enter into voting agreements or to grant proxies or powers of attorney with respect to its
common stock, in each case, subject to certain exceptions.

        Parent agreed to pay the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the trust in connection with the voting agreement in an amount not to exceed $75,000 and
CommerceHub agreed to indemnify the trust and its trustees, beneficiaries, representatives and advisors for losses relating to or arising out of the voting agreement or merger agreement.

        A copy of the voting agreement is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation 

        Attendance.    All holders of shares of common stock as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the record date, including stockholders of record and beneficial owners of common stock
registered in the "street name" of a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, are invited to attend the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, please be prepared to provide proper
identification, such as a driver's license. If you hold your shares in "street name," you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or voting instruction form
provided by your broker, bank, trust, or other nominee or other similar evidence of ownership, along with proper identification.

        Voting in Person.    Stockholders of record of voting stock will be able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record of voting stock, but instead hold your
shares of voting stock in "street name" through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you must provide a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee in order
to be able to vote in person at the special meeting.

        Submitting a Proxy or Providing Voting Instructions.    To ensure that your shares of voting stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions
promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person.

• Shares Held by Record Holder.  If you are a stockholder of record of voting stock, you may submit a proxy using one of the methods described below. 

• Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for submitting voting instructions. You may
vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the Internet by accessing the Internet address as specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares will be voted
as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated, and returned your proxy card, as described below. 

• Submit a Proxy Card by Mail. If you complete, sign, date, and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in time for the special meeting, your shares
will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card.

Table of Contents

        If you sign, date, and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote on a proposal, your proxy will be voted in accordance with our board's recommendation—i.e., in
favor of (i) the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (ii) the advisory compensation proposal, and (iii) the adjournment proposal. If you are a stockholder of record of voting stock and fail
to return your proxy card, unless you attend the special meeting and vote in person, the effect will be that your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present at the special meeting and will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but will not affect the other proposals.

• Shares Held in "Street Name".  If your shares of voting stock are held in "street name," you will receive instructions from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee that you
must follow in order to have your shares voted. Your broker, bank, trust or other nominee will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote. Please follow
the directions on the voting instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank, trust or other nominee with this proxy statement. If you have not received such voting instructions
or require further information regarding such voting instructions, contact your broker, bank, trust or other nominee, as the case may be. Brokers who hold shares of voting stock
in "street name" for a beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on "routine" proposals when they have not received instructions
from the beneficial owner. However, brokers are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to the approval of matters that are "non-routine," such as adoption
of the merger agreement, without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker or other nominee that are present in person or
represented at the meeting, but with respect to which the broker or other nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares to vote on the particular proposal and
the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because all proposals for the special meeting are non-routine and non-discretionary, there will not be any
broker non-votes for such proposals.

        Revocation of Proxies.    Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it any time before it is voted. If you are a stockholder of record of
voting stock, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting by:

• submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures described above, or by completing, signing, dating, and returning a
new proxy card by mail to CommerceHub; 

• attending the special meeting and voting in person; or 

• delivering to the Secretary of CommerceHub a written notice of revocation c/o CommerceHub, Inc., 201 Fuller Road, 6th Floor, Albany, New York 12203, Attn: Secretary.

        Attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new
proxy card to CommerceHub or by sending a written notice of revocation to CommerceHub, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation in sufficient
time for it to be received by CommerceHub before the special meeting.

        If you hold your shares of voting stock in "street name" through a bank, broker, trust or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to you by your bank, broker, trust
or other nominee in order to revoke your voting instructions or submit new voting instructions.

Adjournments and Postponements 

        Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. We are submitting a proposal for consideration at
the special meeting to authorize the named proxies to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting,

if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of
the special meeting. The adjournment proposal relates only to an adjournment of the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting) for purposes of soliciting
additional proxies to obtain the requisite stockholder approval to adopt the merger agreement. CommerceHub retains full authority to the extent set forth in its bylaws and Delaware law to
adjourn the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting) for any other purpose, or to postpone the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement of the
special meeting) before it is convened, without the consent of any CommerceHub stockholder.

        If the special meeting is adjourned, we are not required to give notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting if announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless
the adjournment is for more than 30 days or our board fixes a new record date for the special meeting. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been
transacted at the original meeting. All proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the special meeting, except for any proxies that
have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at the reconvened meeting.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        Our directors, officers, and employees may solicit proxies on our behalf in person, by telephone, email or facsimile. These persons will not be paid additional remuneration for their
efforts. CommerceHub has also engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies and provide related advice and informational support, for a services fee of $7,500, plus
customary disbursements. We also will request brokers and other fiduciaries to forward proxy solicitation material to the beneficial owners of shares of common stock that the brokers and
fiduciaries hold of record. Upon request, we will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. CommerceHub will pay all expenses of filing, printing, and mailing this proxy
statement, including solicitation expenses.

Stockholder List 

        A list of CommerceHub stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for inspection at the special meeting and for ten days prior to the special meeting for any
purpose germane to the special meeting, between the hours of 8:45 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., local time, at our principal executive offices at 201 Fuller Road, 6th Floor, Albany, New York 12203, by
contacting the Secretary of CommerceHub.

        You should not return your stock certificate or send documents representing common stock with the proxy card. If the merger is completed, the exchange agent for the merger will send
you a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock for the merger consideration.

THE MERGER (PROPOSAL 1) 

General 

        If the merger agreement is adopted by CommerceHub stockholders and all other conditions to the closing of the merger are either satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into
CommerceHub. CommerceHub will be the surviving corporation in the merger and will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding
share of common stock (other than shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or CommerceHub, and any dissenting shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive $22.75 in cash,
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

        Our Series A common stock and Series C common stock are traded on the Nasdaq under the symbols "CHUBA" and "CHUBK," respectively, and our Series B common stock is traded on
the OTC Markets under the symbol "CHUBB". If the merger is completed, CommerceHub will cease to be an independent public company and will become a subsidiary of Parent. Following
the completion of the merger, the registration of our Series A common stock and Series C common stock and our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act will be terminated. In addition,
upon the completion of the merger, our common stock will no longer be listed on any stock exchange or quotation system, including the Nasdaq or the OTC Markets.

Recommendation of CommerceHub's Board of Directors 

        Our board has unanimously approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including
without limitation, the merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, CommerceHub and its stockholders. Our board unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote "FOR" the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Background of the Merger 

        Subsequent to the Spin-Off, the board regularly considered various strategic alternatives to increase stockholder value. In particular, during the spring and summer of 2017, management
of CommerceHub considered exploring, among other things, the availability of potential acquisition targets that would be complementary to and potentially synergistic with the business of
CommerceHub. In June 2017, in connection with its ongoing review, the board authorized management to begin the process of engaging a financial advisor to assist CommerceHub in
considering its strategic alternatives. Evercore, which was selected by CommerceHub to assist CommerceHub based primarily on Evercore's expertise in the software industry, began to help
management consider specific acquisition targets. None of these targets engaged with CommerceHub beyond the preliminary discussions phase. In anticipation of the August 23, 2017 meeting
of the board, CommerceHub requested that Evercore prepare a preliminary review of potential alternatives for CommerceHub, including (i) potential acquisitions, (ii) continued focus on
organic growth through investment in CommerceHub's existing capabilities and (iii) a possible sale of CommerceHub.

        On August 23, 2017, at a meeting of the board, with members of management and Evercore in attendance, Evercore presented and discussed with the board its preliminary review of
various strategic alternatives that CommerceHub could consider. With regard to CommerceHub's ability to grow through acquisitions, the board discussed with Evercore potential acquisition
targets available to CommerceHub and possible integration efforts that may be necessary to achieve potential synergies following their acquisition. It was also discussed that certain businesses
in the same industry as CommerceHub were being valued at multiples that would make it costly for CommerceHub to complete an acquisition. With regard to a strategy focused on organic
growth, the board discussed with Evercore potential strategies for revenue growth and related risks. Lastly, with regard to the possibility

Table of Contents

of a sale of CommerceHub, the board discussed with Evercore potential bidders. Following these discussions, the board resolved to engage Evercore formally as its financial advisor to assist
CommerceHub in further exploring strategic alternatives. With regard to next steps, and after conferring with Evercore, the board determined that strategic purchasers might be more attractive
potential acquirers than financial purchasers because they could potentially offer higher prices due to greater potential synergies with their existing businesses, and because such companies are
generally subject to lower financing risk and could complete due diligence review quickly and efficiently. The board instructed Evercore to first contact a number of potential strategic
purchasers to assess their interest in acquiring CommerceHub, after which, at the direction of the board, Evercore and management would conduct a broader process that would involve
potential financial purchasers. At this meeting, CommerceHub's General Counsel also discussed with the directors their fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        For the next several weeks, at the board's direction, Evercore contacted a number of potential strategic purchasers to assess their interest in acquiring CommerceHub.

        On October 6, 2017, CommerceHub executed an engagement letter with Evercore for Evercore to serve as CommerceHub's financial advisor, which engagement had been approved by
the board on August 23.

        By early October 2017, Evercore had contacted nine strategic parties from a variety of industries, each of which CommerceHub felt, and Evercore agreed, would be parties potentially
interested in a strategic transaction with CommerceHub. All of the strategic parties contacted ultimately declined to proceed, although two such parties entered into non-disclosure agreements
with CommerceHub and attended meetings with management prior to declining. These strategic parties cited a number of reasons to Evercore for their decision not to move forward, including
lack of fit within the potential purchaser's strategy. However, one of the strategic parties (Strategic A) requested that Evercore contact it if and when Evercore thought a sale of CommerceHub
may be likely.

        On October 19, 2017, at a meeting of the board attended by members of management and Evercore, the board was provided with a summary of the outreach process to date, including the
potential purchasers approached, a summary of exploratory meetings that occurred with potential counterparties, and the lack of interest of any of the contacted parties in entering into a
transaction to acquire CommerceHub (other than Strategic A's interest in being contacted at a later time). At the meeting, the board evaluated whether it should also contact potential financial
purchasers and whether a transaction with a financial purchaser may be attainable on terms that would be favorable to CommerceHub's stockholders. Following discussion, the board instructed
management to continue working with Evercore to identify select potential financial purchasers of CommerceHub and proceed to contact such potential financial purchasers.

        Accordingly, and at the direction of the board, over the next several weeks, Evercore proceeded to contact seven potential financial purchasers, including GTCR. Evercore also contacted
one additional strategic party owned by a financial sponsor, which declined to pursue the acquisition of CommerceHub. Of the seven potential financial purchasers contacted, five of them
(including GTCR) entered into non-disclosure agreements with CommerceHub by mid-November and two elected not to proceed. After initially entering into a non-disclosure agreement with
CommerceHub, an additional one of the potential financial purchasers declined to participate shortly thereafter. Certain of the non-disclosure agreements entered into between CommerceHub
and potential purchasers included a standstill and certain restrictions on the potential purchasers' ability to request a waiver of such standstill from CommerceHub. All such provisions other
than those applicable to Sponsor B fell away upon entry by CommerceHub into the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

        The remaining four potential financial purchasers, including GTCR, expressed an interest in participating in a sales process. Over the ensuing weeks, Evercore and CommerceHub
representatives held a series of exploratory meetings with each of the four potential financial purchasers.

        On December 4, 2017, at a meeting of the board attended by members of management and Evercore, Evercore provided a summary of developments in the outreach to potential
purchasers, including a discussion of the parties approached and a summary of exploratory meetings that occurred with the potential purchasers. As part of that discussion, a member of the
board disclosed that he was an executive officer of a company which was owned by a fund managed by one of the potential purchasers (Sponsor A) that Evercore had approached on behalf of
CommerceHub but that he expected to transition to an advisory role in the near term at such company in connection with its pending merger. The director disclosed the details of his
relationship with Sponsor A, including a passive minority interest in a Sponsor A affiliate fund in connection with his role as an executive officer of the company, and advised the board that he
had no disclosure obligations to Sponsor A with respect to CommerceHub. He further informed the board that, given the attenuated nature of his relationships with Sponsor A, those
relationships would not, in his opinion, impede his ability to consider the opportunities being explored in a disinterested manner and to act in the best interests of CommerceHub. Following the
ensuing discussion regarding such relationships, the board members, excluding the director who initiated the discussion, unanimously determined that, in light of the attenuated nature of the
director's relationship with Sponsor A, the director was disinterested and that his insights and participation would be valuable to the board's review and in the best interests of CommerceHub.
Following discussion, the board determined to invite the remaining four potential financial purchasers to submit indications of interest in acquiring CommerceHub for the board to further
evaluate, although the board did not definitively determine that CommerceHub would accept an offer or agree to sell CommerceHub.

        On December 5, 2017, one of the potential financial purchasers declined to participate further.

        On December 6, 2017, at the direction of CommerceHub, Evercore sent process letters containing bid instructions and procedures to each of the remaining potential purchasers, requesting
that interested parties submit preliminary indications of interest and an indicative price by December 21, 2017. Also during mid-December 2017, at the direction of management, Evercore
provided to the potential purchasers a set of preliminary draft projections prepared by management of CommerceHub in connection with the sales process, which were prepared applying
aggressive assumptions about the prospects of the business, including assumptions about new initiatives such as the international expansion of CommerceHub's operations.

        On or about December 21, 2017, on the basis of their initial management meetings and prior to commencing further due diligence review, each of GTCR and Sponsor A submitted a
preliminary indication of interest and the other potential financial purchaser declined to participate further in the process based on their inability to offer a price they believed would be
attractive to CommerceHub and its stockholders. In its submission, GTCR indicated a total equity value of CommerceHub of $1.027 billion, representing a price of $22.09 per share for each
series of common stock. Sponsor A indicated a price of $24.00 to $25.00 per share for each series of common stock. Shortly after its review of the submissions, CommerceHub instructed
Evercore to inform GTCR and Sponsor A that CommerceHub would respond to the bids at the start of the new year.

        On January 2, 2018, during a status update call with the board, with members of management and Evercore in attendance, Evercore reviewed the two submissions with the board and its
preliminary financial analysis (taking into account, at the direction of management, the preliminary draft projections that had been recently provided to the potential purchasers), following
which the board determined that CommerceHub should proceed with discussions with both GTCR and Sponsor A. The

board directed CommerceHub's management to make additional due diligence information available to each of GTCR and Sponsor A.

        On January 8, 2018, representatives of CommerceHub contacted Strategic A, in response to its earlier request, to inform Strategic A that a potential transaction involving CommerceHub
may be likely. Strategic A declined to proceed.

        On January 11, 2018, a financial purchaser that was not one of the financial purchasers Evercore had approached in October 2017 independently contacted Evercore to express its
potential interest in a transaction with CommerceHub. Evercore promptly informed CommerceHub of this unsolicited request. However, when asked to formalize their interest in
CommerceHub through a written expression of interest, the potential purchaser declined to do so and did not participate further.

        On January 12, 2018, CommerceHub opened a virtual data room to allow GTCR and Sponsor A to conduct a detailed documentary due diligence review, and thereafter the two potential
purchasers engaged in multiple follow-up due diligence calls and requested additional information regarding various aspects of CommerceHub's business, including industry trends,
technology, tax, accounting and other areas of review.

        On January 17, 2018, at the direction of CommerceHub, Evercore sent process letters containing bid instructions and procedures, and CommerceHub provided a proposed form of merger
agreement, to each of GTCR and Sponsor A, requesting second round proposals and comments to the proposed form of merger agreement by January 26, 2018. Each of the bidders was
instructed to assume that shares of each series of common stock would receive the same per share consideration. The proposed form of merger agreement contemplated, among other things,
that the purchaser would provide a full equity backstop to finance the entire purchase price, with no limitation on damages owed by the purchaser in the event of certain termination events,
including a financing failure, no voting commitment by Mr. Malone, an unlimited ability of the board to change its recommendation to stockholders to support the transaction, no right of
expense reimbursement for the purchaser in the event the stockholders did not approve the transaction and no survival of liability of CommerceHub for its breach in the event the transaction
did not close. Also on that day and the following day, CommerceHub's management team met with each of GTCR and Sponsor A in New York, New York for an additional round of day-long
in-person due diligence review sessions.

        On January 19, 2018, another financial purchaser (Sponsor B) that was not one of the financial purchasers Evercore had approached in October 2017 independently contacted Evercore to
express its potential interest in a transaction with CommerceHub. Evercore promptly informed CommerceHub of this unsolicited request. In response, at the direction of management, Evercore
requested that Sponsor B submit a written indication of interest for the board's consideration.

        On January 23, 2018, Sponsor A contacted Evercore to communicate that, after additional due diligence review, it was no longer prepared to submit an offer within its initial bid range of
$24.00 to $25.00 per share. Sponsor A did not participate further in the process to explore strategic alternatives.

        On January 26, 2018, CommerceHub received a second-round proposal from GTCR together with a marked merger agreement showing GTCR's proposed changes to the draft initially
provided by CommerceHub. GTCR's proposal indicated its interest in an acquisition of CommerceHub at a price of $23.00 per share. GTCR's proposal was supported by an equity
commitment letter for $680 million and three "highly confident" letters for the debt financing. GTCR's proposed draft merger agreement included, among other things, (a) a request for a voting
agreement from Mr. Malone supporting the merger and (b) a financing structure that contemplated the securing of debt financing commitments, coupled with a reverse termination fee of 5% of
the proposed equity value of the transaction to be payable to CommerceHub and guaranteed by GTCR in the event of certain termination events, including a financing failure (notwithstanding
CommerceHub's request that any proposal contemplate a

full equity backstop by GTCR for the aggregate purchase price). The draft merger agreement also limited the ability of the board to change its recommendation to stockholders to support the
transaction, a right of Parent to reimbursement of its expenses up to $5 million in the event the stockholders did not approve the transaction and a termination fee of 4% of the proposed equity
value of the transaction to be payable to Parent in the event that the board approved a superior proposal and in certain other cases. GTCR also requested that it be granted a period of
exclusivity during the negotiations (which was never granted) and access to management, at the appropriate time, to discuss their continued employment with CommerceHub following the
closing of the proposed transaction. Also, on January 26, 2018, CommerceHub received an initial indication of interest from Sponsor B, with a price range of $23.00 to $25.00 per share.

        On or about January 28, 2018, following consultation with a working group consisting of members of the board, management and Evercore (the working group), Evercore, at the
direction of CommerceHub, contacted GTCR and Sponsor B and informed them that CommerceHub would continue to negotiate with them on the terms of the proposed transaction but that
each party would be expected to improve the terms of its proposal, including increasing its proposed purchase price and providing for terms that provided greater certainty of closing for
CommerceHub. In particular, Evercore expressed, at the direction of CommerceHub, to GTCR and Sponsor B that CommerceHub expected any proposal to provide for a full equity backstop
to finance the entire purchase price under the transaction.

        Following the submission of its proposal, GTCR communicated to Evercore that it desired to partner with Sycamore as joint bidders, because it desired to partner with a firm with
expertise in retail investing and that could provide additional capital to pursue the transaction. Evercore had not previously contacted Sycamore in October 2017 and Sycamore had no prior
involvement in the process to explore strategic alternatives. CommerceHub agreed to consider the inclusion of Sycamore on the condition that such inclusion would not slow the pace of the
discussions. At the direction of CommerceHub, Evercore requested that GTCR and Sycamore submit a revised markup to the merger agreement reflecting any changes necessary as a result of
the involvement of Sycamore in the transaction to ensure no material changes would be required as a result of the involvement of Sycamore.

        On January 29, 2018, CommerceHub executed a non-disclosure agreement with Sponsor B and opened the virtual data room to representatives of Sponsor B.

        On January 30, 2018, the board held an update call, with members of management, Evercore and Baker Botts, counsel to CommerceHub, in attendance, to discuss the indications of
interest that had been received, including the terms and conditions of GTCR's second-round proposal and GTCR's previous request to partner with Sycamore as a joint bidder. Following
discussion, the board instructed management and, to assist management, Evercore to continue negotiating with GTCR, to begin engaging with Sycamore and to continue providing Sponsor B
with the opportunity to advance a proposal. The potential for discussions between GTCR and Sycamore, on the one hand, and Mr. Poore and other members of management, on the other hand,
regarding the terms of any post-transaction co-investment, employment or equity packages was also discussed, and Mr. Poore was instructed not to engage in any such discussions until
authorized by the board. Thereafter, CommerceHub conducted a management meeting with Sponsor B in New York, New York, and, over the ensuing days, management continued to fulfill
Sponsor B's due diligence requests to facilitate its ability to submit a proposal.

        On February 1, 2018, CommerceHub entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Sycamore.

        On February 8, 2018, GTCR and Sycamore sent to Evercore a revised marked merger agreement showing GTCR's and Sycamore' proposed changes to the draft merger agreement as
initially provided by CommerceHub. The revised marked merger agreement reflected no material changes from the terms initially proposed by GTCR on January 26. Also on February 8, 2018,
a representative of

Kirkland & Ellis LLP (Kirkland), counsel to GTCR and Sycamore, contacted a representative of Baker Botts and informed Baker Botts that Sycamore would not be proposing additional
material changes to the marked merger agreement submitted on January 26 and that GTCR and Sycamore were prepared to negotiate the merger agreement promptly. In addition, GTCR
acknowledged to members of the working group that it would not have any discussions with respect to any post-transaction co-investment, employment and equity package with any members
of management until the board had authorized management to engage in such discussions.

        Also on February 8, 2018, CommerceHub conducted an additional all-day management meeting with Sponsor B in Albany, NY.

        On the evening of February 8, 2018, Mr. Poore and representatives of GTCR and Sycamore had a dinner to discuss CommerceHub and its business. As previously instructed, there were
no discussions regarding the terms of a post-transaction co-investment, employment and equity package for Mr. Poore or any other members of management.

        On February 9, 2018, a new financial purchaser that was not one of the potential financial purchasers Evercore had approached in October 2017 independently contacted Evercore to
inquire about the sale process. Evercore promptly informed CommerceHub of this unsolicited inquiry. This party did not, however, proceed beyond its initial inquiry notwithstanding the
opportunity provided to it to participate.

        On February 11, 2018, Baker Botts returned comments to Kirkland on the marked merger agreement provided by Kirkland on February 8. The revised merger agreement contemplated a
full equity backstop for the aggregate purchase price, deleted the right of Parent to receive reimbursement of its expenses in the event the stockholders did not approve the transaction, and
included a termination fee equal to 2.5% of the proposed equity value of the transaction to be payable to Parent in the event that the board approved a superior proposal and in certain other
cases. The revised merger agreement also extended to Parent only limited rights to terminate the merger agreement or enforce remedies for CommerceHub's activities related to alternative
transactions. Over the course of the next several weeks Kirkland and Baker Botts exchanged further drafts of the merger agreement.

        On February 12, 2018, Sponsor B communicated to Evercore that it would not proceed further with the sale process and stated that it would not be able to offer a bid price that would be
attractive to CommerceHub's stockholders.

        On February 14, 2018, Kirkland and Baker Botts held a teleconference to negotiate several unresolved terms of the transaction as reflected in their recent drafts of the merger agreement.
In particular, Kirkland communicated to Baker Botts that GTCR and Sycamore would not enter into the transaction unless it reflected their view of a customary model for a leveraged buyout
by a private equity sponsor, including with liability limited to a reverse termination fee payable in certain termination scenarios, such as Parent's failure to close the merger due to a financing
failure, and customary provisions related to CommerceHub's non-solicitation covenant and fiduciary termination rights.

        On February 15, 2018, Kirkland sent Baker Botts a draft of a proposed voting agreement for Mr. Malone, which included a covenant to vote in favor of the proposed transaction, and
Baker Botts referred Kirkland to Mr. Malone's counsel to discuss the proposed agreement terms.

        On the afternoon of February 15, 2018, Mr. Poore and representatives of GTCR and Sycamore had a lunch to discuss CommerceHub and its business. As previously instructed, there were
no discussions regarding the terms of a post-transaction co-investment, employment and equity package for Mr. Poore or any other members of management.

        On February 16, 2018, GTCR and Sycamore submitted an updated proposal indicating a price of $22.00 per share, together with executed debt commitment letters from lenders, noting
that they and their advisors had completed their due diligence, with relatively minor confirmatory items remaining. GTCR and Sycamore did not state a reason for the reduction in the bid
price, although from subsequent discussions, CommerceHub understood that the reduction was due to the bidders' perception that their initial pricing model had assumed a significantly more
optimistic view of the growth opportunities available to CommerceHub, and their subsequent review, which resulted in a revised model, indicated that they could not support the higher
valuation initially proposed. In addition, the updated proposal requested an opportunity, at the appropriate time, to discuss with Mr. Poore his willingness to serve as the Chief Executive
Officer of CommerceHub following the closing. Discussions as to the terms of the updated bid proposal were held between the parties and their respective advisors, with all parties agreeing
that any discussions between Mr. Poore and other members of management, on the one hand, and GTCR and Sycamore, on the other hand, regarding the terms of any post-transaction co-
investment, employment and equity package would have to wait until the transaction was further advanced. Ultimately, GTCR and Sycamore had discussions with Mr. Poore with respect to
these matters on and after February 27, 2018, after the parties had reached an agreement on price and certain other key transaction terms.

        On February 18, 2018, following consultation with the working group, Mr. Poore informed representatives of GTCR and Sycamore that he did not believe the $22.00 offer price would be
viewed favorably by the board. Later that day, GTCR and Sycamore verbally indicated to CommerceHub an increased proposal of $22.50 per share.

        On February 19, 2018, the board held an update call, with members of management, Evercore and Baker Botts in attendance, to discuss the status of the negotiations with GTCR and
Sycamore, during which the board discussed the terms of the most recent proposal, including the proposed per-share purchase price and the outstanding issues with regard to the negotiation of
the merger agreement and the various other transaction documents. At the meeting, management presented to the board a definitive set of projections (the Projections) that management
considered to be the most reliable indicators of CommerceHub's future performance, and on which management expressly instructed Evercore to rely for purposes of Evercore's fairness
analysis if a fairness analysis were to be requested by the board in connection with the proposed transaction. The board reviewed with management the assumptions on which the Projections
were based and independently considered whether it determined them to be current and the best estimates of the future financial performance of CommerceHub. Following discussion, the
board approved the Projections for use by Evercore for its analysis of the proposed transaction. See "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Projected Financial Information". In addition, following
discussion, the board directed Mr. Poore to contact representatives of GTCR and Sycamore and continue negotiations with the objective of improving the proposed offer price.

        On February 20, 2018, Mr. Poore conveyed the message of the board to representatives of GTCR and Sycamore, as so directed. He indicated that the board wanted to determine whether
GTCR and Sycamore would be prepared to reach a price that the board would find acceptable before conducting further negotiation on the other terms of the merger agreement that remained
unresolved. Later that day, at GTCR and Sycamore' request, Baker Botts sent to Kirkland a list of unresolved issues related to the merger agreement, including the equity backstop for the
aggregate purchase price, the size of the termination fee, the obligation of CommerceHub to reaffirm its recommendation to the stockholders in support of the transaction and whether the
outside date at which parties can terminate the merger agreement could be extended. On February 21, 2018, Baker Botts and Kirkland discussed these issues, and on February 22, 2018, Baker
Botts sent a revised merger agreement reflecting the views of CommerceHub on these issues. On February 23, 2018, Kirkland sent to Baker Botts a revised merger agreement reflecting the
views of GTCR and Sycamore on these issues, including a termination fee of

3% of the proposed equity value of the transaction and a reverse termination fee of 5.5% of the proposed equity value of the transaction.

        On February 24, 2018, GTCR and Sycamore contacted Evercore and verbally indicated an increased proposal of $22.60 per share. In addition, GTCR and Sycamore again requested an
opportunity, at the appropriate time, to discuss with Mr. Poore his willingness to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of CommerceHub following the closing. In response, CommerceHub
representatives, led by Mr. Poore, contacted representatives of GTCR and Sycamore to discuss additional details of the increased financial proposal. However, no discussions were held with
respect to Mr. Poore's willingness to continue with CommerceHub following any transaction with GTCR and Sycamore until February 27, 2018.

        On February 25, 2018, the board held a telephonic meeting, with members of management, Evercore and Baker Botts in attendance, to discuss the status of the negotiations with GTCR
and Sycamore. At the meeting, a representative of Baker Botts reviewed with the board and senior management their fiduciary duties and related considerations, and Evercore provided the
board with a preliminary analysis of the $22.60 offer price. Following discussion among the board and its advisors regarding alternatives available to CommerceHub, including the potential to
continue as a standalone business, and the status of the negotiations with regard to the merger agreement and the other transaction documents, the board determined that, subject to acceptable
resolution of remaining open points, accepting the offer price was in the best interests of CommerceHub and its stockholders. On that basis, the board requested its Chairman, Mr. Baer, to
contact GTCR and Sycamore in an attempt to negotiate an increase above the $22.60 offer price (and to address certain other open issues), but authorized Mr. Baer to not further negotiate such
price on behalf of CommerceHub if such further efforts were unsuccessful. The board also authorized Mr. Poore to begin negotiations with GTCR and Sycamore regarding the terms of a post-
transaction co-investment, employment and equity package after Mr. Baer's negotiations were completed. Following this discussion, the representatives from Evercore, all members of
management (other than Mr. Poore), Mr. Huseby and Ms. Morgan departed the meeting. In addition, the members of the board who are employees of Liberty Media Corporation (Liberty
Media), i.e., Messrs. Baer, Hollingsworth and Wendling, recused themselves from the meeting in light of their relationship with Mr. Malone (who is the Chairman of the Board of Liberty
Media). The remaining board members were apprised of an open issue with respect to Mr. Malone's voting agreement. It was noted that Mr. Malone was unwilling to execute the voting
agreement without receiving indemnification from GTCR and Sycamore, or, alternatively, from CommerceHub. Kirkland had informed Baker Botts and Mr. Malone's counsel that GTCR and
Sycamore were unwilling to proceed without a voting agreement from Mr. Malone, were unwilling to provide this indemnification and expected CommerceHub to provide the indemnity. In
light of these circumstances, the remaining board members (other than Messrs. Baer, Hollingsworth, Huseby and Wendling and Ms. Morgan, each of whom had departed from the meeting
shortly before), constituting a majority of CommerceHub's independent directors, unanimously agreed that it would be advisable and in the best interests of CommerceHub and its stockholders
for CommerceHub to provide this indemnification in order to enable the transaction to proceed and unanimously recommended that the board authorize CommerceHub to provide such
indemnification if the board approved the transaction with GTCR and Sycamore.

        Following the board meeting, Mr. Baer contacted a representative of GTCR and informed him that the board expected that GTCR and Sycamore would increase their proposed purchase
price and that certain other terms of the merger agreement had to be changed, including increasing the reverse termination fee to 7% of the equity value of the transaction, improving the
certainty of the transaction closing and making other changes to the merger agreement to make the deal protections less favorable to GTCR and Sycamore.

        Later that day, representatives of GTCR indicated to Mr. Baer that they believed the offer price could be increased to $22.75, and Baker Botts sent to Kirkland a revised version of the
merger agreement.

        On February 26, 2018, GTCR and Sycamore confirmed verbally that their best and final proposal was $22.75 per share, with a reverse termination fee equal to 6% of the proposed equity
value of the transaction, and that their offer was conditioned on reaching an agreement as to acceptable terms of a post-transaction co-investment, employment and equity package with
Mr. Poore. They indicated that they expected all remaining unresolved terms in the merger agreement were relatively immaterial. Because members of the working group believed further
attempts to increase the offer price would not be successful, and potentially counter-productive, and with the prior authorization of the board, CommerceHub reached an agreement on price
and certain other key transaction terms with GTCR and Sycamore with the understanding that the offer being made by GTCR and Sycamore was specifically conditioned on their reaching
agreement with Mr. Poore on the terms of a post-transaction co-investment, employment and equity package, as well as the parties reaching agreement on the remaining open issues with
respect to the merger agreement and the other transaction documents and the board's approval of the final terms and conditions of the proposed transaction. Baker Botts communicated to
Kirkland that the parties were authorized to commence discussions regarding the terms of Mr. Poore's post-transaction co-investment, employment and equity package with GTCR and
Sycamore.

        On February 27, 2018, representatives of GTCR and Sycamore met with Mr. Poore in Saratoga Springs, New York to address the terms of his post-transaction co-investment,
compensation and equity package, after which GTCR and Sycamore provided Mr. Poore with a term sheet outlining their proposal for the key terms of his investment in Parent at the closing of
the proposed transaction and his post-transaction compensation and equity package. Later that day, following Mr. Poore's review of the proposal, Mr. Poore informed Mr. Baer and
CommerceHub's advisors that the proposal was not acceptable to him and that substantial changes would need to be negotiated.

        On February 28, 2018, given the extent of the difference in views with respect to Mr. Poore's proposed investment in Parent, GTCR and Sycamore determined that they had not been able
to reach agreement with him on mutually acceptable terms and determined not to proceed with further negotiations on the transaction. As a result, GTCR and Sycamore communicated this
decision to CommerceHub by a call from a representative of GTCR to Mr. Baer. Following that discussion, later that day, the board held an update call, with members of management,
Evercore and Baker Botts in attendance, to discuss the status of the negotiations, during which the board was advised that GTCR and Sycamore had still not reached agreement with Mr. Poore
on the terms of a post-transaction co-investment, compensation and equity package and that certain non-price open issues remained with respect to the merger agreement and the other
transaction agreements. Accordingly, the board was advised that there was no transaction to approve. Later that day, CommerceHub announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and
full year ended December 31, 2017, and at the end of the business day held an earnings conference call.

        Late on March 2, 2018, representatives of GTCR and Sycamore contacted Mr. Poore to inquire whether he was still interested in having discussions related to his post-transaction co-
investment, employment and equity package in support of completing an overall transaction. Mr. Poore informed representatives of GTCR that he would be willing to continue to have
discussions of this kind and informed members of the working group that he would commence such discussions. During the ensuing days, Mr. Poore and representatives of GTCR and
Sycamore held discussions about these items. Later in the evening of March 2, 2018, Kirkland contacted Baker Botts to discuss the status of the merger agreement and the other transaction
documents. Throughout the ensuing days, the parties exchanged drafts of the merger agreement and the associated disclosure schedules, as well as Mr. Malone's voting

agreement and the associated financing documents. In addition, Mr. Baer held conversations with representatives of GTCR and Sycamore regarding the final outstanding items in these
agreements.

        By March 4, 2018, despite several discussions, Mr. Poore and representatives of GTCR and Sycamore had not reached agreement on the terms of a post-transaction co-investment,
employment and equity package. Representatives of GTCR and Sycamore suggested to Mr. Poore that they meet in person on March 5 to try to finalize the arrangements documenting
Mr. Poore's post-transaction co-investment, compensation and equity package. On the afternoon of March 4, 2018, Mr. Poore reported to Mr. Baer that the terms of the current proposal with
respect to his post-transaction co-investment, compensation and equity package remained unacceptable to him.

        On March 5, 2018, Mr. Poore met with representatives of GTCR in Chicago, Illinois. Later that day, GTCR and Sycamore revised their proposal to Mr. Poore, which Mr. Poore reported to
Mr. Baer was acceptable to him from an economic perspective but subject to further review by his advisors. During the early evening of March 5, 2018, Mr. Poore and his advisers reached an
agreement as to his post-transaction co-investment, compensation and equity package. For more information on these arrangements, see "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Certain
Persons in the Merger".

        Late in the evening on March 5, 2018, the board held a telephonic meeting, with members of management, Evercore, Baker Botts, and other outside legal counsel to CommerceHub in
attendance, to discuss the terms of the proposed transaction, including the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the other transaction documents, including Mr. Malone's voting
agreement as well as the terms of Mr. Poore's post-transaction co-investment, compensation and equity package. At this meeting, Evercore reviewed with the board its financial analysis of the
merger consideration and delivered an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 5, 2018, to the effect that, based upon and subject to the factors,
procedures, assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in its written opinion, it was Evercore's opinion that, as of the date of the written opinion, the per share merger
consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of common stock (other than the Excluded Stockholders) entitled to receive such per share merger consideration.
For more information, see "Opinion of CommerceHub's Financial Advisor". After the presentation by Evercore, and a discussion with counsel, the board, among other things, unanimously
(i) determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including without limitation, the merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, CommerceHub and its
stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the merger, (iii) authorized officers of
CommerceHub to execute and deliver the merger agreement, (iv) resolved to submit the merger agreement to the stockholders of CommerceHub for their adoption, and (v) recommended that
the stockholders of CommerceHub approve the adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the merger. For more information,
see "Reasons for the Merger". Later that evening, the parties executed the merger agreement and the other transaction documents, including Mr. Malone's voting agreement.

        On March 6, 2018, prior to the opening of stock markets in the United States, the parties issued a joint press release announcing the transaction.

Reasons for the Merger 

        In evaluating the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and in reaching its decision to approve and declare advisable the merger
agreement and to recommend that CommerceHub stockholders approve the adoption of the merger agreement, our board considered a number of factors and a significant amount of
information that it believes

support its determination and recommendation, including the following non-exhaustive list of material factors and benefits (which are not necessarily listed in order of importance):

• Premium to Market Prices.  Our board considered that the merger consideration of $22.75 per share of common stock represents: 

• a 24.5% premium to the Series A common stock closing price as of March 5, 2018; 

• a 19.3% premium to the one-month volume-weighted average Series A common stock closing price as of March 5, 2018; 

• a 30.2% premium to the Series C common stock closing price as of March 5, 2018; and 

• a 27.1% premium to the one-month volume-weighted average Series C common stock closing price as of March 5, 2018. 

• Liquidity and Certainty of Value.  Our board considered that the merger consideration would be paid in all cash, providing value certainty to CommerceHub's stockholders and
allowing them to monetize their investment in CommerceHub, at a premium, in the near future. Our board believed that this certainty of value was compelling compared to the
long-term value creation potential and execution risks underlying the business plan of CommerceHub as a standalone company. In connection with this, our board considered
the inherent uncertainty of achieving the results of the management projections, as summarized below under "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Projected Financial Information." 

• CommerceHub's Business, Financial Condition and Prospects.  Our board considered its in-depth knowledge of our business, financial condition, and prospects, in addition to
the risks and uncertainties associated with achieving and executing on CommerceHub's business and financial plans in the short and long term if CommerceHub were to remain
an independent public company, including market acceptance and performance of our products and services, competitive issues affecting CommerceHub, competitive issues
facing many of CommerceHub's customers, general market conditions, regulatory matters and changes in law affecting our business, and the risk factors described in the 2017
Annual Report. 

• Potential Strategic Alternatives.  Our board considered the possible alternatives to a sale to Parent, including the potential to continue as a standalone business and the pursuit of
an acquisition strategy. Our board evaluated alternatives with the assistance of Evercore, and determined that, when compared to the merger, these alternatives were not in the
best interests of CommerceHub and its stockholders given the relative risks, rewards and uncertainties associated with those alternatives. 

• Quality of the Process to Evaluate Strategic Alternatives.  Our board considered the quality of its process to explore potential transactions, with the assistance of Evercore,
including (i) the solicitation of numerous potential strategic purchasers and potential financial purchasers, (ii) discussions with various parties that contacted Evercore on an
unsolicited basis, (iii) extensive management engagement with potential purchasers, and (iv) detailed review of all proposals received with our board's financial advisors. Our
board further considered that discussions had been held with, and feedback received from, multiple interested or potentially interested parties as part of the process, including
the fact that none of the potential strategic purchasers who were contacted, and none of the parties that contacted Evercore on an unsolicited basis, chose to participate in the
process to pursue strategic alternatives and the fact that neither Sponsor A nor Sponsor B remained in the process. Additionally, our board considered the risk that prolonging
the strategic review process could have resulted in the loss of a favorable opportunity to successfully consummate a transaction with GTCR and Sycamore and was unlikely to
result in a proposal materially better than GTCR and Sycamore's proposal.

• Evercore's Fairness Opinion and Related Analyses.  Our board considered the financial analyses that representatives of Evercore reviewed and discussed with our board, as well
as the oral opinion of Evercore rendered to our board on March 5, 2018 (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Evercore's written opinion dated the same
date) to the effect that, based upon and subject to the factors, procedures, assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in Evercore's written opinion, the
per-share merger consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of CommerceHub common stock (other than the Excluded Stockholders) is fair, from a financial point of view,
to such stockholders, as more fully described below under "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Opinion of CommerceHub's Financial Advisors". 

• Likelihood of Completion.  Our board considered its belief that, absent a superior proposal, the merger represented a transaction that would likely be consummated based on,
among other factors: 

• the reputation and ability of GTCR and Sycamore to complete large acquisition transactions in our industries; 

• the fact that Parent had obtained committed debt and equity financing for the transaction, the number and nature of the conditions to the debt and equity financing, and
the reputation of the financing sources; 

• the absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement; 

• the likelihood and anticipated timing of completing the proposed merger in light of the scope of the conditions to completion, including the fact that there are no
anticipated substantive issues in connection with the HSR Act and other antitrust clearances and that there are no other anticipated regulatory approvals that are required
to close the merger; 

• the fact that the merger agreement provides that, in the event of a failure of the merger to be consummated under certain circumstances, Parent will pay CommerceHub a
$63.0 million reverse termination fee, as described under "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees—Parent Termination Fee," without CommerceHub having to
establish any damages, the payment of which is guaranteed, severally but not jointly, by affiliates of GTCR and affiliates of Sycamore pursuant to their respective
limited guarantees; and 

• our ability, under certain circumstances pursuant to the merger agreement, to seek specific performance to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and the equity
commitment letters, as described under "The Merger Agreement—Specific Performance" and to enforce specifically the terms of the merger agreement and the equity
commitment letters. 

• Ability to Terminate.  Our board considered that, until the date the CommerceHub stockholders approve the adoption of the merger agreement: 

• if CommerceHub receives an unsolicited bona fide written alternative transaction proposal that our board determines in good faith to be, or to be reasonably likely to
lead to, a superior proposal, and our board determines in good faith that failure to take action would be reasonably likely to violate the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable law, CommerceHub may furnish nonpublic information and engage in discussions or negotiations with such person or group with respect to such alternative
transaction proposal; 

• in response to an intervening event or a superior proposal, our board may make a Company adverse recommendation change if it determines, in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable law; and

• in response to a superior proposal, our board may terminate the merger agreement and enter into a superior proposal, subject to certain conditions (including certain
rights of Parent to have an opportunity to propose amendments to the merger agreement), provided that we pay a $31.5 million termination fee. 

• Negotiation Process.  Our board considered the fact that the terms of the merger agreement were the result of robust arm's-length negotiations conducted by CommerceHub,
with the knowledge and at the direction of our board and with the assistance of Evercore and Baker Botts.

        In the course of its deliberations, our board also considered a number of risks, uncertainties and other potentially negative factors associated with the merger agreement, the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the following (which are not necessarily listed in order of importance):

• the fact that CommerceHub stockholders (other than Mr. Poore pursuant to the co-investor agreement) will not participate in any future growth potential or benefit from any
future increase in the value of our company (whether through organic growth, acquisitions or otherwise); 

• the significant costs involved in connection with entering into and completing the merger (including the costs that may be incurred by CommerceHub pursuant to Mr. Malone's
indemnification rights under the voting agreement) and the substantial time and effort of management required to complete the merger and related disruptions to the operation of
our business; 

• the risk that the proposed merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all, including the risk that the proposed merger will not occur if the contemplated financing,
described under "The Merger—Financing," is not obtained, and the effect that the resulting public announcement of termination of the merger agreement could have on the
trading price of our common stock; 

• the fact that, under the terms of the merger agreement, CommerceHub is unable to solicit alternative transaction proposals during the pendency of the merger; 

• the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the closing of the merger, which could delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities or certain other
actions we would otherwise take with respect to our operations pending closing; 

• the potential negative effect that the public announcement and pendency of the merger, or a failure to complete the merger, could have on our business and relationships with
our customers, employees and prospective employees; 

• the risks and costs to us if the proposed merger does not close, including the diversion of management and employee attention from operational matters, potential employee
attrition, the potential effect on our business operations, including our relationships with vendors, customers, partners and others that do business with us, and the potentially
adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock; 

• the possibility that the amounts that may be payable by us upon the termination of the merger agreement could discourage other potential purchasers from making a competing
bid to acquire us, including the possibility of the payment of a termination fee of $31.5 million if we terminate the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal or
materially breach our obligations under the provisions of the merger agreement relating to the solicitation of alternative transaction proposals; 

• the fact that Parent requires significant third-party debt financing to consummate the transaction and that, in the event that the lenders do not provide the debt financing under
the debt

commitment letter, we will not be able to specifically enforce Parent's obligations to complete the merger, in which case our remedy for Parent's failure to close the merger
would be limited to receipt of the reverse termination fee; and

• the fact that the merger will generally be taxable to our stockholders that are U.S. Holders (as defined below in "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger") for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        In addition to the factors described above, our board considered the fact that directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
those of CommerceHub's other stockholders as described in "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Certain Persons".

        The preceding discussion of the information and factors considered by our board is not, and is not intended to be, exhaustive. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection
with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, our board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to rank or assign relative weights to the
various factors considered in reaching its determination. In considering the factors described above and any other factors, individual members of our board may have viewed factors differently
or given different weight, merit or consideration to different factors. In addition, our board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any
aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination, but rather it conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above, including through
discussions with and questioning of representatives of management, Evercore and Baker Botts.

Opinion of CommerceHub's Financial Advisor 

        CommerceHub retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor in connection with evaluating strategic and financial alternatives, including the merger. As part of this engagement,
CommerceHub requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per-share merger consideration to be received by the holders of common stock (other than
the Excluded Stockholders) entitled to receive such merger consideration. At a meeting of the board held on March 5, 2018, Evercore rendered its oral opinion to the board, which opinion was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 5, 2018, that, as of the date thereof, and based upon and subject to the factors, procedures, assumptions, qualifications,
limitations and other matters set forth in its written opinion, the per-share merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of common stock (other than the
Excluded Stockholders) entitled to receive such per-share merger consideration.

        The full text of Evercore's written opinion, dated March 5, 2018, which sets forth, among other things, the factors considered, procedures followed, assumptions made and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Evercore in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety. CommerceHub urges you to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Evercore's opinion was addressed to, and for the information and benefit of, the
board in connection with its evaluation of the merger. Evercore's opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that
might be available to CommerceHub, nor did it address the underlying business decision of CommerceHub to engage in the merger. Evercore's opinion did not constitute a
recommendation to the board or to any other persons in respect of the merger, including as to how any holder of shares of common stock should vote or act with respect to the
merger. The summary of Evercore's opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement. Evercore has consented to the inclusion of its opinion as Annex B to this proxy statement.

        In connection with rendering its opinion, Evercore, among other things:

• reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to CommerceHub that Evercore deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research
analysts' estimates;

Evercore by management of CommerceHub; 

• reviewed (i) the Projections, which consist of certain non-public projected financial data relating to CommerceHub for fiscal years 2018 through 2020 prepared and furnished to
Evercore by management of CommerceHub on February 19, 2018, together with (ii) extrapolations of the Projections for fiscal years 2021 through 2022, based on and
extrapolated from the Projections, and projected unlevered free cash flow (as defined below) for fiscal years 2023 through 2032, furnished to Evercore by management of
CommerceHub (such information described in clause (ii), the Extended Financial Projections); 

• reviewed certain non-public historical and projected operating data relating to CommerceHub prepared and furnished to Evercore by CommerceHub management;

on the risks and uncertainties of achieving such projections); 

• reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Series A common stock, Series B common stock and Series C common stock of CommerceHub and the
premium to be received by the holders of such shares; 

• compared the financial performance of CommerceHub and its stock market trading multiples with those of certain other publicly traded companies that Evercore deemed
relevant; 

• compared the financial performance of CommerceHub and the valuation multiples relating to the merger with those of certain other transactions that Evercore deemed relevant; 

• performed discounted cash flow analyses on CommerceHub based on forecasts and other data prepared by management of CommerceHub; 

• reviewed a draft of the merger agreement, dated March 5, 2018 (the most recent draft made available to Evercore), which Evercore assumed was in substantially final form and
from which Evercore assumed the final form would not vary in any respect material to Evercore's analysis; 

• reviewed a draft of the form of voting agreement, dated March 2, 2018 (the most recent draft made available to Evercore), which Evercore assumed was in substantially final
form and from which Evercore assumed the final form would not vary in any respect material to Evercore's analysis; and 

• performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of Evercore's analysis and opinion, Evercore has assumed and relied upon, without undertaking any independent verification of, the accuracy and completeness of all of the
information publicly available and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by Evercore, and Evercore assumes no liability therefor. With
respect to the Projections and the Extended Financial Projections, Evercore has been advised by management of CommerceHub, and has assumed, at the direction of the board, that they have
been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of management of CommerceHub as to the future financial performance of
CommerceHub. Evercore expresses no view as to the Projections or

Extended Financial Projections or the assumptions on which they are based. Evercore has relied, at the board's direction, without independent verification, upon the assessments of the
management of CommerceHub as to CommerceHub's historical and projected financial performance.

        For purposes of rendering Evercore's opinion, Evercore has assumed, in all respects material to Evercore's analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the
merger agreement and the voting agreement are true and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the merger agreement
and the voting agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the merger will be satisfied without material waiver or modification thereof. Evercore has assumed that each of the
executed merger agreement and voting agreement will conform in all material respects to the drafts Evercore reviewed. Evercore has further assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other
consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any material delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect
on CommerceHub, Parent or Merger Sub or the consummation of the merger or would materially reduce the benefits to the holders of common stock of the merger.

        Evercore has not made nor assumed any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of CommerceHub, nor has Evercore been furnished
with any such appraisals, nor has Evercore evaluated the solvency or fair value of CommerceHub under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters.
Evercore's opinion is necessarily based upon information made available to Evercore as of the date thereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they exist and as could be
evaluated on the date thereof. It was understood that developments subsequent to Evercore's opinion could affect its opinion and that Evercore did not and does not have any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

        Evercore has not been asked to pass upon, and expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to the holders of common stock (other than the Excluded
Stockholders), without regard to differences, including as to relative voting rights, trading volumes, trading value and premiums or otherwise, between or among the Series A common stock,
the Series B common stock and the Series C common stock, from a financial point of view, of the per-share merger consideration. Evercore did not express any view on, and its opinion did not
address, the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration to be received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other securities, creditors or other constituencies of CommerceHub, nor
as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of CommerceHub (including the Chief Executive Officer), or
any class of such persons, whether relative to the per-share merger consideration or otherwise, nor as to the relative fairness of the per-share merger consideration as between holders of the
Series A common stock, Series B common stock, Series C common stock or any combination thereof. Evercore has assumed that any modification to the structure of the transaction will not
vary in any respect material to its analysis. Evercore's opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to
CommerceHub, nor did it address the underlying business decision of CommerceHub to engage in the merger. Evercore's opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the board or to any
other persons in respect of the merger, including as to how any holder of shares of common stock should vote or act in respect of the merger. Evercore expresses no opinion as to the price at
which shares of CommerceHub will trade at any time. Evercore is not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and has assumed the accuracy and completeness of assessments by
CommerceHub and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.

Summary of Material Financial Analyses

        The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses that Evercore reviewed with the board on March 5, 2018, in connection with rendering Evercore's opinion. The
following summary does

not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Evercore. The order of the analyses described and the results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or
weight given to these analyses by Evercore or the board. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data
that existed on or before March 2, 2018 (the last trading date prior to the rendering of Evercore's opinion) and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

        The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analyses and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to summary description.

        In arriving at its opinion, Evercore did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to
fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses. Considering selected portions of the analyses and reviews in the summary
set forth below, without considering the analyses and reviews as a whole, could create an incomplete or misleading view of the analyses and reviews underlying Evercore's opinion.

        For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions, and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of CommerceHub. No company, business or transaction used in Evercore's analyses and reviews as a comparison is identical to CommerceHub, the merger or the per-share
merger consideration, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions used
in Evercore's analyses and reviews. The estimates contained in Evercore's analyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review, are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by Evercore's analyses and reviews. In
addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or securities
actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore's analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

        The following summary of material financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. These tables must be read together with the full text of each summary
in order to understand fully the summary of material financial analyses performed by Evercore. The tables are not intended to stand alone and do not constitute a complete
description of the material financial analyses performed by Evercore. Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the material financial
analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Evercore's financial analyses.

        In performing the financial analyses summarized below, at the instruction of management of CommerceHub, Evercore utilized and relied upon the management case forecasts,
consisting of the Projections and Extended Financial Projections, as described in the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Projected Financial Information," and certain street financial
information.

CommerceHub Trading Multiples Analysis

        Evercore reviewed and compared certain financial and operating information relating to CommerceHub's multiples of total enterprise value (TEV) (based on closing stock prices of the
CommerceHub Series A common stock) to CommerceHub's (x) last 12 months (LTM) EBITDA for each day during the period from January 3, 2017 to March 2, 2018 and (y) estimated next
12 months

(NTM) EBITDA for each day during the period from December 15, 2016 to March 2, 2018. The TEV/LTM EBITDA and TEV/NTM EBITDA multiples were provided by FactSet, an online
investment research and database service.

        The analysis indicated the following with respect to CommerceHub:

        Based upon the information presented in the tables above and the application of Evercore's professional judgment, Evercore selected a reference multiple range in respect of the
10th percentile through the 90th percentile of (x) 18.1x to 23.5x in respect of the TEV/LTM EBITDA, and (y) 15.9x to 19.9x in respect of the TEV/NTM EBITDA. The range was then applied
to CommerceHub's historical adjusted EBITDA (as described below) for fiscal year 2017 (LTM adjusted EBITDA) and projected adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2018 (NTM adjusted
EBITDA), as estimated in the management case forecasts. Evercore determined an implied equity value per share range of $18.24 per share to $23.02 per share, in respect of the LTM adjusted
EBITDA, and $17.92 per share to $21.93 per share, in respect of the NTM adjusted EBITDA, based on the management case forecasts.

        Evercore compared the results of this analysis to the per-share merger consideration of $22.75.

Peer Group Trading Multiples Analysis

        Evercore reviewed and compared certain financial and operating information relating to CommerceHub, including information based on the management case forecasts, to the following
companies: Veeva Systems Inc., Tyler Technologies, Inc., Blackbaud, Inc., RealPage, Inc., Medidata Solutions, Inc., SPS Commerce, Inc., Ellie Mae, Inc., Benefitfocus, Inc. (excluded in
certain analyses as the relevant multiple is not meaningful) and Guidewire Software, Inc. (excluded in certain analyses as the relevant multiple is not meaningful).

        Although none of these companies are directly comparable to CommerceHub, Evercore selected the companies for the peer group trading multiple analysis based on its professional
judgment because these companies had operating characteristics, products and services that, for purposes of its analysis, Evercore considered similar to certain of CommerceHub's operating
characteristics, products and services.

        For each of the selected companies identified above, Evercore calculated multiples of TEV to the metrics shown in the table below for the calendar years identified below based on closing
stock prices as of March 2, 2018, and financial data that Evercore obtained from filings made with the SEC, and consensus estimates based on publicly available equity research analysts'
projections provided by FactSet.

        The analysis indicated the following with respect to the peer group (excluding CommerceHub):

Table of Contents

        Based upon the information presented in the tables above and the application of Evercore's professional judgment, Evercore selected the following reference multiple ranges for the
metrics described in the table below. The range was then applied to the corresponding CommerceHub metric for the applicable time period described in the table below, as estimated in the
management case forecasts. Evercore determined an implied equity value per share range for each applicable metric as set forth in the table below.

        In addition, Evercore noted the applicable multiple for each metric in respect of SPS Commerce, Inc. (SPS Commerce) as a relevant comparable company in respect of the peer group
selected in Evercore's professional judgment. In respect of SPS Commerce, Evercore calculated multiples of TEV to the metrics shown in the table below for the calendar years identified
below based on closing stock prices as of March 2, 2018, and financial data that Evercore obtained from public filings and consensus estimates for SPS Commerce based on publicly available
equity research analysts' projections. The multiple for each metric was then applied to the corresponding CommerceHub metric for the applicable time period described in the table below, as
estimated based on the management case forecasts. Evercore determined an implied equity value per share of CommerceHub's common stock based on the SPS Commerce multiples for each
applicable metric as set forth in the table below.

        Evercore compared the results of these analyses to the per-share merger consideration of $22.75.

Precedent Transactions Analysis

        Evercore reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to 16 precedent transactions (precedent transactions) involving companies that Evercore considered to
be relevant to CommerceHub's business and industry. Evercore selected the precedent transactions because they represented transactions of which Evercore was aware involving companies in
the software industry. Evercore considered, in its professional judgment and experience, these transactions most relevant to the merger. No company, business or transaction used in this
analysis is identical or directly comparable to CommerceHub or the merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general
business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of CommerceHub, such as the impact of competition on the business of
CommerceHub and the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial conditions and prospects of CommerceHub, the industry or in the
financial markets in general. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments

concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the relative values of the selected companies. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the
mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the transaction data of the precedent transactions.

        The precedent transactions are set forth in the table below:

        For each of the precedent transactions, using publicly available information, Evercore reviewed transaction values and calculated the transaction TEV implied for each target company
based on the consideration paid in the precedent transaction as a multiple of the target company's trailing LTM revenue and trailing LTM EBITDA (in each case, calculated for the 12-month
period prior to the latest available data preceding the date of announcement of such transaction), based on company filings and street estimates/analysis. The range of multiples across the
precedent transactions were (i) in the case of TEV/Revenue LTM, 3.3x - 12.8x, and (ii) in the case of TEV/LTM EBITDA, 15.1x - 30.0x.

        Evercore calculated and analyzed the transaction TEV to LTM EBITDA multiples and TEV to LTM revenue multiples of the precedent transactions. Based on the multiples it derived for
the precedent transactions and based on its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a transaction TEV to LTM EBITDA multiple reference range of 21.0x-24.0x to
CommerceHub's EBITDA for CommerceHub's LTM period as of December 31, 2017, and transaction TEV to LTM revenue multiple reference range of 9.0x to 10.0x to CommerceHub's
revenue for CommerceHub's LTM period as of December 31, 2017. This analysis implied an equity value range per share of common stock of: (i) in the case of EBITDA, $20.81 to $23.50,
and (ii) in the case of revenue, $21.74 to $23.93.

        Evercore compared the results of this analysis to the per-share merger consideration of $22.75.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        As part of its analysis, Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of CommerceHub. This is a method used to estimate the implied present value of an asset by calculating the
present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows to be generated by that asset. The present value of those future unlevered free cash flows is then obtained by discounting those
future unlevered free cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital and other appropriate
factors. The "unlevered free cash flow" refers to a calculation of the future cash flows generated by an asset without including in such

calculation any debt servicing costs. Specifically, unlevered free cash flow for this purpose represents earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, less stock based compensation, income tax
expense, capital expenditures, increases in net working capital and certain other cash expenses, as applicable, plus depreciation and amortization.

        Evercore's discounted cash flow analysis was intended to estimate the implied present value, as of December 31, 2017, of (1) the future unlevered free cash flow that CommerceHub
would generate during the period from January 1, 2018, through (x) in the case of the terminal EBITDA multiple methodology, December 31, 2022, and (y) in the case of the perpetuity growth
methodology, December 31, 2032, plus (2) the estimated terminal value of CommerceHub as of (a) in the case of the terminal EBITDA multiple methodology, December 31, 2022, and (b) in
the case of the perpetuity growth methodology, December 31, 2032, using both the terminal EBITDA multiple methodology and the perpetuity growth methodology. Evercore performed its
discounted cash flow analysis for CommerceHub on a standalone basis and assumed the mid-year cash flow discounting convention, with measures of unlevered free cash flow, including for
periods from January 1, 2023 - December 31, 2032, based on the Projections and the extrapolations of the Projections for fiscal years 2021 through 2022 referred to above.

        Under the terminal EBITDA multiple methodology, Evercore estimated a terminal value for CommerceHub by applying a multiple range of 15.0x to 19.0x for the projected earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense, excluding restructuring costs, of CommerceHub (adjusted EBITDA) for the one-year period ended
December 31, 2022. Evercore estimated the terminal EBITDA multiple based on the financial forecasts included in the management case forecasts, and its professional judgment given the
nature of CommerceHub and its business and industry. The cash flows and terminal value were then discounted to present value using a range of discount rates from 12.00% to 14.00%, based
on an estimate of CommerceHub's weighted average cost of capital. Evercore estimated CommerceHub's weighted average cost of capital based on application of the capital asset pricing
model and its professional judgment given the nature of CommerceHub's business and its industry. The resulting range of implied enterprise values for CommerceHub was then increased by
the amount of CommerceHub's net cash (calculated as cash and cash equivalents less debt) as of December 31, 2017, to produce a range of implied equity values for CommerceHub. Under the
terminal EBITDA multiple methodology, Evercore's discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied per share equity value for CommerceHub on a standalone basis of $19.45 to $25.21.

        Under the perpetuity growth methodology, Evercore estimated a terminal value for CommerceHub by applying a perpetuity growth rate of 2.5% to 4.5% to the estimated unlevered free
cash flow of CommerceHub for the terminal year of 2032, which assumed, among other things, projected levels of capital expenditure, changes in net working capital, and depreciation and
amortization. The cash flows and terminal value were then discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates as described above, and converted to implied equity value using
the same adjustments as described above. Under the perpetuity growth methodology, Evercore's discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied per-share equity value for CommerceHub
on a standalone basis of $13.40 to $18.62.

        Evercore compared the results of this analysis to the per-share merger consideration of $22.75.

Historical Trading Range Analysis

        Evercore reviewed, for reference and informational purposes only, historical trading prices of shares of CommerceHub Series A common stock and Series C common stock during the 52-
week period ended March 2, 2018. Evercore, in its professional judgment and given low trading volumes for the period, did not review the historical trading prices of shares of CommerceHub
Series B common stock. Evercore noted that the low and high closing prices during such period ranged from: (i) $15.01

to $23.81 per share of CommerceHub Series A common stock, and (ii) $14.90 to $22.23 per share of CommerceHub Series C common stock, as compared to the per-share merger
consideration.

General

        In connection with the review of the merger by the board, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analyses and the application of those methods to
the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without
considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore's opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore considered the results of
all the analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for purposes of its opinion. Rather, Evercore made its
determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have considered various
assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions, so that the range of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should therefore not be taken to be Evercore's
view of the value of CommerceHub. No company used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to CommerceHub, and no transaction used is directly comparable to the
merger. Further, Evercore's analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public
trading or other values of the companies or transactions used, including judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of CommerceHub or its advisors. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not equaling the total of the
figures shown.

        Evercore prepared these analyses solely for the purpose of providing an opinion to the board as to the fairness of the per-share merger consideration, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of common stock (other than the Excluded Stockholders) entitled to receive such merger consideration. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals of CommerceHub or to
necessarily reflect the prices at which CommerceHub or its securities actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. Accordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore's analyses are inherently
subject to substantial uncertainty, and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted in such estimates. The issuance of the fairness opinion
was approved by an opinion committee of Evercore.

        Evercore did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to the board or management or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration
in the merger for the holders of common stock.

Miscellaneous

        Under the terms of Evercore's engagement, Evercore has provided CommerceHub with financial advisory services and delivered a written fairness opinion to the board in connection with
the merger. Pursuant to the terms of its engagement letter, Evercore is entitled to receive (1) an opinion fee in an amount to be mutually agreed upon by CommerceHub and Evercore, which
equaled $2.0 million, regardless of the conclusion reached therein, which was earned upon delivery of its fairness opinion and which is fully creditable, to the extent previously or
contemporaneously paid, against any transaction fee payable and (2) a transaction fee, comprised of a success fee, currently estimated to total approximately $10.2 million, which Evercore will
earn subject to and upon the consummation of the merger. In addition, CommerceHub has agreed to reimburse Evercore for its expenses (including

external legal fees, expenses and disbursements) incurred in connection with its engagement and to indemnify Evercore and any of its members, partners, officers, directors, advisors,
representatives, employees, agents, affiliates or controlling persons, if any, against certain liabilities and expenses arising out of Evercore's engagement, any services performed by Evercore in
connection therewith or any transaction contemplated thereby.

        During the two-year period prior to the date of Evercore's opinion, no material relationship existed between Evercore and its affiliates and CommerceHub (other than the engagement in
connection with the merger) or Parent or any of its affiliates pursuant to which compensation was received by Evercore or its affiliates as a result of such a relationship. Taking into account the
foregoing, during the two-year period prior to the date of Evercore's opinion, Evercore and its affiliates did provide investment banking services to GTCR or one or more of its affiliated
investment funds, an affiliate of Parent, in connection with a certain unrelated acquisition transaction by GTCR, for which Evercore and its affiliates have received compensation. Evercore or
its affiliates may provide financial or other services to CommerceHub or Parent or any of its affiliates in the future, and in connection with any such services Evercore and its affiliates may
receive compensation.

        In the ordinary course of business, Evercore or its affiliates may actively trade the securities, or related derivative securities, or financial instruments of CommerceHub or its affiliates or
any of Parent's respective affiliates for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or instruments.

        The CommerceHub board engaged Evercore to act as its financial advisor based on its qualifications, experience and reputation. Evercore is an internationally recognized investment
banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, competitive biddings, private placements and valuations
for corporate and other purposes.

Projected Financial Information 

        CommerceHub does not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to future performance or earnings beyond the current fiscal year and generally does not make public projections
for extended periods due to, among other things, the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance for future periods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates
may not be realized. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, however, our management prepared the Projections and the Extended Financial Projections.
The Projections and the Extended Financial Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and, accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the
SEC or established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information or generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP). Neither our independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has compiled, examined, audited or performed any procedures with respect to the
Projections or the Extended Financial Projections or expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance regarding this information or its achievability.

        The table below presents a summary of the Projections for fiscal years 2018 through 2020, a summary of extrapolations of the Projections for fiscal years 2021 through 2022, based on
and extrapolated from such Projections, and projected unlevered free cash flow for fiscal years 2023 through 2032, all as prepared by our management and provided to our board in their
evaluation of the merger agreement, and in each case as provided to Evercore for, at our instruction, its use and reliance in connection with its financial analyses and opinion to the board as
described above under the heading "—Opinion of CommerceHub's Financial Advisor." We also provided the Projections to GTCR and Sycamore.

Table of Contents

        The table below is included solely to provide CommerceHub stockholders access to the Projections and Extended Financial Projections made available to our board, Evercore, and GTCR
and Sycamore, as applicable, in connection with their evaluation of the merger and is not included in this proxy statement to influence any stockholder's decision whether to vote for the merger
agreement or for any other purpose.

        The Projections and Extended Financial Projections, while presented with numerical specificity, were based on numerous variables and assumptions that necessarily involve judgments
with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory, and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict and many of which are beyond
our control. The Projections and Extended Financial Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. Given that the Projections and Extended
Financial Projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. Important factors that may affect actual results and the
achievability of the Projections and Extended Financial Projections include, but are not limited to, market acceptance and performance of our products and services, competitive issues, general
market conditions, regulatory matters and changes in law affecting our business, and the Risk Factors described in the 2017 Annual Report and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
and other reports we file with the SEC. See also the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" in this proxy statement.

        In addition, the Projections and Extended Financial Projections reflect assumptions that are subject to change and are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based
on actual results, revised prospects for our business, changes in general business or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not
anticipated when the Projections and Extended Financial Projections were prepared. In addition, the Projections and Extended Financial Projections may be affected by our ability to achieve
strategic goals, objectives, and targets over the applicable period. Accordingly, actual results will differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the Projections and Extended
Financial Projections. In addition, the Projections and Extended Financial Projections do not take into account any circumstances, transactions or events occurring after the date on which the
Projections and Extended Financial Projections were prepared and do not give effect to any changes or expenses as a result of the merger or any effects of the merger. There can be no
assurance that the financial results in the Projections and Extended Financial Projections will be realized, or that future actual financial results will not materially vary from those estimated in
the Projections and Extended Financial Projections.

        The Projections and Extended Financial Projections include non-GAAP measures of Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow. We report Adjusted EBITDA
in our reports filed with the SEC because management considers Adjusted EBITDA in reviewing our financial performance because we feel it is a relevant measure of the overall efficiency of
our business model. Adjusted EBITDA (as well as Adjusted Gross Profit and unlevered free cash flow, as set forth below) is not a substitute for, or superior to, and should be considered only
in addition to, net income (or the applicable comparable measure) calculated in accordance with GAAP, reports of which on a historical basis may be found in our 2017 Annual Report and
subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. In addition, our computation of the non-GAAP measures described below may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by
other companies, because all companies do not calculate these measures in the same fashion.

        The following is a summary of management's unlevered free cash flow projections for fiscal years 2023 through 2032 (dollars in millions):

        The inclusion of selected elements of the Projections and Extended Financial Projections in the table and accompanying narrative above should not be regarded as an indication that
CommerceHub and/or any of our affiliates, officers, directors, advisors (including Evercore) or other representatives consider the Projections and Extended Financial Projections to be
predictive of actual future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. None of CommerceHub and/or our affiliates, officers, directors, advisors (including Evercore) or other
representatives gives any CommerceHub stockholder or any other person any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the Projections and Extended Financial Projections
and, except as otherwise required by law, CommerceHub and/or our affiliates, officers, directors, advisors (including Evercore) or other representatives undertake no obligation to update or
otherwise revise or reconcile the Projections or Extended Financial Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date on which the Projections and Extended Financial Projections
were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions and estimates underlying the Projections and Extended Financial Projections are
shown to be in error. We have made no representation to Parent or Merger Sub concerning the Projections or Extended Financial Projections in the merger agreement or otherwise.

        In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections and Extended Financial Projections, CommerceHub stockholders and other readers of this
proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on such information.

Financing 

        General.    CommerceHub and Parent estimate that the total amount of funds required to complete the merger and related transactions and pay related fees and expenses will be
approximately $1.1 billion. Parent expects this amount to be funded through a combination of the following:

• equity financing of up to $642 million in the aggregate, consisting of up to $321 million in equity financing to be provided by investment funds affiliated with GTCR and
$321 million in equity financing to be provided by investment funds affiliated with Sycamore, or other parties to which GTCR or Sycamore assigns a portion of its
commitments; and 

• debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of $465 million, consisting of $320 million in senior secured first-lien loan facilities (consisting of a $30 million revolving
credit facility and a $290 million term loan facility) and a $145 million senior secured second-lien loan facility.

        Equity Financing.    On March 5, 2018, each of the Investors/Guarantors entered into an equity commitment letter (the equity commitment letters) with Parent pursuant to which each of
the Investors/Guarantors committed to contribute (or cause to be contributed) to Parent up to $321 million in cash, or $642 million in the aggregate, in exchange for equity securities of Parent.
The equity commitment of the Investors/Guarantors is subject to the following conditions:

• the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by CommerceHub; 

• satisfaction or waiver by Parent of the conditions precedent to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to complete the merger; 

• the concurrent funding of the debt financing; 

• the prior or concurrent funding by all other Investors/Guarantors of their commitments under the equity commitment letters; and 

• the contemporaneous consummation of the merger in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

        The obligation of each Investor/Guarantor to fund the equity commitment will automatically and immediately terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (1) the effective time (provided that
the obligation is fully discharged contemporaneously therewith); (2) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms; and (3) CommerceHub or any of its controlled
affiliates, directors or officers commencing prohibited actions or proceedings against an Investor/Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or representatives.

        CommerceHub is an express third-party beneficiary of the equity commitment letters and has the right to seek specific performance of the obligations of the Investors/Guarantors under
the equity commitment letters under certain circumstances.

        Debt Financing.    In connection with the entry into the merger agreement, Jefferies Finance LLC, Golub Capital Markets LLC, KKR Corporate Lending LLC and HPS Investment
Partners, LLC (collectively, the lenders), provided commitments to Merger Sub under a commitment letter dated March 5, 2018 (the debt commitment letter), which provides for a
commitment that adds up to the full amount of the debt financing subject to terms and express conditions. Under the debt commitment letter, the lenders have committed to provide an
aggregate principal amount of $465 million in debt financing, consisting of $320 million in senior secured first-lien loan facilities (consisting of a $30 million revolving credit facility and a
$290 million term loan facility) and a $145 million senior secured second-lien loan facility.

        The lenders' obligation to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment letter is subject to customary conditions, including the following (subject to certain exceptions and
qualifications as set forth in the debt commitment letter):

• the substantially simultaneous closing of the merger in accordance, in all material respects, with the merger agreement; 

• the substantially simultaneous funding of the equity financing; 

• the receipt of certain specified financial statements of CommerceHub; 

• the execution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the debt financing; 

• the absence of a continuing material adverse effect (as defined in the merger agreement) on CommerceHub since March 5, 2018; 

• the payment by Merger Sub of all fees and out-of-pocket expenses required pursuant to the debt commitment letter and invoiced at least three business days prior to the closing
of the merger;

• the expiration of a fifteen-day marketing period, subject to the terms of the debt commitment letter; and 

• the delivery by CommerceHub of documentation (including certain security documentation) and other information reasonably requested by the lenders.

        The commitment of the lenders under the debt commitment letter expires upon the earliest of (1) September 12, 2018, unless the merger shall not have been consummated by then, in
which case such date is automatically extended to November 26, 2018 if the outside date has been extended for a period of 75 days due to the lack of receipt of stockholder approval or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act (2) the closing date (as defined in the merger agreement), (3) the valid termination of the merger agreement
without the use of the debt financing, and (4) the completion of the merger without the use of the debt financing.

Limited Guarantees 

        Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, each of the Investors/Guarantors has executed and delivered a limited guaranty in favor of CommerceHub (collectively, the
limited guarantees), pursuant to which each Investor/Guarantor has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the limited guarantees, to guarantee, on a several basis, the payment of its
applicable percentage of Parent's obligations to pay the Parent termination fee (as described in more detail under "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees"), certain reimbursement and
indemnification obligations in connection with the debt financing, and certain collection and interest payment obligations under the merger agreement, which we refer to collectively as the
guaranteed obligations. The guaranteed obligations of each Investor/Guarantor are subject to a cap in an amount equal to $31.5 million, or $63 million in the aggregate.

        Each of the limited guarantees will terminate upon the earliest to occur of:

• the effective time; 

• the funding of the financing commitment under the equity commitment letter; 

• the payment by the Investor/Guarantor of its maximum aggregate liability, an amount not to exceed $31.5 million; and 

• the 90th day after the valid termination of the merger agreement unless, prior to the 90th day after such termination, CommerceHub shall have commenced a suit, action or other
proceeding against Parent alleging that any guaranteed obligations are due and owing to CommerceHub.

        In the event that CommerceHub or any of its controlled affiliates, directors or officers asserts in any litigation or other legal proceeding relating to a limited guarantee that certain
provisions of the limited guarantee are illegal, invalid, or unenforceable or that the Investor/Guarantor is liable in excess of the cap or any claim other than certain specified permitted claims,
then (1) the obligations of such Investor/Guarantor under such limited guarantee will terminate, (2) if such Investor/Guarantor has previously made any payments under its limited guarantee, it
will be entitled to recover such payments from CommerceHub and (3) the Investor/Guarantor will not have any liability to CommerceHub with respect to the merger agreement or such limited
guarantee.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger 

        General.    In considering the recommendation of our board that you vote to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that, aside from their interests as stockholders of
CommerceHub, CommerceHub's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of other stockholders of CommerceHub generally.
Members of our board were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger

agreement and the merger, and in recommending to CommerceHub stockholders that the merger agreement be adopted. See the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Reasons for the
Merger." CommerceHub stockholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. These interests are described in
more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the narrative and the tables below.

        CommerceHub Executive Officers.    CommerceHub's current executive officers for purposes of the discussion below are: Francis Poore, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer;
Richard Jones, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer; John Hinkle, Chief Information Officer, Chief Information Security Officer and Executive Vice President, Technical Operations;
Michael Trimarchi, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Commercial Officer; and Douglas Wolfson, General Counsel and Secretary. Messrs. Poore and Jones were named executive officers in
CommerceHub's proxy statement for its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders and Mr. Trimarchi is the current principal financial officer (collectively with Messrs. Poore and Jones, the
NEOs). Mark Greenquist, also a named executive officer in CommerceHub's proxy statement for its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, resigned from the role of Chief Financial Officer and
Treasurer effective December 14, 2017, and terminated employment with CommerceHub effective December 31, 2017. In connection with his termination, Mr. Greenquist's then-existing
equity awards and other benefits were treated in accordance with the provisions of his separation agreement with CommerceHub, and he will not receive any severance or enhanced benefits as
an executive in connection with the merger. As a result, unless specifically noted, Mr. Greenquist has been omitted from the discussion and tables below.

        Assumptions.    The potential payments in the narrative and tables below are, unless otherwise noted, based on the following assumptions:

• the relevant price per share of common stock is $22.75 per share, which is the merger consideration per share; 

• the effective time of the merger is April 13, 2018, which is the latest practicable closing date prior to the filing of this document with the SEC; 

• no CommerceHub stock options are exercised between the date of this proxy statement and the closing of the merger; and 

• the NEOs are terminated without "cause" or resign for "good reason," in either case immediately following the assumed effective time of the merger on April 13, 2018.

        The amounts set forth in the narrative and tables below are estimates of amounts that would be payable to the CommerceHub executive officers based on multiple assumptions that may or
may not actually occur, including the assumptions described above. Some of the assumptions are based on information not currently available and, as a result, the actual amounts received by a
CommerceHub executive officer may differ materially from the amounts shown in the following table. In particular, no CommerceHub executive officer is expected to experience a qualifying
termination in connection with the merger.

        Equity-Based Awards.    As of the effective time, all vested and unvested equity awards held by our executive officers and directors, other than the 2018 employee RSU awards, will be
accelerated, as applicable, and cashed out as described under "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Company Equity Awards." The employee 2018 RSU awards will be treated as described
under "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Company Equity Awards" and the portion of each award that continues following the closing of the merger as a cash award will vest pursuant to
the terms of the 2018 employee RSU award agreement if, within the 24-month period following the effective time, the executive officer's employment is terminated by the Surviving
Corporation without cause (as such term is defined in the applicable 2018 employee RSU award agreement) or pursuant to a voluntary

termination for good reason (as such term is defined in the applicable 2018 employee RSU award agreement). The estimated value of the accelerated vesting of equity awards held by the
NEOs is quantified in the table below under "Merger Related Compensation for Named Executive Officers". The estimated value of the benefits that CommerceHub's executive officers (other
than the NEOs) and non-employee directors would receive in respect of their stock options and restricted stock unit awards (including deferred stock units) in connection with the merger is
$9,144,498.

        2018 Bonus Payments.    If following the merger any executive officer (other than Mr. Poore) is terminated without cause prior to the payment date of 2018 bonuses, such executive
officer will remain eligible for a 2018 bonus payment, calculated and paid as if such executive officer had remained employed through the payment date of such bonus, provided that the
amount of such payment shall be (i) calculated without discretionary adjustment for individual performance and (ii) prorated for such executive officer's period of employment during 2018.
For 2018, the target bonus opportunity for Messrs. Jones and Trimarchi are $150,000 and $292,000, respectively.

        Employment Agreements.    Mr. Poore's employment agreement provides for a four-year employment term ending on June 27, 2020 (the CEO employment period). If, during the CEO
employment period, Mr. Poore is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (as defined in the agreement), he is entitled to: (i) any accrued compensation, (ii) a salary continuation
severance payment equal to two times his annual base salary, to be paid in equal installments over a 24 month period, (iii) an additional lump sum severance payment equal to a pro rata portion
of his annual base salary based on the number of days he was employed during the year of termination (the additional payment), (iv) any annual cash bonus that has been declared as of the
date of the termination with respect to the prior calendar year and which has not yet been paid (unpaid bonus), (v) if he elects continued coverage under our medical plan(s), the applicable
premium required for COBRA continuation coverage for Mr. Poore and his spouse and eligible dependents (as applicable), until the earlier of the date he receives equivalent coverage from a
successor employer and the first anniversary of the date of termination, and (vi) continued participation in any life insurance plan (if permitted under such plan) until the earlier of the date he
receives equivalent coverage from a successor employer and the first anniversary of the date of termination. Mr. Poore's receipt and retention of severance benefits (aside from the accrued
compensation) is also conditioned on his compliance with the post-termination non-compete, non-disclosure and non-interference restrictions in his employment agreement, which generally
continue for two years following a termination of his employment. CommerceHub has also agreed to reimburse certain legal fees incurred by Mr. Poore in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Mr. Jones' employment agreement provides that if Mr. Jones is terminated without cause or experiences a constructive termination without cause (as defined in the agreement), he is
entitled to any accrued compensation and a lump sum severance payment equal to the net present value, discounted using the applicable federal rate for short-term obligations for the month in
which the termination occurs, of one year's salary as in effect at the time of his termination. As a condition to Mr. Jones' receipt of the lump sum severance payment, he must execute a general
release in accordance with the procedures set forth in his employment agreement. Mr. Jones' receipt and retention of severance benefits (aside from the accrued compensation) is also
conditioned on his compliance with the post-termination non-compete, non-disclosure and non-interference restrictions in his employment agreement, which generally continue for one year
following a termination of his employment.

        Mr. Trimarchi's offer letter provides that if his employment is terminated other than for cause (as defined in his offer letter) during the six-month period following the consummation of a
change in control (as defined in his offer letter) resulting from a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's business to a third-party acquirer, other than an exempt holder (as defined in his
offer letter), the Company will pay Mr. Trimarchi a lump-sum severance amount equal to the net present value of his

then-current annual base salary in effect as of the date of termination, subject to Mr. Trimarchi executing a general release in accordance with his offer letter.

        Indemnification and Insurance.    Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, directors and executive officers of CommerceHub will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and
coverage under directors' and officers' liability insurance policies following the merger. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled "The Merger
Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreement—Indemnification and Directors' and Officers' Insurance."

        Director Deferred Compensation Plan.    Pursuant to the terms of the Company's Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan, amounts deferred by directors under such plan
will be accelerated and paid in connection with the merger. These amounts were previously earned and vested but payment was deferred pursuant to the director's election until a specified date
or the director's termination of service. Amounts are deferred in the form of deferred stock units (DSUs) and in connection with the merger each DSU will be converted into a right to receive
$22.75. The estimated payout pursuant to this acceleration for each nonemployee director who participates in the plan is set forth in the table below.

        In addition, as described above under "—Equity-Based Awards," (i) any outstanding director restricted stock unit awards will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive $22.75
in cash per share at the effective time and (ii) in June 2018, at the customary time as of which annual equity awards would be made to nonemployee directors (or, if earlier, immediately prior to
the effective time), CommerceHub expects each nonemployee director to receive restricted stock units valued at $150,000 as of the date of grant, which restricted stock units will be converted
into the right to receive $22.75 in cash as of the effective time.

        Merger-Related Compensation for Named Executive Officers.    The table below sets forth for each of the NEOs estimates of the amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise
relate to the merger. Certain amounts will or may become payable on a qualifying termination of employment following the merger (i.e., on a "double-trigger" basis). Certain other benefits will
become payable upon the occurrence of the closing of the merger (i.e., on a "single-trigger" basis).

        The amounts shown are, unless otherwise noted, calculated based on the assumptions described under "Assumptions" above and noted in the footnotes below, which may or may not
actually occur. Some of the assumptions are based on information not currently available and, as a result, the actual amounts received by each NEO may differ materially from the amounts
shown in the following table.

(1) Messrs. Baer, Cattini and Huseby have previously elected to defer upcoming quarterly fees pursuant to the Non-Employee Director Deferred
Compensation Plan, and thus each of their account balances will be increased by the quarterly fees otherwise payable in cash during each quarter that ends
prior to the completion of the merger.

Richard Jones  $ 339,072 $ 5,339,897 $ 3,267,850  —  — $ 8,946,819 

(1) The cash payments represent double-trigger payments for severance under the applicable employment agreement or offer letter and the pro-rata annual bonus for
2018. The severance payment to be made to Mr. Poore in connection with a termination without cause or by Mr. Poore for good reason prior to June 27, 2020 would
be a cash payment equal to (i) two times his annual base salary, payable in equal installments over a 24-month period following termination, plus (ii) a pro rata
portion of Mr. Poore's annual base salary based on the number of days he was employed during the year of termination, payable in a lump sum. The severance
payment to be made to Mr. Jones in connection with a termination without cause or a constructive termination without cause prior to January 20, 2021 would be a
lump sum cash payment equal to the net present value, discounted using the applicable federal rate for short-term obligations for the month in which the termination
occurs, of one year's base salary as in effect at the time of his termination. The severance payment to be made to Mr. Trimarchi in connection with a termination
other than for cause within the six-month period following the effective time is a lump sum payment equal to the net present value, discounted using the applicable
federal rate for short-term obligations for the month in which the termination occurs, of one year's base salary as in effect at the time of his termination. 

(2) This single trigger payment represents the value of all vested stock options that will convert into a right to receive $22.75 less the per-share exercise price of the
option as of the effective time pursuant to the merger agreement. 

(3) This single trigger payment represents the value of all unvested stock options that will vest and convert into a right to receive $22.75 less the per-share exercise price
of the option and, with respect to Mr. Trimarchi, his accelerated RSU awards and 25% of his 2018 employee RSU award which will vest and convert into a right to
receive $22.75 per each vested RSU, in each case, as of the effective time pursuant to the merger agreement. For Mr. Poore, until the effective time occurs, an
additional 48,045 options vest each month under the original terms of the option grant based on his continued employment. For Mr. Jones, if the effective time has
not occurred as of July 20, 2018, an additional 144,197 options will vest under the original terms of the option grant assuming continued employment until such
date. Neither Mr. Poore nor Mr. Jones has any outstanding equity awards other than stock options. 

(4) This double trigger payment represents the value equal to 75% of Mr. Trimarchi's 2018 employee RSU award which will not vest automatically as of the effective
time, but will be converted into a cash award that will vest in the event that Mr. Trimarchi's employment is terminated without cause or pursuant to a voluntary
termination for good reason within the 24-month period following the effective time. 

(5) This double trigger payment represents the value of medical plan premiums required for COBRA continuation coverage for Mr. Poore and his spouse and eligible
dependents (as applicable), and continued participation in any life insurance plan, in each case for one year following termination.

        CEO Co-Investment.    On March 5, 2018, Mr. Poore, our President and Chief Executive Officer, entered into a co-investor agreement (the co-investor agreement) with Great Dane
Holding, an affiliate of Parent, pursuant to which he committed to, at the closing, invest $6 million of the post-tax proceeds from the merger consideration he receives for his existing stock
options in the preferred and common equity securities of Great Dane Holding. His investment will be pari-passu with the Investor/Guarantor investments.

        In connection with the co-investor agreement, Mr. Poore and Great Dane Holding agreed to enter into a senior management agreement, a security holders agreement and a registration
agreement containing provisions regarding, among other things, Mr. Poore's service as Chief Executive Officer and on the board of directors, management incentive programs, Mr. Poore's base
salary (which will be no less than his current base salary), bonus target (which will be no less than 100% of his base salary at the start of each fiscal year) and severance benefits (which will be
consistent with his current severance benefits) and certain transfer rights and obligations concerning Mr. Poore's equity. Mr. Poore and Great Dane Holding further agreed that Great Dane
Holding would establish a management carry pool at the closing (the "management carry pool"), with vesting of the management carry pool to occur on both a time-basis and on a
performance basis based on Investor/Guarantor returns. Mr. Poore will receive units in the management carry pool representing 5% of the common equity of Great Dane Holding, with 60% of
the units subject to vesting on a time-basis and 40% of the units subject to vesting on a performance basis based on Investor/Guarantor returns. Great Dane Holding and Mr. Poore will also
determine other members of management that are eligible to participate in the management carry pool.

        Arrangements with Parent.    Other than the Mr. Poore's arrangements in connection with the co-investor agreement (including the right of Mr. Poore to designate, jointly with the
Investor/Guarantors, participants in the management carry pool), as of the date of this proxy statement, none of our executive officers has entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its
affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates. Prior to or following the closing of the
merger, however, some or all of our executive officers or other employees may further discuss or enter into agreements with Parent or any of its affiliates regarding employment with, or the
right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of common stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger.
This discussion is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), applicable U.S. Treasury regulations (Treasury Regulations), judicial authorities,
and administrative interpretations, each as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement. These authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could
affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. We cannot assure you that the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) will not challenge one or more of the tax
consequences described in this discussion or that a court would not sustain such challenge.

        This discussion applies only to holders of shares of common stock who hold such shares as a "capital asset" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for
investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder's particular circumstances,
or that may apply to a holder that is subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, insurance companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign
currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, cooperatives,
banks and certain other financial

Table of Contents

institutions, mutual funds, certain expatriates, partnerships, S corporations, or other pass-through entities or investors in partnerships or such other entities, holders who hold shares of common
stock as part of a straddle, constructive sale, or conversion transaction, holders who will hold, directly or indirectly, an equity interest in the surviving corporation, and holders who acquired
their shares of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements). Moreover, this discussion does not address the tax consequences of the
merger arising under any applicable state, local, or foreign tax laws or the application of other U.S. federal taxes, such as the federal estate tax, the federal gift tax, the "Medicare" tax on
certain net investment income, or the alternative minimum tax.

        If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of common stock, the tax treatment of a
partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partners and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding shares of common stock, you
should consult your tax advisor.

        For purposes of this discussion, the term U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• a citizen or individual resident of the United States; 

• a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or
the District of Columbia; 

• a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all
substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or 

• an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

        For purposes of this discussion, a non-U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of common stock, other than a partnership or other entity taxable as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, that is not a U.S. Holder.

        Holders of common stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the U.S. federal tax laws to their particular situation and the applicability and effect of
state, local or foreign tax laws and tax treaties.

        Consequences to U.S. Holders.    The receipt of cash by U.S. Holders in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if
any, between (1) the amount of cash received and (2) the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares of common stock.

        Any such gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder upon the exchange of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital
gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period in its shares of common stock is more than one year on the closing date of the merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders
generally are eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of common stock at
different times and different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of common stock.

Table of Contents

        Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.    Subject to the discussion below in "—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding," a non-U.S. Holder who receives cash in exchange for its
shares of common stock in the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on such exchange unless:

• such gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. Holder's conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable treaty, is attributable to a permanent
establishment or fixed base maintained by the non-U.S. Holder in the United States); 

• the non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year in which the merger occurs and certain other conditions are
satisfied; or 

• the non-U.S. Holder's common stock constitutes a "United States real property interest" as defined in the Code (a USRPI).

        A non-U.S. Holder described in the first bullet above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the same manner as a U.S. Holder with respect to the receipt of cash in
exchange for common stock in the merger. A non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation may also be subject to an additional "branch profits tax" at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be
specified by an applicable treaty) on its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments.

        Gain recognized with respect to shares of common stock surrendered in the merger by a non-U.S. Holder who is described in the second bullet above generally will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty) but may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses, if any, of the non-U.S. Holder.

        With respect to the third bullet above, the non-U.S. Holder's common stock will not be treated as a USRPI unless CommerceHub is or has been a "United States real property holding
corporation," as defined in the Code (a USRPHC), at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the merger or the non-U.S. Holder's holding period, whichever period is
shorter. CommerceHub does not believe that it has been or will become a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the merger. Further, even if contrary to our
expectation, CommerceHub were treated as a USRPHC at any time during the applicable period, the non-U.S. Holder's common stock will not be treated as a USRPI unless (1) such series of
common stock exchanged in the merger was not regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 1.897-9T(d) of the Treasury Regulations) prior to the
merger, or (2) such holder owned, actually or constructively, more than five percent of such series of common stock during the applicable period described above. If a non-U.S. Holder's
common stock constitutes a USRPI, such non-U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain recognized in the merger on a net basis in the same manner as a U.S. Holder.

        Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.    Payments made in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject, under certain circumstances, to
information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%). To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. Holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and
return IRS Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. Holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided is correct, and such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding. In
general, a non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to cash payments to the non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger if the non-U.S. Holder has provided an IRS
Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or an IRS Form W-8ECI if the non-U.S. Holder's gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business).

        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if
any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.

Table of Contents

        This summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice. Holders of common stock should consult
their own tax advisors regarding the application of the U.S. federal tax laws to their particular situation and the applicability and effect of state, local or foreign tax laws and tax
treaties.

Regulatory Approvals 

        Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until notifications have been given and information furnished to the antitrust
division and the FTC and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. On March 26, 2018, both CommerceHub and Parent filed their respective Notification and Report
Forms with the antitrust division and the FTC. On April 6, 2018, the FTC granted early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the merger. With such early
termination, the condition to the merger relating to the expiration or termination of the HSR Act waiting period has been satisified.

        At any time before or after the effective time, the antitrust division or the FTC could take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to prevent the merger, to rescind the merger or
to conditionally approve the merger upon the divestiture of assets of CommerceHub or Parent or subject to regulatory conditions or other remedies. In addition, U.S. state attorneys general
could take action under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or permitting
completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to
the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this
proxy statement. This summary may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the merger agreement in its
entirety, as the rights and obligations of the parties thereto are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this
proxy statement.

        The merger agreement and the below description have been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding the terms of the merger agreement. They are not
intended to provide any other factual information about Parent, Merger Sub, CommerceHub, or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or equityholders. The representations, warranties and
covenants contained in the merger agreement were made only for purposes of those agreements and as of specific dates; were solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement; and
may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made by each contracting party to the other for the purposes of allocating
contractual risk between them that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors should be aware that the representations, warranties and covenants or any description thereof may not
reflect the actual state of facts or condition of Parent, Merger Sub, CommerceHub or any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, businesses, or equityholders. Moreover, information
concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully
reflected in public disclosures by CommerceHub.

The Merger 

        The merger agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with Delaware law, at the effective time, Merger Sub will be merged
with and into CommerceHub and, as a result of the merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and CommerceHub will continue as the Surviving Corporation and
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. As the Surviving Corporation, the separate corporate existence of CommerceHub, and all of its property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
and franchises, will continue unaffected by the merger.

        Unless the merger agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms, the closing of the merger will occur no later than the second business day after all of the conditions set forth in the
merger agreement and described below under "—Conditions to the Merger" are satisfied or waived, to the extent permitted under the merger agreement, or at such other time and on a date as
agreed to by the parties in writing. In addition, the closing shall not occur prior to the third business day following the termination of the marketing period set forth in the merger agreement and
related to the debt financing to be obtained in connection with the merger (the marketing period).

        The merger will become effective when the certificate of merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at a later date and time as the parties may agree upon and set
forth in the certificate of merger. The merger is currently expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018. However, the parties cannot predict the exact timing of the completion of the
merger or whether the merger will be completed at an earlier or later time, as agreed by the parties, or at all.

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock 

        Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of our Series A common stock, Series B common stock and Series C common stock outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time, other than shares owned by CommerceHub or any of its subsidiaries (including those held in CommerceHub's treasury), owned by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries (including Merger Sub)

and any dissenting shares, will be converted automatically into the right to receive $22.75 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

        At the effective time, each share of common stock that is owned by CommerceHub or any of its subsidiaries (including those held in CommerceHub's treasury) or owned by Parent or any
of its subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled and will cease to exist and no consideration will be delivered in exchange for such share.

        At the effective time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub held by Parent immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $0.01 per share, and will constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards 

        CommerceHub Stock Options.    As of the effective time, each CommerceHub stock option, whether or not vested and exercisable, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the effective time will be automatically cancelled and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the total number of shares of common stock
that were issuable upon exercise or settlement of such CommerceHub stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (2) the excess, if any, of $22.75 over the per-share exercise price
of such CommerceHub stock option, less any applicable tax withholding.

        Restricted Stock.    As of the effective time, each outstanding share of CommerceHub restricted stock, whether or not vested, shall be cancelled and the holder shall instead be entitled to
receive an amount in cash equal to $22.75, less any applicable tax withholding.

        Restricted Stock Unit Awards.    As of the effective time, each accelerated RSU award, whether or not vested, will be automatically cancelled and the holder shall instead be entitled to
receive an amount in cash equal to (1) $22.75 multiplied by (2) the number of shares of common stock subject to such accelerated RSU award, less any applicable tax withholding. As of the
effective time, each 2018 employee RSU award will vest with respect to 25% of the restricted stock units subject to such 2018 employee RSU award, with such vested restricted stock units
treated in the same manner as the accelerated RSU awards. Each restricted stock unit granted pursuant to a 2018 employee RSU award that does not vest as of the effective time shall be
cancelled and converted into a right to receive $22.75 in cash. The cash award will vest in 25% installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date of the applicable 2018
employee RSU award, subject to the holder's continued employment through each vesting date. Upon vesting, the cash award will be settled in cash in accordance with the Surviving
Corporation's then-current payroll practices. If, within the 24-month period following the effective time, the holder's employment is terminated by the Surviving Corporation without cause (as
such term is defined in the applicable 2018 employee RSU award agreement) or pursuant to a voluntary termination for good reason (as such term is defined in the applicable 2018 employee
RSU award agreement), the cash award will vest and be payable as of such termination date.

Treatment of CommerceHub's ESPP 

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, the offering period under the ESPP that began on January 1, 2018 ended on March 26, 2018, and the ESPP was terminated as of such date. Any
employee contributions collected were applied towards the purchase of shares pursuant to the terms of the ESPP.

Payment for the Common Stock and Equity Awards in the Merger 

        At or prior to the effective time, Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited with the exchange agent sufficient cash to pay to the holders of the common stock the merger consideration of
$22.75 per

share. Promptly after the effective time, Parent will cause the exchange agent to send to each record holder of shares of common stock that were converted into the merger consideration a letter
of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the delivery of shares to the exchange agent and for effecting the surrender of certificates in exchange for the merger consideration. Each
holder of our common stock that has been converted into the right to receive the merger consideration will be entitled to receive such merger consideration upon (i) surrender to the exchange
agent of a certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the exchange agent (or such other evidence, if any, that the exchange
agent may reasonably request) in the case of book-entry shares of our common stock. Until so surrendered, each certificate and book entry share representing such shares of common stock will
represent, after the effective time, only the right to receive such merger consideration.

        The Surviving Corporation will pay to each holder of Company equity awards, the cash amounts described above under "—Treatment of Company Equity Awards" at the effective time or
as soon as practicable thereafter (but not later than the later of seven business days after the effective time and the Company's first regularly scheduled payroll date following the effective time.

Representations and Warranties 

        The merger agreement contains representations and warranties that: (1) were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were solely for the benefit of the
parties to the merger agreement; (3) may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purpose of allocating
contractual risk between the parties to the merger agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts; and (4) may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the parties that differ
from those applicable to investors. CommerceHub stockholders and other investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the representations and
warranties or any description of such representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of CommerceHub or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or
may not be fully reflected in public disclosures by CommerceHub.

        Representations of Both Parties.    The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of each of CommerceHub and of Parent and Merger Sub relating to, among other things:

        Definition of Material Adverse Effect.    Some of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are subject to materiality or Company material adverse effect or Parent
material adverse effect qualifications (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct would, as the case may be, be material or have a material
adverse effect on CommerceHub or Parent).

        For purposes of the merger agreement, a Company material adverse effect on CommerceHub means any event, occurrence, fact, condition, change, development or effect that,
individually or in the

aggregate has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (A) the business, assets, properties, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of CommerceHub
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) the ability of CommerceHub to perform its obligations under the merger agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. However, subject to certain exceptions, the Company material adverse effect standard excludes, in the case of clause (A) above, any such Company material adverse effect resulting
from or arising out of:

• any change in general economic or regulatory conditions, including changes in financial or credit markets; 

• any change in general political or geopolitical conditions; 

• any fluctuations or conditions in financial or security markets; 

• any general change or events generally affecting the industries in which CommerceHub or any of its subsidiaries operate; 

• any change or proposed change in GAAP or in applicable laws (or the enforcement or interpretation thereof); 

• the execution of the merger agreement, the identity of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors or their affiliates as direct or indirect acquirers, or any facts or circumstances relating
to the identity of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors or their respective affiliates; 

• any specific actions taken by CommerceHub as required or expressly contemplated by the merger agreement; 

• any specific actions taken by CommerceHub with the express prior written consent of Parent; 

• any specific actions omitted to be taken by CommerceHub that are expressly prohibited by the merger agreement if CommerceHub has requested the consent of Parent and
Parent has unreasonably withheld its consent; 

• any changes in the price or trading volume of CommerceHub's common stock; 

• any failure by CommerceHub to meet published or unpublished plans, forecasts, projections, estimates or predictions in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial or
operating metrics; 

• the availability or cost of financing, whether debt, equity, or otherwise, to Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors; or 

• the any changes or events arising out of or resulting from any stockholder litigation;

        provided that, with respect to the first, second, third, fourth and fifth bullets above, any such event, occurrence, fact, condition, change, development or effect to the extent it
disproportionately affects CommerceHub and its subsidiaries relative to other participants in the industries in which CommerceHub or its subsidiaries operate may be taken into account in
determining whether or not a material adverse effect has occurred.

        For the purpose of the merger agreement, a Parent material adverse effect means any event, occurrence, fact, condition, change, development or effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, would be reasonably expected to prevent or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including
the merger, on or prior to the outside date (subject to any applicable extensions).

alternative transaction proposal; 

• enter into, engage, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an alternative transaction proposal or grant access to or furnish to any person

that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law, CommerceHub may then take the following actions:

• furnish any nonpublic information to, the person or group making such alternative transaction proposal and afford access to the business, properties, assets, books and records of
CommerceHub and its subsidiaries, provided that (i) prior to furnishing any such information, CommerceHub receives from such person or group an executed confidentiality
agreement containing confidentiality terms at least as restrictive and at least as favorable to CommerceHub as the terms contained in the confidentiality agreement with Parent
and Merger Sub, (other than de minimis differences) and that does not prohibit or conflict with any obligation in the merger agreement and (ii) CommerceHub (A) will not, and
will not permit its subsidiaries to, furnish any nonpublic information to any person or group who has made, or which would reasonably be expected to make, an alternative
transaction proposal except pursuant to such confidentiality agreement, and (B) will not, and shall cause its subsidiaries to not, provide any commercially sensitive nonpublic
information to any competitor except in a manner consistent with CommerceHub's past practices in dealing with the disclosure of such information in the context of considering
alternative transaction proposals prior to the date of the merger agreement; and 

• engage in discussions or negotiations with such person or group with respect to such alternative transaction proposal.

        Superior proposal means a bona fide written alternative transaction proposal (substituting 662/3% for each reference to 20% in the definition of alternative transaction proposal) that our
board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisor and taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory, timing, financing and other conditions
and aspects of such alternative transaction proposal and the person making such alternative transaction proposal:

• is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed; 

• to the extent financing is required, such financing is then fully committed or reasonably capable of being obtained prior to the consummation of the transaction; 

• if consummated, would result in a transaction which is more favorable from a financial point of view to CommerceHub stockholders than the terms of the merger agreement and
the other transactions contemplated thereby; and 

• is otherwise on terms that our board has determined to be superior to the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.

        Following the date of the merger agreement, CommerceHub shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) following CommerceHub's receipt of any alternative
transaction proposal or any proposal, offer or credible inquiry with respect to, or which could reasonably likely lead to, any alternative transaction proposal or any requests for nonpublic
information, or any discussions or negotiations being sought to be initiated or continued with, CommerceHub, any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or representatives, provide Parent with written notice of such alternative transaction proposal or inquiry, which notice shall include a written summary of the material terms and
conditions thereof and copies of any proposed material written agreements or material correspondence exchanged. In addition, CommerceHub shall provide Parent as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within 24 hours) with (A) all information, material developments, discussions or negotiations, in each case, as reasonably necessary to keep Parent reasonably currently
informed of all written or material oral communications regarding, and the status of any material developments regarding, any such alternative transaction proposal or inquiry and (B) all
material nonpublic information concerning CommerceHub or its subsidiaries provided to the person making such alternative transaction proposal or inquiry which was not previously provided
to Parent.

subsidiaries, taken as a whole (such material fact, event, change, development or circumstance, an intervening event) or (y) a superior proposal, our board may make a company adverse
recommendation change if our board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law and (B) solely in the case of a superior proposal, our board may terminate the merger agreement and enter into a superior
proposal if, for either clause (A) or (B):

• in the case of a superior proposal, such superior proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a superior proposal, and did not, directly or indirectly,
result from or arise out of a breach of CommerceHub's non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement; 

• the CommerceHub stockholder approval has not been obtained; 

• our board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such intervening event or superior proposal, as
applicable, the failure to make a Company adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement and enter into a superior proposal, would reasonably be likely to
violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law; 

• CommerceHub has 

• provided Parent at least four business days' prior written notice (the notice period) stating (x) that CommerceHub has received a superior proposal or there has been an
intervening event, (y) the material terms of the superior proposal and a copy of all relevant transaction

make a Company adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement and enter a superior proposal, as applicable;

recommendation and not make a Company adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement during the notice period; 

• considered in good faith any bona fide offer made by Parent to CommerceHub during the notice period; and 

• following the expiration of the notice period and any negotiations with or consideration of any bona fide offers by Parent during the notice period, our board once again
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such intervening event or superior proposal, as
applicable, the failure to make a Company adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement and enter into a superior proposal, would reasonably be
likely to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        None of CommerceHub, our board or any committee thereof shall enter into any agreement with any person to limit or not to give prior notice to Parent of its intention to effect a
Company adverse recommendation change or to terminate the merger agreement in light of a superior proposal.

        The merger agreement provides that none of its terms will be deemed to prohibit CommerceHub from taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) of
the Exchange Act, or making any disclosure that constitutes a "stop, look and listen" communication as contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act.

        The merger agreement includes an agreement by CommerceHub to not release or permit the release of any person from, or to waive or permit the waiver or termination of any provision
of, any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which any of CommerceHub or any subsidiary is a party or any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price," "interested
stockholder," "affiliate transaction," "business combination," or other antitakeover law, and to use its reasonable best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by
law each such agreement.

        SEC Documents and Special Meeting.    Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and in accordance with applicable law and CommerceHub's governing documents, CommerceHub
agreed to duly give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of considering and taking action upon the adoption of the merger agreement. Unless our
board effects a Company adverse recommendation change, our board shall make the recommendation that CommerceHub stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.

        Access to Information.    From the date of the merger agreement until the effective time, upon reasonable notice, CommerceHub will use reasonable best efforts to afford Parent and its
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities, books and records of each of CommerceHub and its
subsidiaries, and all other financial, operating and other data and information as shall be reasonably requested and furnish a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received
pursuant to the requirements of the federal securities laws or a governmental authority, subject to certain exceptions.

        Efforts to Complete the Merger; Governmental Approvals.    CommerceHub and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or

make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Each of CommerceHub and Parent (and their
respective affiliates, if applicable) will:

• as soon as practicable, prepare and file all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the
taking of such actions reasonably necessary to obtain any requisite approvals, consents, orders, exemptions or waivers by any governmental authority or other third party,
including filings pursuant to the HSR Act or as required by any other governmental authority relating to antitrust, competition, trade, pre-merger notification or other regulatory
matters; 

• obtain all necessary consents, approvals, authorizations or waivers from, and provide notices to, third parties, including providing any further information as may be required by
such third party; 

• defend any actions challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger, including seeking to have vacated or reversed any order that would restrain, prevent
or delay the closing of the merger agreement; and 

• execute and deliver any additional instruments required by applicable law necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to fully carry
out the purposes of the merger agreement.

        Each of CommerceHub and Parent agree to take certain steps to cooperate with respect to obtaining governmental approvals. In addition, if any objections are asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement under any domestic or foreign antitrust or competition law or if any legal action or proceeding is instituted or threatened by the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other applicable governmental authority challenging any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or which would
otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, Parent shall take all reasonable actions necessary to resolve any
such objections or actions or threatened Actions so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to close as soon as reasonably practicable.

        Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance.    The merger agreement provides that, for six years after the effective time, Parent shall maintain in effect provisions in the
Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of directors and officers and advancement of fees, costs and
expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in CommerceHub's charter and bylaws. From and after the effective time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, to honor and comply with their respective obligations under any indemnification agreement with any present and former
directors and officers of the CommerceHub and its subsidiaries (each, an indemnified person), and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such agreement in any manner that would
materially adversely affect any indemnification right of any indemnified person thereunder.

        The merger agreement further provides that, as of the effective time, Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the
directors' and officers' liability coverage of CommerceHub's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and CommerceHub's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, which shall
(i) be for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the effective time, (ii) be from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as CommerceHub's
current insurance carrier and (iii) have terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under CommerceHub's existing policies with
respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against an indemnified person by reason of his or her
having served in such capacity at or prior to the effective

time (including in connection with the merger agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated by the merger agreement). If the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the effective time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect or purchase, for a period of at least six years from and after the effective time,
the director's and officer's insurance plan in place with the CommerceHub's current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under CommerceHub's existing policies. Parent or the Surviving Corporation are not, however, required to
pay an annual premium for such policies in excess of 300% of the premium amount per annum for CommerceHub's existing policies, and if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the effective time, for a cost
not exceeding such amount.

        Employee Matters.    For a period of one year following the closing date of the merger, the employees of CommerceHub and its subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the merger who
remain employed by the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries immediately following the merger will receive (i) an annual base salary or wages, as applicable, that are substantially
similar in the aggregate to that provided to such employee as of immediately prior to the effective time, and (ii) employee benefits and other cash compensation (other than any equity or
equity-based, defined benefit pension, and nonqualified deferred compensation benefits) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to that provided to such employee as of immediately
prior to the effective time. For a period of one year following the closing date of the merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will maintain a severance pay practice for the benefit of each
employee that is substantially similar in the aggregate to the severance pay practice in effect and applicable to such employee immediately prior to the closing date of the merger. With respect
to health and welfare plans, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive preexisting conditions and other limitations with respect to
coverage of the employees of CommerceHub and its subsidiaries (as long as they are employed immediately prior to the effective time) and (ii) provide credit for any co-payments, deductibles
or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees of CommerceHub and its subsidiaries during the calendar year of the effective time. Additionally, Parent will recognize the service each
employee with CommerceHub and its subsidiaries as service with Parent or its affiliates in connection with any employee benefit plans (including 401(k) plans, vacation, sick leave and
holiday policies) maintained by Parent and its affiliates which is made available following the merger by Parent and its affiliates for purposes of any waiting period, vesting and eligibility to
the extent such service was credited for the same purpose under the corresponding Company Plan prior to closing; provided, however, that no such service shall be credited to the extent that
doing so would result in the duplication of benefits or for the purpose of benefit accruals under any defined benefit plan. Nothing in the merger agreement limits Parent's right to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any specific employee benefit plan that Parent would otherwise have under the terms of such plan, or will give any individual a right to continued employment
following the effective time.

        Debt Financing.    Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to arrange, consummate and obtain the financing on conditions no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the conditions described in the commitment letters, including to:

• maintain in effect the commitment letters; 

• satisfy on a timely basis all conditions that are in the control of Parent and its subsidiaries in the commitment letters or obtain a waiver of such conditions, and comply in all
material respects with its obligations in the commitment letters; and 

• diligently and in good faith enforce its rights under the commitment letters.

        Financing Cooperation.    CommerceHub shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause each of its subsidiaries and their representatives to use their respective reasonable
best efforts to provide, to Parent, at Parent's sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent, Merger Sub, its representative or financing sources to assist them in arranging and
obtaining debt financing subject to certain exceptions as detailed in the merger agreement.

• Parent or Merger Sub's breach of its representations or warranties or failure to perform any covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement which would result in
the failure to satisfy a closing condition and such breach has not been timely cured; or 

• the merger not being completed within three business days following the date the closing should have occurred pursuant to the merger agreement, and at the time of such
termination, all conditions to Parent's obligation to consummate the closing (other than those conditions that are to be satisfied by action taken at the closing) have been satisfied
and CommerceHub is ready, willing, and able to complete the merger on such date.

Table of Contents

        Each of the parties acknowledges that any amount payable by CommerceHub or Parent including any termination fee does not constitute a penalty, but rather shall constitute liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate a party for the disposition of its rights under the merger agreement in the circumstances in which such amounts are due and payable,
which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

Reimbursement of Expenses 

        Each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        If the merger agreement is terminated by Parent after our board or a committee thereof effects a Company adverse recommendation change (or such change otherwise occurs), whether or
not permitted in the merger agreement, following the special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, in either case, at which a final vote with respect to the adoption of the
merger agreement was taken, then CommerceHub shall, following receipt of an invoice therefor, no later than three business days after the date of such termination, pay, or cause to be paid, at
the direction of Parent, up to $5 million of Parent's reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) incurred by Parent
and its affiliates on or prior to the termination of the merger agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        If a party fails promptly to pay to the other party any amounts due and, in order to obtain such payment, such other party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the failing
party the non-prevailing party shall pay to the prevailing party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest.

Specific Performance 

        CommerceHub, Parent, and Merger Sub will be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to seek enforcement specifically of the terms
and provisions of the merger agreement. This is in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

        CommerceHub will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the
merger and cause the equity financing to be funded only in the event that:

• all conditions applicable to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations have been and continue to be satisfied or waived but for the failure of the equity financing to be funded; 

• the debt financing has been funded or will be funded at the closing if the equity financing is funded at the closing; and 

• CommerceHub has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the equity financing and the debt financing are funded, then
CommerceHub will take such actions as are within its control to effect the closing.

Amendments; Waiver 

        The merger agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented at any time solely by additional written agreements signed by, or on behalf of the parties, as may mutually be
determined by the parties to be necessary, desirable or expedient to further the purpose of the merger agreement or to clarify the intention of the parties, whether before or after adoption of the
merger agreement by CommerceHub stockholders or adoption of the merger agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub; provided, however, that after adoption of the merger agreement
by CommerceHub stockholders

or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, no amendment may be made that would require further approval or adoption without such further approval or adoption.

        No provision of the merger agreement may be waived except by a written instrument signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege in the merger agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER SPECIFIED COMPENSATION (PROPOSAL 2) 

        The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in July 2010, requires that CommerceHub provide holders of voting stock with the opportunity to cast a non-
binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may become payable to CommerceHub's named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in this proxy statement,
including as described in "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger." This vote is commonly referred to as a "say on golden parachute" vote. This non-binding,
advisory proposal relates only to contractual obligations of CommerceHub that may result in a payment to CommerceHub's named executive officers in connection with, or following, the
consummation of the merger, and does not relate to any new compensation or other arrangements between CommerceHub's named executive officers and Parent. Further, this proposal does not
relate to any compensation arrangements that are or may become applicable to CommerceHub's directors or executive officers who are not named executive officers.

        As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon CommerceHub or our board. Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and this vote is separate from
the other proposals at the special meeting. Accordingly, you may vote to approve such other proposals to be considered and vote not to approve the advisory compensation proposal, and vice
versa. Because the vote on the advisory compensation proposal is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on CommerceHub. To the extent that CommerceHub is contractually obligated
to pay the compensation, such compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote. These payments are a part of
CommerceHub's comprehensive executive compensation program and are intended to align CommerceHub's named executive officers' interests with yours as stockholders by ensuring their
continued retention and commitment during critical events such as the merger, which may create significant personal uncertainty for them.

        The advisory compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the shares of our voting stock present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special meeting, voting together as a single class. Under our bylaws, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
"AGAINST" this proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting results for this proposal (assuming a quorum is present).

Our board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the advisory compensation proposal.

VOTE ON ADJOURNMENT (PROPOSAL 3) 

        CommerceHub is asking its stockholders to approve a proposal for one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if we have
not obtained sufficient affirmative stockholder votes to adopt the merger agreement. If, at the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting), the number of
shares of voting stock present in person or by proxy and voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is not sufficient to approve that proposal, we may move to adjourn the
special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting) in order to enable our directors, officers, employees and representatives to solicit additional proxies for the
adoption of the merger agreement. In that event, we will ask CommerceHub stockholders to vote only upon the adjournment proposal, and not the merger agreement proposal. If
CommerceHub stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the special meeting, and any adjourned session or postponement of the special meeting, and use the
additional time to solicit additional proxies.

        The adjournment proposal relates only to an adjournment of the special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting) for purposes of soliciting additional proxies
to obtain the requisite stockholder approval to adopt the merger agreement. CommerceHub retains full authority to the extent set forth in its bylaws and under Delaware law to adjourn the
special meeting for any other purpose, or to postpone the special meeting before it is convened, without the consent of any CommerceHub stockholder.

        Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the shares of our voting stock present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal at the special meeting, voting together as a single class. Under our bylaws, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
"AGAINST" this proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting results for this proposal (assuming a quorum is present).

Our board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

MARKET PRICE OF COMMERCEHUB'S COMMON STOCK 

        Our Series A common stock and Series C common stock are traded on the Nasdaq under the symbols "CHUBA" and "CHUBK," respectively. The following table sets forth during the
periods indicated (beginning following the Spin-Off) the high and low sales prices of our Series A common stock and our Series C common stock:

        Our Series B common stock is not listed, but it is quoted and traded in the OTC Markets under the symbol "CHUBB." Although it is quoted on the OTC Markets, it is sparsely traded and
does not have an active trading market. There is a greater chance of market volatility for securities that trade on the OTC Markets as opposed to a national exchange or quotation system, which
is due to a variety of factors, including a lack of readily available price quotations, lower trading volume, absence of consistent administrative supervision of "bid" and "ask" quotations, and
market conditions. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated (beginning following the Spin-Off), the range of high and low bid information for our Series B common stock as
reported by the OTC Markets. The information below represents inter-dealer prices without dealer mark-ups, mark-downs or commissions, and may not be indicative of the value of the
Series B common stock or the existence of an active market.

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, all outstanding shares of CommerceHub's Series A common stock, B common stock, and C common stock will be acquired for a total value of
approximately $1.1 billion. Each holder of CommerceHub's Series A common stock, Series B common stock and Series C common stock will receive $22.75 in cash per share, representing a
24.5% premium to the Series A common stock closing price as of March 5, 2018, a 19.3% premium to the one-month volume-weighted average Series A common stock closing price, a 30.2%
premium to the Series C common stock closing price as of March 5, 2018, and a 27.1% premium to the one-month volume-weighted average Series C common stock closing price. The
Series B common stock, which is convertible on a one-for-one basis at the option of the holder into shares of Series A common stock, is, as noted above, sparsely traded and does not have an
active trading market or readily available price quotations.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS 

        The following discussion summarizes the material terms of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the
DGCL, which we refer to as Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. The following summary does not constitute legal or other advice, nor does it constitute a
recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.

        The holders of Series A common stock, Series B common stock and Series C common stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger in accordance with Section 262.
Under Section 262, record holders of shares of common stock who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who otherwise follow the procedures set forth in
Section 262 will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the "fair value" of the shares, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, as determined by the Court, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.

        Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its
stockholders who was a stockholder of record for notice of the meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This
proxy statement constitutes such notice, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C.

        ANY HOLDER OF COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, OR WHO WISHES TO PRESERVE SUCH HOLDER'S RIGHT TO DO SO, SHOULD
CAREFULLY REVIEW THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANNEX C BECAUSE FAILURE TO TIMELY AND PROPERLY COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURES SPECIFIED
WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO SEEK
APPRAISAL OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, COMMERCEHUB BELIEVES THAT, IF A STOCKHOLDER CONSIDERS EXERCISING SUCH RIGHTS, SUCH STOCKHOLDER
SHOULD SEEK THE ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL.

        If a holder of common stock loses his, her or its appraisal rights by failing to timely comply with the procedures of Section 262 or otherwise, such holder of common stock will be entitled
to receive the merger consideration described in the merger agreement.

Filing Written Demand 

        Any holder of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must, before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting, deliver to CommerceHub a written
demand for the appraisal of the stockholder's shares. A holder of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal
is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective date of the merger. The holder will lose appraisal rights if the holder transfers the shares before the effective date of
the merger. The holder must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will result in the submitting stockholder losing such stockholder's right of appraisal and will effectively nullify any previously delivered
written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares of common stock. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy
containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger
agreement, nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying

the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. The demand must
reasonably inform CommerceHub of the identity of the holder as well as the intention of the holder to demand an appraisal of the shares held by the holder. A stockholder's failure to deliver
the written demand to CommerceHub prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will result in such stockholder losing such stockholder's
right of appraisal.

        Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that holder's name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of common
stock must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record. The demand must set forth, fully and correctly, the registered holder's name as it appears on the holder's stock certificates (or
other registration records if uncertificated) and must specify the holder's mailing address and the number of shares registered in the holder's name. The demand must state that the person
intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder's shares. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of the demand must
be made in that capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy-in-common or other joint ownership, the demand must be executed
by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the
agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. If the shares are held in "street
name" by a broker, bank, trust or nominee, the broker, bank, trust or nominee may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners while not
exercising the rights with respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners; in such case, however, the written demand should set forth the number of shares as to which appraisal is sought
and where no number of shares is expressly mentioned the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of common stock held in the name of the record owner. If a stockholder holds shares of
common stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee, a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the
depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder. Stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise
appraisal rights are urged to consult with their brokers to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee. A person having a beneficial
interest in shares held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow properly in a timely manner the steps
necessary to perfect appraisal rights.

        All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 must be delivered to CommerceHub at:

CommerceHub, Inc.
201 Fuller Road, 6th Floor
Albany, New York 12203

Attention: Secretary

        At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may
withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement by delivering to CommerceHub, as the Surviving Corporation, a written
withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will require written approval of
CommerceHub, as the Surviving Corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court
of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however, that any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger

agreement within 60 days after the effective date of the merger. If CommerceHub, as the Surviving Corporation, does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that
approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such stockholder's demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value
determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the consideration being offered pursuant to the merger agreement.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation 

        Within ten days after the effective date of the merger, CommerceHub, as the Surviving Corporation, must notify each holder of common stock who has complied with Section 262, and
who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, of the date on which the merger became effective.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal 

        Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, but not thereafter, CommerceHub, as the Surviving Corporation, or any holder of common stock who has complied with
Section 262 and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served
upon the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the value of the shares held by all such dissenting holders. CommerceHub, as the
Surviving Corporation, is under no obligation to and has no present intention to file such a petition and holders of common stock should not assume that CommerceHub as the Surviving
Corporation will file such a petition. Accordingly, any holders of common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to demand appraisal and perfect
their appraisal rights in respect of shares of common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of common stock who
has complied with the requirements of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from CommerceHub as the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate
number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such
shares. The statement must be mailed within ten days after a written request therefor has been received by CommerceHub as the Surviving Corporation or within ten days after the expiration
of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held either in a voting
trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from CommerceHub as the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this
paragraph. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to appraisal will cease.

        If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon CommerceHub as the Surviving Corporation, CommerceHub as the
Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have
demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the dissenting stockholders, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The
Delaware Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares and who had stock represented by certificates to submit their stock certificates to the
Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the

appraisal proceeding; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.

        With respect to the shares of common stock that are listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective date of the merger, the Delaware Court of Chancery shall
dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal
exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.

Determination of Fair Value 

        After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the
Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Court shall determine the "fair value" of the shares, exclusive of
any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Unless the Court
in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall
accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment.

        At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, CommerceHub, as the Surviving Corporation, may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which
case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided in Section 262 only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time.

        In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors
that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the
financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered and that "[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company."
The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the
enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair
value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that
such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 to mean that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are
known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered." In addition, Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal
remedy, in cases of unfair dealing, may or may not be a dissenter's exclusive remedy. Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so
determined could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an investment
banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address,
fair value under Section 262. No representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and

stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger consideration. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor
CommerceHub anticipate offering more than the applicable merger consideration to any stockholder of CommerceHub exercising appraisal rights, and reserve the right to assert, in any
appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the "fair value" of a share of common stock is less than the applicable merger consideration.

        The costs of the action (which do not include attorneys' fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable
under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares
entitled to be appraised.

        If any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal, the
stockholder's shares of common stock will be deemed to have been converted as of the effective date of the merger into the right to receive the merger consideration pursuant to the merger
agreement. A stockholder will lose, the holder's right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger. In addition, as described above and
subject to the timing considerations discussed above, a stockholder may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 and accept the merger consideration
offered pursuant to the merger agreement.

        Any holder of shares of common stock who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not, after the effective date of the merger, be entitled to vote for any purpose
any shares subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date
prior to the effective date of the merger.

        FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE STEPS REQUIRED BY SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL FOR DEMANDING AND PERFECTING APPRAISAL RIGHTS WILL RESULT IN THE
LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IN THAT EVENT, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR DISSENTING SHARES IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE MERGER AGREEMENT. IN VIEW OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL, IF YOU ARE A COMPANY
STOCKHOLDER AND ARE CONSIDERING EXERCISING YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS UNDER THE DGCL, YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN LEGAL ADVISOR.

OTHER MATTERS 

        Our board is not currently aware of any business to be acted on at the special meeting other than that which is described in this proxy statement. If, however, any other matters are
properly brought to a vote at the special meeting, the persons designated as proxies will have discretion to vote or to act on those matters in accordance with their best judgment.

MULTIPLE STOCKHOLDERS SHARING ONE ADDRESS 

        In accordance with Rule 14a-3(e)(1) under the Exchange Act, one proxy statement will be delivered to two or more stockholders who share an address, unless CommerceHub has received
contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders. CommerceHub will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared
address to which a single copy of the proxy statement was delivered. Requests for additional copies of the proxy statement should be directed to CommerceHub, Inc., 201 Fuller Road,
6th Floor, Albany, New York 12203, Attn: Secretary, or by calling (518) 810-0700. In addition, stockholders who share a single address, but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, may
request that in the future they receive a single copy by contacting CommerceHub at the address and phone number set forth in the prior sentence.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        We will hold our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders only if the merger is not completed because, if the merger is completed, CommerceHub will cease to be an independent public
company and will become a subsidiary of Parent and you will no longer have an ownership interest in CommerceHub.

        Any stockholder proposals submitted pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 for presentation at the 2018 annual meeting must have been received by CommerceHub on or before
December 29, 2017 to be eligible for inclusion in CommerceHub's proxy statement in connection with that meeting. Any such proposal should have been submitted in writing to our Secretary
and received at our executive offices at 201 Fuller Road, 6th Floor, Albany, New York 12203. However, if the date of the 2018 annual meeting is changed by more than 30 days before or
30 days after June 16, 2018 (the one-year anniversary of the 2017 annual meeting), then the deadline will be the close of business on the tenth day following the first day on which notice of the
date of the 2018 annual meeting is communicated to stockholders or public disclosure of the date of the 2018 annual meeting is made, whichever occurs first.

        Any stockholder proposals (including recommendations of nominees for election to our board) intended to be presented at our 2018 annual meeting, other than a stockholder proposal
submitted pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14a-8, must be received at our executive offices at the foregoing address not earlier than March 16, 2018 and not later than April 17, 2018. However,
if the 2018 annual meeting takes place more than 30 days before or 30 days after June 16, 2018 (the one-year anniversary of the 2017 annual meeting), a stockholder proposal, or any
nomination by stockholders of a person or persons for election to our board, will instead be required to be received at our executive offices at the foregoing address not later than the close of
business on the tenth day following the first day on which notice of the date of the 2018 annual meeting is communicated to stockholders or public disclosure of the date of the 2018 annual
meeting is made, whichever occurs first.

        All stockholder proposals for inclusion in our proxy materials will be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted under the Exchange Act, our charter and bylaws and Delaware
law.

contemplated by the DGCL, together with any required related certificates, filings or recordings with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed

at such later date and time as the Company and Parent may agree upon and as is set forth in such Certificate of Merger (such time, the "Effective Time").

        Section 2.4    Closing.     Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall occur no later than the second
(2nd) Business Day after all of the conditions set forth in Article VI shall have been satisfied or waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the same (other than conditions which by their
terms are required to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other time and on a date as agreed to by the parties in writing

        Section 2.6    Effect on Common Stock.     

        (a)    Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.    At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub, any Company Stockholder or any other Person, each share of Company Common Stock (i) owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or held in the Company's treasury)
immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

        (b)    Effect on Company Common Stock.    Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.6(a) and Section 2.6(e), and subject to Section 2.6(d), and except as otherwise agreed to by

action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, any Company Stockholder or any other Person:

          (i)  Each share of Series A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into the right to receive
$22.75 in cash, without interest thereon (the "Series A Consideration");

         (ii)  Each share of Series B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into the right to receive

fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $0.01 per share (the "Surviving Corporation Common Stock"). Such shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of immediately following the Effective Time.

        (d)    Changes to Stock.    If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Company Common Stock
shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, split-up, exchange or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, or any similar transaction or event, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided that nothing in this Section 2.6(d) shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

        (e)    Dissenting Shares; Appraisal Rights.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.6(b), but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL to a holder of
Dissenting Shares, unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost such holder's right to appraisal under the DGCL. If any
Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (by the holder thereof effectively withdrawing, failing to perfect, or otherwise losing such holder's appraisal rights under the DGCL
with respect to such shares), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.6(b), without interest, and shall not thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The
Company shall give Parent prompt (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) written notice of any demand or threatened demand for appraisal of shares of Company Common
Stock received by the Company, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the
DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands under the
DGCL consistent with the obligations of the Company thereunder. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to
settle or settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the
voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the Surviving Corporation or of a stockholder of Parent.

        Section 2.7    Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares.     

        (a)    Exchange Agent.    Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select an institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in
the Merger for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration. Parent will make available to the Exchange Agent, at or prior to the
Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(b), which shall not include, for the avoidance of doubt, any Merger
Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares or, for the avoidance of doubt, the Stock Option Merger Consideration, the Restricted Stock Merger Consideration or the RSU
Merger Consideration (such amount, the "Exchange Fund"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares who have not subsequently withdrawn or lost their rights of appraisal)
(i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that

delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or by appropriate guarantee of
delivery in the form customarily used in transactions of this nature from a member of a national securities exchange, a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or a
commercial bank or trust company in the United States) for use in effecting delivery of shares to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereof.

        (b)    Exchange Procedure.    Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.6(b), upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or upon receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) with respect to the exchange of Book Entry Shares, will be entitled to receive an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.6 and Article II. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, each Certificate and Book Entry Share shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all
purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.6(b).

        (c)    Certificate Holder.    If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to the payment thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

        (d)    No Further Ownership Rights.    The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares), subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates or Book Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

        (e)    Termination of Exchange Fund.    Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the Company Stockholders for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any Company Stockholder who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time
when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

        (f)    No Liability.    None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official to the extent required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

        (g)    Lost Certificates.    If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent) of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate.

        (h)    Withholding Rights.    Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement (including the Stock Option Merger Consideration, the Restricted Stock Merger Consideration and the RSU
Merger Consideration) such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted or withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

        (i)    No Further Dividends.    No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any un-surrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares.

substitute for or otherwise make arrangements to replace or exchange any Company Equity Award in connection with the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated herein. As of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, each Company Equity Award shall be cancelled and treated in the following
manner:

          (i)  Company Stock Options.    As of the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company Stock Option (whether or not vested or exercisable and automatically without
any further action required of the holder of any such Company Stock Option) shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto but
shall instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the result of (A) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option multiplied by (y) the Series A Consideration, the Series B Consideration or the Series C Consideration, as applicable tothe Company Common Stock underlying
such Company Stock Option, minus (B) the aggregate exercise price of such Company Stock Option (the "Stock Option Merger Consideration"); provided, however, that if the
per share exercise price of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the applicable Series A Consideration, Series B Consideration or Series C Consideration,
such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and terminated without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the
Stock Option Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, at the Effective Time or as soon practicable thereafter (but in no event later than the date which is the later of
(x) seven (7) Business Days after the Effective Time and (y) the date of the Company's first regularly scheduled payroll after the Effective Time).

         (ii)  Company Restricted Stock.    As of the Effective Time, each then outstanding share of Company Restricted Stock (whether or not vested and automatically without
any further action required of the holder of any such Company Restricted Stock) shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto but
shall instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Restricted Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Series A Consideration, the Series B Consideration or the Series C Consideration, as applicable to the Company
Common Stock underlying the Company Restricted Stock (the "Restricted Stock Merger Consideration"). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Restricted
Stock Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, at the Effective Time or as soon practicable thereafter (but in no event later than the date which is the later of (x) seven
(7) Business Days after the Effective Time and (y) the date of the Company's first regularly scheduled payroll after the Effective Time).

applicable to the Company Equity Awards under any Incentive Plan and any agreements issued under any Incentive Plan, including (i) making any determinations and/or resolutions of
the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof or any administrator of an Incentive Plan as may be necessary and (ii) providing all Company Equity Award holders with
any advance notice required under any Incentive Plan and terminating the Incentive Plans effective as of the Effective Time, so that, following the Effective Time, there shall be no
outstanding Incentive Plans, Company Equity Awards (vested or unvested) or obligations or Liabilities to holders of Company Equity Awards, other than (x) payment of the Equity
Award Merger Consideration as set forth in this Section 2.8 and (y) those Company RSUs that remain outstanding following the Effective Time as described on Section 2.8(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. The Company (including the Board of Directors of the Company and each relevant committee thereof) will take all actions necessary to ensure that,

offering period in effect under the ESPP that is scheduled to end after the Effective Time (the "Final Offering Period"), the Offering Period End Date shall constitute the last day of the

service provider or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) trigger any payment for funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or

operated as of the date hereof is subject to any "open source," "copyleft" or analogous license (including any license approved by the Open Source Initiative and listed at
http://www.opensource.org/licenses, GPL, AGPL or other open source software license) in a manner or relation which has or would require any public distribution of any such software

personally identifiable information or other legally protected information relating to individuals, in each case that is processed or stored by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, was or may have been improperly accessed by an unauthorized outside Person or improperly disclosed and such access or disclosure would be reasonably likely to result
in material liability to the Company, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notices from any Person with respect thereto.

        (f)    Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect, there have not been any data breaches with respect to, unauthorized
intrusions on, access to, or use of any of the Company Systems or the Company's products that have resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in the destruction, damage, loss,

exposed any Person to, any hazardous substance, material or waste, or owned or operated any property or facility contaminated by any hazardous substance, material or waste, in each case so

flex", pricing caps and other economic terms) fee letter from the financial institutions identified therein (the "Debt Commitment Letter" and, together with the Equity Commitment
Letter, the "Financing Commitment Letters") to provide, on the terms and subject only to the conditions expressly stated therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter (being collectively referred to as the "Debt Financing" and, together with the Equity Financing, the "Financing"), in each case for the purpose of satisfying the
obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub in this Agreement and the Financing Commitment Letters (including payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, any payment of any
other fees and expenses and obligations required to be paid or satisfied by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Financing (the "Required Amount"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides that the Company is an express third party beneficiary thereof and Parent and the
Guarantors will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with the proper exercise of such third party beneficiary rights.

        (b)   None of the Financing Commitment Letters have been amended, restated or otherwise modified (except for amendments, restatements and modifications that are not

restatement, modification or waiver thereto is contemplated. As of the date of this Agreement, no Guarantor has notified Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate the Equity
Commitment Letter or not to provide the Equity Financing. The funding of the Financing on the terms set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters is not subject to any conditions
precedent or other similar

contingencies other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letters are in full force and effect
and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and (to the Knowledge of Parent) each other party thereto, enforceable against each party thereto in
accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, rehabilitation, liquidation,
preferential transfer, moratorium and similar Laws now or hereafter affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at equity or law)).

        (c)   There are no side letters or other written or oral agreements, Contracts, arrangements, conditions precedent, contingencies or other provisions relating to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing needed on the Closing Date to pay the Required Amount.

        (d)   Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable, and (ii) completion of the Marketing
Period and that the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 will be satisfied on the Closing Date, the net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter and the
Debt Commitment Letter (both before and after giving effect to any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter) will in the aggregate be sufficient for Parent and
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay the Required Amount.

        (e)   (i) As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which would constitute or would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or default (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default) on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or (to the Knowledge of Parent) any other party,
under any Financing Commitment Letter, and (ii) assuming the completion of the Marketing Period and the accuracy in all material respects of the Company's representations and
warranties contained in Article III hereof, as of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing, whether or not such term or condition is
contained in the Financing Commitment Letters, will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing needed to pay the Required Amount will not be available to Parent or
Merger Sub on or prior to the Closing Date for purposes of paying the Required Amount. As of the date hereof, the Parent has fully paid any and all commitment and other fees, costs
and expenses that are required to be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Financing Commitment Letters or otherwise in connection with the Financing.

        Section 4.9    Solvency.     Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger, and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Financing, (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III hereof, (c) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, are Solvent immediately prior to the Closing and (d) all material cost estimates, financial or other projections of the Company provided to Parent by the Company have been prepared in
good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, at and as of the Effective Time, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to Article II in, or as a result of, the Merger, and all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries in connection therewith), Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation, taken as a whole, will be Solvent.

any delay in obtaining, or increase the risk of not obtaining, the consent of any regulatory authority necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the expiration or termination under any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Authority seeking or entering an
Order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or imposing conditions on any such authorization, consent, Order or approval of any

        Section 5.2    No Solicitation.     

        (a)    Cessation of Discussions Regarding Alternative Transactions.    The Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of the directors, officers and employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates and the Representatives of the Company to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated, any and all existing activities, discussions, information sharing, solicitations, encouragement or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Alternative Transaction Proposal or Inquiry and promptly (but in any event within forty-eight (48) hours after the execution of this Agreement) shall request that all non-public
information previously provided by or on behalf of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to any such Person be returned or destroyed in
accordance with any applicable confidentiality agreement between the Company and such Person. The Company shall not, and shall direct and cause its Subsidiaries and each of the
directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to, and shall not
authorize or permit any of the foregoing to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or initiate, or knowingly facilitate or encourage, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction Proposal, (ii) enter into, engage, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or grant access to or furnish to any Person any non-public information or data with respect to, or to knowingly cooperate in any way that would otherwise reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Alternative Transaction Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse, recommend, execute or enter into any agreement, arrangement, understanding, Contract, commitment
or agreement in principle, including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or similar agreement, with respect to an Alternative Transaction Proposal or enter into any agreement, Contract or commitment that requires the Company to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may communicate with any Person that makes an Alternative Transaction Proposal solely and exclusively to direct such
Person to the restrictions imposed by this Section 5.2 provided that the Company shall simultaneously provide Parent with a copy of any such communications.

        (b)    Unsolicited Alternative Transaction Proposals.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement, in the event that the
Company receives after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, an unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal (which
Alternative Transaction Proposal did not, directly or indirectly, result from or arise out of a material breach of this Section 5.2) that (x) the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) to be, or to be reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (y) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company and its Representatives may then take the following actions:

          (i)  furnish any nonpublic information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to, the Person or group (and their respective Representatives) making such
Alternative Transaction Proposal and afford access to the business, properties, assets, books and records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, that prior to
furnishing any such information, it receives from such Person or group an executed confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality terms at least as restrictive and at least
as favorable to the Company

commercially sensitive nonpublic information to any competitor in connection with the actions permitted by this Section 5.2(b), except in a manner consistent with the

(which information shall simultaneously be provided to Parent and its Representatives to the extent such information has not previously been made available to Parent or its
Representatives); and

         (ii)  engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group (and their Representatives) with respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

        (c)    Notification.    In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.2(a), Section 5.2(b), Section 5.2(d) and Section 5.2(e) hereof, as promptly as practicable

reasonably likely lead to, any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any requests for nonpublic information from, or any discussions or negotiations being sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or Representatives (any of the foregoing, an "Inquiry"), the
Company shall provide Parent with written notice of such Alternative Transaction Proposal or Inquiry, which notice shall include a written summary of the material terms and
conditions thereof and copies of any proposed material written agreements or material correspondence exchanged between the Person (or its Representatives) making an Alternative
Transaction Proposal or Inquiry and the Company (or its Representatives). In addition, the Company shall provide Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-

written or material oral communications regarding, and the status of, and any material developments regarding, any such Alternative Transaction Proposal or Inquiry and (B) all
material nonpublic information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to the Person making such Alternative Transaction Proposal or Inquiry which was not previously

(or amend or modify in any manner adverse to Parent) or publicly propose to withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation

any modification thereto) shall have become publicly known or upon any one other request by Parent, or (F) resolve or publicly propose to take any action described in the foregoing
clauses (A) through (E) (any action described in the foregoing clauses (A) through (F) being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"); or (ii) except as provided
herein, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,

any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (A) solely in response to either (x) an Intervening Event or (y) a Superior Proposal received after the date hereof, the
Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (B) solely in
the case of a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) and substantially concurrently enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (a "Company Acquisition Agreement"), if, in the case of either clause (A) or (B):

          (i)  in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal, and such Superior
Proposal did not, directly or indirectly, result from or arise out of a breach of this Section 5.2);

         (ii)  the Company Stockholder Approval has not been obtained;

        (iii)  the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Intervening Event or Superior Proposal, as applicable, the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or, solely in response to a Superior Proposal, terminate
this Agreement and enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, would reasonably be likely to violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law;

        (iv)  the Company shall have (1) provided Parent four (4) Business Days' prior written notice (such period of time, the "Company Notice Period"), which notice shall state
(x) that the Company has received a Superior Proposal or there has been an Intervening Event, (y) (I) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the material terms of such Superior
Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and which notice shall include a copy of all relevant transaction documents with respect thereto

Board that an Intervening Event has occurred, in reasonable detail, and (z) that in response to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event the Company intends to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or, solely in response to a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement and enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with

requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent during the Company Notice Period to amend this Agreement and the other transaction documents
contemplated herein as would enable the Board of Directors to maintain the Company Recommendation and not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement, (3) considered in good faith any bona fide offer made by Parent to the Company during the Company Notice Period, and (4) following the expiration

amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) with respect to an Alternative Transaction Proposal or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; provided however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and its Board of Directors may not effect a Company

practicable (but in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days) following (i) the completion of any review or clearance (including deemed clearance) by the SEC or (ii) the
expiration of the ten (10) day period after the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement in the event the SEC does not affirmatively notify the Company during such period that
it will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement (the first to occur, the "SEC Clearance Date" as the same may be amended in the event that any additional review or
clearance by the SEC is required following the occurrence of an SEC Clearance Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (1) the Company has not mailed, and was not
reasonably able to mail, the Proxy Statement by July 27, 2018 and (2) the Marketing Period has not commenced by July 30, 2018, the Company will not be required to mail the
Proxy Statement sooner than August 29, 2018 unless, on or after July 30, 2018 and prior to August 29, 2018, Parent provides notice to the Company that it has determined in its
sole discretion to eliminate in its entirety, to terminate early or to reduce the total number of consecutive Business Days required for the completion of the Marketing Period
such that the Marketing Period could be completed no less than three (3) Business Days prior to the date the Company Stockholders' Meeting will be held if the Proxy
Statement is mailed within ten (10) business days thereafter (the Marketing Period, modified for such reduced number of Business Days, the "Reduced Marketing Period")

Company Stockholders as soon as practicable, but in any event no later than the later of ten (10) Business Days following (x) the Mailing Acceleration Event or (y) the SEC
Clearance Date.

         (ii)  All filings by the Company with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and all mailings to the Company Stockholders in connection with
the Merger and transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the prior review and reasonable comment by Parent (which comments shall be considered by the
Company in good faith) and the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity and time period to review and comment on all such filings.

        (iii)  The Company shall (A) as promptly as practicable notify Parent of (1) the receipt of any comments or requests from the SEC, its staff or any other government

"Company Stockholders' Meeting"), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material

order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.

         (v)  If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers is
discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

        (b)    Company Stockholders' Meeting.    

          (i)  The Company shall duly give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting (with the record date and meeting date set in reasonable consultation
with Parent) as promptly as practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement (but in any event within thirty (30) days after the mailing of the Proxy Statement) to the
Company Stockholders for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval (or following the adjournment of the Company Stockholders' Meeting under certain
circumstances) and, unless the Board of Directors has enacted a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event or Superior Proposal in
accordance with (and after satisfying all requirements and obligations set forth in) Section 5.2(e), shall (A) recommend to its stockholders adoption of this Agreement and
include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit such adoption and obtain the Company Stockholder Approval.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may only adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders' Meeting (x) to the extent
necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders in advance of a vote on the adoption of this Agreement
(y), if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting or (z) as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable Law; provided, that in the
case of any of clause (x), (y), or (z), the Company Stockholders' Meeting shall only be adjourned or postponed for a minimum period of time reasonable under the
circumstances (it being understood that any such adjournment or postponement shall not affect the Company's obligation to hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting in
accordance with this Section 5.3(b)). For the avoidance of doubt, unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Article VII, the Company shall establish a record date
for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL,
whether or not the Board of Directors at any time subsequent to the date hereof shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Without the prior written
consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than
adjournment and similar procedural matters) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company's stockholders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting. The
Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders' Meeting is called,

the rules of NASDAQ and the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws. Beginning on the day that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders'
Meeting and until the Company Stockholders' Meeting is held, the Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent as to the aggregate tally of proxies
received by the Company with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval and the votes to be made thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company's obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3(b)(i) (which, for the avoidance of doubt, are subject to Section 5.2(e)) shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or by a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(i).

         (ii)  Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.2(e), (A) the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of the

schedule and other document filed or received pursuant to the requirements of the federal securities laws or a Governmental Authority, except, with respect to examination reports, as
may be restricted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to disclose any information that, in its good faith determination, (i) it is not
legally permitted to disclose or the disclosure of which would contravene any applicable Law or Order or (ii) the disclosure of which would be reasonably likely to cause the loss or
waiver of any attorney-client or other legal privilege or trade secret protection; provided that, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable description of such information and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to disclose such information, or a portion thereof, without contravening such applicable Law or Order or losing or waiving any attorney-client
privilege or trade secret protection. The Company shall be entitled to have Representatives present at all times during any such inspection, and all inspections granted pursuant to this
Section 5.4 shall be subject to the Company's reasonable security measures and insurance requirements. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 or information provided, made

and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and (iv) furnish the other with such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the Company or Parent, as applicable, may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any
such third party.

        (c)    Certain Actions.    In furtherance of the covenants set forth in Section 5.5(a), if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
domestic or foreign antitrust or Competition Law or if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other
applicable Governmental Authority challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby or which would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Parent shall take all reasonable actions necessary to resolve any such objections or Actions (or threatened Actions) so as to permit consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby to close as soon as reasonably practicable.

        Section 5.6    State Takeover Statutes.     In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (a) take all action necessary to ensure that no "fair price,"
"business combination," "control share acquisition" or other state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and (b) if any "fair price," "business combination," "control share acquisition" or other state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms required by, or provided for, in this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        Section 5.7    Indemnification and Insurance.     

        (a)   For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or in
such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of directors and officers and advancement
of fees, costs and expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, each as in
effect on the date hereof. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and comply with their respective
obligations under any indemnification agreement with any present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") in effect as of
the date hereof, and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such agreement in any manner that would materially adversely affect any indemnification right of any Indemnified
Person thereunder.

        (b)   Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, as of the Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers'
liability coverage of the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "D&O Insurance"),
which D&O Insurance shall (i) be for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of
time at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) be from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance
and (iii) have terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies with respect to any actual
or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against an Indemnified Person by reason of his or her having served in
such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the

Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the D&O
Insurance in place with the Company's current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect
to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies, or the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase from the Company's current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier
with respect to D&O Insurance comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided
in the Company's existing policies; provided that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the premium amount per annum for the Company's existing policies; and provided, further, that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

        (c)   If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.7. The obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any successors or assigns under this Section 5.7 shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years
from the Effective Time (or if later the expiration of all statutes of limitations applicable to any such claim); provided, that if any claim (whether arising before, at or after the Effective
Time) is brought against an Indemnified Person on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.7 shall continue in effect solely with respect to
such Indemnified Person until the full and final resolution of such claim.

        Section 5.8    Public Announcements.     The Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing, and will provide each other the opportunity to review and reasonably
comment upon, and use reasonable best efforts to agree on, any press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
except as either party, after consultation with outside counsel, may determine (x) is required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or stock market if it has used reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party prior thereto regarding the timing, scope and content of any such press release
or public statement and (y) that making further attempts for consultation would reasonably be likely to result in a violation of such Law, court process or obligation; provided, however, that no
such consultation shall be required to make any disclosure or otherwise take any action expressly permitted by Section 5.2. In addition, except (i) to the extent disclosed in or consistent with
the Proxy Statement in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3, (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the Company's periodic reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, (iii) for
any consent given in accordance with this Section 5.8 or (iv) as expressly permitted by Section 5.2, neither party shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or
disclosure concerning the other party or the other party's business, financial condition or results of operations without the consent of such other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld,

Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the issuance of any press release or the making of any public statement with respect to which the consultation procedures set forth in this Section 5.8 have
been followed, either party may issue such additional publications or press releases and make such other customary announcements without consulting with any other party hereto so long as
such additional publications, press releases and announcements do not disclose any non-public information regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement beyond the scope of, and
are reasonably consistent in tone and tenor with, the disclosure included in the press release or public statement with respect to which the other party had been consulted.

        Section 5.9    Certain Tax Matters.     Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and Merger Sub and that complies with Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h), to the effect that interests in the Company are not United States real property interests and (ii) provide
a corresponding notice to the IRS, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Merger Sub and that complies with the requirements set forth in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.897-2(h)(2), to the effect that interests in the Company are not United States real property interests, with a copy of such executed and filed notice provided to Parent and Merger Sub.

        Section 5.10    Employee Benefits.     

        (a)   For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date (or, if shorter, the period of employment of the relevant Company Employee), the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing who remain employed by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing (the "Company
Employees") shall receive (i) annual base salary or wages (which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes incentive compensation whether payable in cash or equity), as applicable, that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to the annual base salary or wages in effect for each such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) employee benefits and other
cash compensation (other than any equity or equity-based, defined benefit pension, and nonqualified deferred compensation benefits) that, in the aggregate, are substantially similar to
the employee benefits and other cash compensation (other than any equity or equity-based, defined benefit pension, and nonqualified deferred compensation benefits) provided by or on
behalf of the Company to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, that, except as provided in Section 5.10(c), nothing contained in this Section 5.10
shall be construed as requiring Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to continue or adopt any specific plans or to continue the employment of any
specific Person.

        (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, starting on the Closing Date, Parent and Surviving Corporation shall, for a period ending on the date one (1) year
after the Closing Date, maintain a severance pay practice for the benefit of each Company Employee that is substantially similar in the aggregate to the severance pay practice in effect
and applicable to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.

        (c)   With respect to any annual incentive bonuses that may be payable to Company Employees under the Company's annual bonus plan in respect of the year in which the Closing
Date occurs, Parent or one of its Affiliates shall adopt and maintain such bonus plan and pay such bonuses in the ordinary course, subject to the performance and service requirements
and other terms and conditions of the annual incentive plan as established by the Company prior to the Closing.

        (d)   Parent shall recognize the service of Company Employees with the Company or its Subsidiaries (or their respective Affiliates) prior to the Closing Date as service with Parent

Affiliates in connection with any employee benefit plans, programs, Contracts and arrangements (including 401(k) plans, vacation, sick leave and holiday policies) maintained by
Parent and its Affiliates which is made available following the Closing Date by Parent and its Affiliates for purposes of any waiting period, vesting and eligibility (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit plan) to the extent such service was credited for the same purpose under the corresponding Company Plan
prior to Closing; provided, however, that no such service shall be credited to the extent that doing so would result in the duplication of benefits.

        (e)   Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause its insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing and
at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company Employees under any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA) which is made available to Company Employees following the Closing Date by Parent or one of its Affiliates to the extent such limitations or conditions would have been
satisfied or waived under the terms of the comparable Company Plan prior to Closing, and (ii) provide credit to Company Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-
pocket expenses paid by such employees under the corresponding Company Plan during the portion of the relevant plan year including the Closing Date.

        (f)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any employee benefit plan or
arrangement, or shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Plan or any other benefit or
compensation plan or arrangement sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates following the Closing Date. In the event that (i) a Person not a party to this
Agreement makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any employee benefit plan or arrangement sponsored by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such plan or arrangement even though not explicitly designated as such in this
Agreement, then such provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect. The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section 5.10 with
respect to the Company Employees are included for the sole benefit of the parties, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any third party
beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other Person, including any employees, former employees, any participant in any employee benefit plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof,
or (B) to continued employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates.

        Section 5.11    Notification of Certain Matters.     

        (a)   The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, as the case may be, of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
of which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to be untrue or inaccurate at the Closing Date such that the applicable
conditions to closing set forth in Article VI would fail to be satisfied, and (ii) any failure by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to materially comply with or materially satisfy
any covenant or other agreement to be complied with by it hereunder such that the applicable conditions to closing set forth in Article VI would fail to be satisfied; provided, however,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.11(a) shall not (x) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to Parent or the Company or (y) cure any breach of the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions contained in this Agreement, as the case may be.

        (b)   The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any notice or other communication received by it from any third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior
to the Effective Time, alleging any material breach of, or material default under, any Company Material Contract. In addition, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other material communication received by such party from any third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time, regarding any consent that is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that the
delivery of notice by the Company to Parent, or Parent to the Company, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 5.11(b) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to Parent or the Company, respectively.

        Section 5.12    Stockholder Litigation.     The Company shall promptly (and in any event, within two (2) Business Days) advise Parent of any Action commenced or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, has been threatened to be commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors by any Company Stockholder (whether on its or their own behalf or on
behalf of the Company) relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (any such Action, "Stockholder Litigation"), and shall
keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to review and comment on all filings and responses to be made by the Company
in connection with (which such comments the Company will in good faith take into account), and to participate and consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of, any
Stockholder Litigation and shall consider Parent's views with respect to any Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall not settle, compromise or enter into any arrangement, or consent to the
entry of, or fail to defend against entry of, any order or judgment, with respect to any Stockholder Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent; provided, that the prior written consent
of Parent shall not be required for any such settlement, compromise, arrangement, order or judgment that does not (x) require any monetary payment to be made directly or indirectly by the
Company, other than the payment of de minimis amounts (for the avoidance of doubt, any payments by the Company's Director and Officer liability insurance carriers shall not be considered a
monetary payment to be made directly or indirectly by the Company), (y) include an admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of the Company or any of its directors or (z) directly or
indirectly impose any other obligations on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than customary administerial requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to be a limitation on the right of the Company to honor obligations of indemnification to the Company's directors in accordance with the terms thereof. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall not enter into any settlement agreement, or permit entry of any order or judgment, in respect of any Stockholder Litigation without the prior written consent of the Company, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

of Parent and its Subsidiaries in the Financing Commitment Letters (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) or obtain a waiver of such conditions, (but in each
case excluding any conditions where the failure to be so satisfied is a result of the Company's failure to furnish information required under this Agreement or the Company's material
breach of any of its other obligations under this Agreement) and comply in all material respects with its obligations thereunder and (iii) diligently and in good faith enforce its rights
under the Financing Commitment Letters.

        (b)   In the event that all conditions to the Financing have been satisfied, the Marketing Period has expired and all of the conditions to Closing hereunder have been satisfied,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing to be funded on the Closing Date.

        (c)   Parent shall not have the right to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or consent to or waive any provision or any of its rights under, the Financing Commitment
Letters if such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification, consent or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing from that contemplated in the Financing
Commitment Letters to an amount less than the Required Amount, (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set
forth in the Financing Commitment Letters or modify the terms of the Financing (other than as permitted herein), in each case in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
(x) prevent or materially impede or materially delay the timely funding of the Required Amount on the Closing Date or (y) materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitment Letters when required pursuant to this Agreement (the new or additional conditions precedent described in this
clause (ii) referred to as "Prohibited Conditions"). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company a true and complete copy of any such amendment or modification. References to

of its covenants or agreements in this Section 5.14 if the Closing occurs.

termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing Commitment Letters of which Parent becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt by Parent of any notice or other communication from
any Financing Source with respect to any actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by such party to the Financing Commitment Letters, of any provisions thereto
and (iii) of the occurrence of any event or development that Parent expects to have a material and adverse impact on the ability of Parent to obtain the timely funding of the Required
Amount on the Closing Date. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within three (3) Business Days of the date the Company delivers Parent a written request, Parent shall
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence.

alternative financing sources (1) in an amount at least equal to the amount of the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion thereof (in each case, after giving effect to any increase, if
any, in the amount of the equity financing to be provided pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter) and (2) which such Alternative Financing shall not be subject to any conditions
precedent that would constitute Prohibited Conditions, provided that Parent shall not be required to (x) seek equity financing from any source other than those counterparty to the
Equity Commitment Letter, (y) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof or (z) agree to conditionality or economic
terms that are less favorable in the aggregate (including any market flex provisions set forth in the fee letter) than those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the
date hereof and (ii) promptly thereafter, deliver to the Company a true and complete fully executed new financing commitment letter (together with the related fee letter, subject to
redaction consistent with Section 4.8(a)) with respect to such Alternative Financing.

without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a party fails promptly to pay to the other party any amounts due pursuant

the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee, does not constitute a penalty, but rather shall constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate a party

        Section 8.4    Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.     This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) (a) constitutes the entire agreement,
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral (except for the Confidentiality Agreement and the Guaranty), among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and neither party is relying on any other oral or written representation, agreement or understanding and no party makes any express or implied representation or warranty in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than as set forth in this Agreement, and (b) except for the provisions of Section 2.6 (which after the Effective Time are intended to

directors of the Company and its Affiliates and their respective heirs, executors, estates and personal representatives), Section 7.3(d) (which is intended to benefit the Company Recourse

extent contemplated thereby) is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies.

        Section 8.5    Governing Law.     All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict of laws. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees that any claim or cause of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise), against any Financing Source, in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt
Financing or the definitive agreements executed in connection therewith or the performance thereof, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws.

        Section 8.6    Amendments and Supplements.     This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented at any time solely by additional written agreements signed by, or on behalf of
the parties, as may mutually be determined by the parties to be necessary, desirable or expedient to further the purpose of this Agreement or to clarify the intention of the parties, whether
before or after adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders or adoption of this Agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub; provided, however, that after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval or adoption of this Agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, no amendment may be made to this Agreement that pursuant to applicable law would
require further approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub without such further approval or adoption; provided, further, that none of

be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed
by, or on behalf of, each of the parties in interest at the time of such amendment.

        Section 8.7    Waiver.     No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a written instrument signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay
by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies provided herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no waiver of Section 7.3(f) , Section 7.3(g), Section 8.4, Section 8.5, Section 8.6, this Section 8.7, Section 8.8, Section 8.12, Section 8.13 or Section 8.14 (or any
other provision of this Agreement to the extent such wavier would waive or modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) that is adverse to the interests of any Financing Source
will be effective against such Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Financing Source adversely affected thereby.

        Section 8.8    Assignment.     Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or
otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part from time to time, to (a) one or more of its Affiliates, (b) to any parties providing secured debt financing for purposes of creating a
security interest herein or otherwise assigning this Agreement as collateral in respect of such secured debt financing, and (c) after the Effective Time, to any Person; provided that any such
assignment by Parent or Merger Sub shall not, nor shall it purport to, relieve Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors of any of their respective liabilities or obligations hereunder. Any
assignment in violation of the preceding two sentences shall be void. Subject to the preceding three sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

        Section 8.9    Headings.     The headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

        Section 8.10    Severability.     If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated
by the parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.

        Section 8.11    Failure or Delay Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.     No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be
construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

        Section 8.12    Specific Performance.     The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions

to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. It is explicitly agreed that the Company shall have the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in
connection with enforcing Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the Equity Financing to be funded (including to cause Parent to enforce the obligations
of the Guarantors under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely completed in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Equity Commitment Letter) only in the event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (a) the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (provided that each such condition is then capable of being satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived at the time Closing would
otherwise be required to occur pursuant to Section 2.4 but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, and the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 remain satisfied; (b) the Debt
Financing is available to be funded at the Closing and has been funded in accordance with its terms or will be funded in accordance with its terms at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded; and (c) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, then the
Company will take such actions as are within its control to effect the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically
Parent's right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded at the Closing). In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement other than solely under the specific circumstances and as
specifically set forth in this Section 8.12.

        Section 8.13    Waiver of Jury Trial.     EACH OF THE COMPANY, PARENT AND MERGER SUB HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER AND THE DEBT FINANCING), INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST OR INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE, OR THE ACTIONS OF THE COMPANY, PARENT, MERGER SUB OR ANY FINANCING SOURCE
IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

        Section 8.14    Consent to Jurisdiction.     Each of the parties hereto hereby\ (a) irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit itself to the sole and exclusive personal jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over
such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware) (collectively, the "Delaware Courts") in connection with any dispute, claim, or
controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in any of the Delaware
Courts, (c) agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum and agrees not otherwise to attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction or venue by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees that it will not bring any action, suit, or proceeding in connection with any dispute,
claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in any court or other tribunal, other than any of the Delaware Courts. All actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Courts. Each of the

be deemed to limit or prohibit service of process by any other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any claim or cause of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise), against any Financing Source, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or the definitive agreements
executed in connection therewith or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), and each party waives any objection which such
party may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such action, suit or proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any such action, suit or
proceeding.

their status is, and at all times shall continue to be, that of independent contractors with respect to each other. No party shall have any power or authority to bind or commit any other party. No
party shall hold itself out as having any authority or relationship in contravention of this Section 8.16.

The Board of Directors of
CommerceHub, Inc.
201 Fuller Road, 6th Floor
Albany, New York 12203

Members of the Board of Directors:

        We understand that CommerceHub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger
Agreement"), with Great Dane Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Parent"), and Great Dane Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Merger Sub"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
with the Company surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of Series A common stock, par value $0.01 per share
("Series A Common Stock"), Series B common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Series B Common Stock"), and Series C common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Series C Common Stock"
and, together with the Series A Common Stock and Series B Common Stock, the "Company Common Stock"), other than (i) Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (ii) shares
of Company Common Stock owned by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub and shares held in the Company's treasury) immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (iii) shares of Company Common Stock held by individual Company Stockholders who are officers or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries and who agree
otherwise with Parent pursuant to Section 2.6(b) of the Merger Agreement (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), together, "Excluded Common Stock"), will be converted into the right to receive $22.75 per
share, without interest thereon (the "Per Share Merger Consideration"). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement, and terms used herein and
not defined shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

        The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors") has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Per Share Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than the Significant Company Stockholder (which, for purposes of this letter, shall include Malone CHUB 2017 Charitable Remainder
Unitrust) and its Affiliates (including any Specified Persons or their Affiliates) and Frank Poore (the "Founder") (collectively, the "Excluded Stockholders")) entitled to receive such Per Share
Merger Consideration.

        In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:

(i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we deemed to be relevant, including publicly available research analysts'
estimates; 

(ii) reviewed certain non-public historical financial statements and other non-public historical financial and operating data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to us by
management of the Company; 

(iii) reviewed certain non-public projected financial data relating to the Company for fiscal years 2018 through 2020 prepared and furnished to us by management of the Company
on February 19, 2018 (the "Financial Projections"), together with extrapolations of the Financial Projections for fiscal years 2021 through 2022, based on and extrapolated from
the Financial Projections, and projected unlevered free cash flow for fiscal years 2023 through 2032, furnished to us by management of the Company (the "Extended Financial
Projections");

(iv) reviewed certain non-public historical and projected operating data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to us by management of the Company; 

(v) discussed the past and current operations, financial projections and current financial condition of the Company with management of the Company (including their views on the
risks and uncertainties of achieving such projections); 

(vi) reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock and Series C Common Stock and the premium to be
received by the holders of such shares; 

(vii) compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those of certain other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant; 

(viii) compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger with those of certain other transactions that we deemed relevant; 

(ix) performed discounted cash flow analyses on the Company based on forecasts and other data prepared by management of the Company; 

(x) reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated March 5, 2018 (the most recent draft made available to us), which we have assumed is in substantially final form and from
which we assume the final form will not vary in any respect material to our analysis; 

(xi) reviewed a draft of the form of voting agreement, dated March 2, 2018 (the most recent draft made available to us) (the "Voting Agreement"), which we have assumed is in
substantially final form and from which we assume the final form will not vary in any respect material to our analysis; and 

(xii) performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without undertaking any independent verification of, the accuracy and completeness of all of the information
publicly available and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or reviewed by us, and we assume no liability therefor. With respect to the Financial
Projections and the Extended Financial Projections, we have been advised by management of the Company, and have assumed, at the direction of the Board of Directors, that they have been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company.
We express no view as to the Financial Projections or Extended Financial Projections or the assumptions on which they are based. We have relied, at your direction, without independent
verification, upon the assessments of the management of the Company as to the Company's historical and projected financial performance.

        For purposes of rendering our opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement
and the Voting Agreement are true and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and the Voting
Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without material waiver or modification thereof. We have assumed that each of the executed Merger

Agreement will conform in all material respects to the drafts we reviewed. We have further assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the
consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any material delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or the
consummation of the Merger or would materially reduce the benefits to the holders of the Company Common Stock of the Merger.

        We have not made nor assumed any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such
appraisals, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily
based upon information made available to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they exist and as can be evaluated on the date hereof. It is understood
that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

        We have not been asked to pass upon, and we express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than the
Excluded Stockholders), without regard to differences, including as to relative voting rights, trading volumes, trading value and premiums or otherwise, between or among the Series A
Common Stock, the Series B Common Stock and the Series C Common Stock, from a financial point of view, of the Per Share Merger Consideration. We do not express any view on, and our
opinion does not address, the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration to be received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other securities, creditors or other constituencies of
the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company (including the Founder), or
any class of such persons, whether relative to the Per Share Merger Consideration or otherwise, nor as to the relative fairness of the Per Share Merger Consideration as between holders of the
Series A Common Stock, Series B Common Stock, Series C Common Stock or any combination thereof. We have assumed that any modification to the structure of the transaction will not
vary in any respect material to our analysis. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to the
Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger. This letter, and our opinion, does not constitute a recommendation to the Board of
Directors or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holder of shares of Company Common Stock should vote or act in respect of the Merger. We express no
opinion herein as to the price at which shares of the Company will trade at any time. We are not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and have assumed the accuracy and completeness of
assessments by the Company and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.

        We will receive a fee for our services upon the rendering of this opinion. The Company has also agreed to reimburse our expenses and to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out
of our engagement. We will also be entitled to receive a success fee if the Merger is consummated. During the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship existed between
Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates and the Company (other than the engagement in connection with the Merger) or Parent or any of its affiliates pursuant to which compensation was
received by Evercore Group L.L.C. or its affiliates as a result of such a relationship, provided, however, that Evercore has represented affiliates of Parent in other acquisition and sale
transactions for which Evercore Group L.L.C. or its affiliates received compensation. We may provide financial or other services to the

        In the ordinary course of business, Evercore Group L.L.C. or its affiliates may actively trade the securities, or related derivative securities, or financial instruments of the Company and its
affiliates or any of Parent's affiliates for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or instruments.

        This letter, and the opinion expressed herein, is addressed to, and for the information and benefit of, the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the proposed Merger. The
issuance of this opinion has been approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore Group L.L.C.

        This opinion may not be disclosed, quoted, referred to or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval, except
the Company may reproduce this opinion in full in any document that is required to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and required to be mailed by the Company to
its stockholders relating to the Merger; provided, however, that all references to us or our opinion in any such document and the description or inclusion of our opinion therein shall be subject
to our prior consent with respect to form and substance, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Per Share Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded Stockholders) entitled to receive such Per Share Merger Consideration.

Annex C 

Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware 

§262. Appraisal rights.

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares,
who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in
favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to §228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's
shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation;
the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository
representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to §251 (other than a
merger effected pursuant to §251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, §251(h) of this title), §252, §254, §255, §256, §257, §258, §263 or §264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in §363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of
stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon
the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no
appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of
the surviving corporation as provided in §251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation
if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such
stock anything except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository
receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing
paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under §251(h), §253 or §267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately
prior to

the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by §363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by
§363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word
"amendment" substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting
corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an
amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as
nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation,
not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in
accordance with §255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for
any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy
of §114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or
consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and
that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the
surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the
merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to §228, §251(h), §253, or §267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger
or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are
entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of §114 of this title. Such notice may, and,
if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to
appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of
the offer contemplated by §251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such
holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it

reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not
notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or
consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if
such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §251(h) of this title, later than the later of the
consummation of the offer contemplated by §251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is
entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the
transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to
the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date
is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of
the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or
consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof,
upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not
voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement
shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the
beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation
the statement described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such
service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for
their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting
corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of
such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein

stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington,
Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may
require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If
immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national
securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to
appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of
shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to §253 or §267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any
rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum
of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon
application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal
prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment
shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the
corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting
corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the
Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal

proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to
vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which
is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if
such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation,
either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right
of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval
of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or

prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the Expiration Date ("New Shares") shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if
they comprised the Shares.

        2.    Agreement to Vote Shares.     

        (a)   Until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the Expiration Date, at any meeting of the Company Stockholders called with respect to any of the following, and at every
adjournment thereof, as permitted by the Merger Agreement, Holder shall appear at such meeting (in person or by proxy) and shall vote the Shares and any New Shares (or cause the
Shares and any New Shares to be voted) (i) in favor of (x) adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and (y) any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and (ii) against any

and agrees not to enter into any agreement or understanding with any Person with respect to voting of its Shares on any Covered Actions which conflicts with the terms of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require Holder to vote in favor of, or otherwise act by written consent with respect to, any amendment to
the Merger Agreement or the taking of any action that would result in the amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision therein, in any such case, in a manner that decreases the
amount or changes the form of the Merger Consideration payable to the Company Stockholders or is otherwise materially adverse to the Company Stockholders in their capacity as
Company Stockholders.

        (b)   Holder further agrees that, until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the Expiration Date, Holder will not, and will not permit any entity under Holder's control to,

Business Day by a nationally recognized overnight courier.

        (f)    Severability.    If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable under applicable Law, the parties agree to renegotiate such provision in good faith, in
order to maintain the economic position enjoyed by each party as close as possible to that under the provision rendered unenforceable. In the event that the parties cannot reach a
mutually agreeable and enforceable replacement for such provision, then (i) such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement, (ii) the balance of the Agreement shall be
interpreted as if such provision were so excluded and (iii) the balance of the Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

        (g)    No Ownership Interest.    Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent or any of its Affiliates any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of

Company, Parent and Merger Sub to sustain damages for which they would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages, and therefore each of the parties hereto agrees that
in the event of any such breach Company or Parent, as applicable, shall be entitled to the remedy of specific performance of such covenants and agreements and injunctive and other
equitable relief in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity.

        (i)    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.    EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY

OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8(i).

        (j)    Expenses.    Parent shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Holder, including the reasonable fees, charges, and disbursements of counsel for
the Holder, in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in an amount not to exceed $75,000 in
the aggregate. Parent shall pay to Holder $35,000 of such costs and expenses reasonably promptly following the date hereof, with the balance to be paid by Parent to Holder in
connection with the consummation of the Merger or valid termination of the Merger Agreement. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each party shall bear its own
expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

            i.  Company (the "Indemnifying Party") covenants and agrees, on the terms and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, to indemnify and hold harmless
Holder and Holder's trustees, beneficiaries, representatives and advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party"), from and against any and all Losses incurred in connection with, arising
out of or resulting from any claims, demands, actions, proceedings or investigations (collectively, "Actions") relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement

this Section 9(k), "Losses" means any loss (including disgorgement of consideration), liability, cost, damage or expense (including, without duplication, reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, consultants and other experts) related to an Action for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement;

any Losses which (x) result from such Indemnified Party's willful misconduct or gross negligence or (y) result primarily from any breach of any representation or warranty of
such Indemnified Party contained in this Agreement or any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by such Indemnified Party under this Agreement.

          iii.  The Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section 9(k) regardless of whether such Losses are incurred prior to or after the
Effective Time. The indemnification provided pursuant to this Section 9(k) is in addition to, and not in derogation of, the rights of any Indemnified Party under Section 9(j), any
other rights an Indemnified Party may have under applicable law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, or pursuant to any contract, agreement or
arrangement; provided, however, that Losses will not be duplicated.

          iv.  Promptly after the receipt by any Indemnified Party of notice of any Action that is or may be subject to indemnification hereunder (each, an "Indemnifiable Claim")
(and in no event more than ten Business Days after the Indemnified Party's receipt of written notice of such Indemnifiable Claim), such Indemnified Party shall give written
notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, which notice will include, to the extent known, the basis for such Indemnifiable Claim and copies of any pleadings or written demands
relating to such Indemnifiable Claim and, promptly following request therefor, shall provide any additional information in respect thereof that the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request; provided, however, that (x) any delay in giving or failure to give such notice will not affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Party hereunder except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result of such delay in or failure to notify and (y) no such notice shall be required to be given to the Indemnifying Party
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party or any of its respective Affiliates is a party to any such Indemnifiable Claim.

           v.  Subject to Section 9(k)(vi) and Section 9(k)(vii), the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to exercise full control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any
Indemnifiable Claim in respect of an Action commenced or made by a Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement (a "Third Party
Indemnifiable Claim") so long as, within ten calendar days after the receipt of notice of such Third Party Indemnifiable Claim from the Indemnified Party (pursuant to

forth in this Agreement, to such Third Party Indemnifiable Claim and that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify such Indemnified Party in respect of such Third Party
Indemnifiable Claim to the extent required by this Section 9(k), and (y) notify such Indemnified Party in writing that the Indemnifying Party will assume the control of the
defense thereof. Following notification to such Indemnified Party of the assumption of the defense of such Third Party Indemnifiable Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall retain
legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such Third Party Indemnifiable Claim. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes the
defense of any such Third Party Indemnifiable Claim in accordance herewith, subject to the provisions of clauses (iv) through (vi) of this Section 9(k), (A) the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to exercise full control of the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Indemnifiable Claim and such Indemnified Party shall cooperate
(subject to the Indemnifying Party's agreement to reimburse such Indemnified Party for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with such cooperation) with the Indemnifying Parties in any manner that the Indemnifying Party reasonably may request in connection with the defense, compromise or
settlement thereof (subject to the last sentence of this Section 9(k)(v)), and (B) such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel selected by such
Indemnified Party and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise or settlement thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
one such separate counsel, and, if reasonably necessary, one local counsel. No Indemnified Party shall settle or compromise or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to
any such Action for which it is entitled to indemnification without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to assume
the defense thereof as contemplated in this Section 9(k)(v), in which case such Indemnified Party will be entitled to control the defense, compromise or settlement thereof at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party. Without the prior written consent of each of the Indemnified Parties who are named in the Action subject to the Third Party Indemnifiable
Claim (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the Indemnifying Party will not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment
with respect to any Indemnifiable Claim (or part thereof) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Parties,
(y) does not include any admission of wrongdoing on the part of such Indemnified Parties and (z) does not enjoin or restrict in any way the future actions or conduct of such
Indemnified Parties.

          vi.  Notwithstanding Section 9(k)(v), an Indemnified Party, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, (x) shall, subject to the last sentence of this Section 9(k)(vi), be
entitled to separately control the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third Party Indemnifiable Claim as to such Indemnified Party if, in the judgment of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, there exists any actual conflict of interest relating to the defense of such Action between the Indemnifying Party and one or more Indemnified Parties and
(y) shall be entitled to assume control of the defense, compromise and settlement of any Third Party Indemnifiable Claim as to which the Indemnifying Party have previously
assumed control in the event the Indemnifying Party are not timely and diligently pursuing such defense. No Indemnified Party shall settle or compromise or consent to entry of
any judgment with respect to any Action with respect to which it controls the defense thereof pursuant to this Section 9(k)(vi) and for which it is entitled to indemnification
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

         vii.  In all instances under this Section 9(k) where the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay the fees, costs and expenses of the Indemnified Parties, such fees, costs and
expenses shall be reasonable. The parties agree to cooperate and coordinate in connection with the defense, compromise or settlement of any Indemnifiable Claims.

        viii.  In addition to (but without duplication of) the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification as set forth in this Section 9(k), if so requested by an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall also advance to such Indemnified Party (within ten Business Days of such request) any and all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by an
Indemnified Party in accordance with this Section 9(k) in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including any appeal), or preparing to
defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Indemnifiable Claim, including, without duplication, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, consultants and other
experts (an "Expense Advance").

          ix.  Holder agrees that it will repay Expense Advances made to it (or paid on its behalf) by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 9(k) if it is ultimately finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that it is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 9(k).
